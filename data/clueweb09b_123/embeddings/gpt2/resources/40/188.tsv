PURPOSE           This regulation            describes Department policy on the payment of publicÊ transportation            incentives and provides the guidelines within which mission areas and            staff offices may authorize payment to employees for the use of qualifying            mass transit.             2. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS           This regulation            concerns employee benefits and budget planning. No additional funding            is available to the transit incentive. Mission areas and staff offices            will therefore need to review their budgets carefully taking into consideration            all funding needs. Highest priority should be placed on avoiding furlough            and reduction in force.             3. AUTHORITY           This regulation            is issued pursuant to the Federal Employees Clean Air Incentive Act            of 1993, Public Law 103-172, dated December 2, 1993, and the Transportation            Equity Act for the 21st Century, Public Law 105-178, dated June 9, 1998.           4. COVERAGE            This regulation            covers all employees as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 employed by the U.S.            Department of Agriculture.            Subcabinet Officials            may approve the use of the transit incentive for their organizations.            This decision may be further delegated to Agency Administrators. This            incentive may be offered in several variations:                        Benefits              in Addition to Compensation: Under this option employees may be given              financial incentives of up to $65 per month, or the actual commute              cost, whichever is less, in addition to their urrent compensation.              This amount, which is nontaxable, is indexed for inflation, and may              be increased to $100 per month after December 31, 2001.             Benefits in Lieu              of Compensation: USDA employees are permitted to set aside up to the              Federal nontaxable limit (see above) or the actual commute cost, whichever              is less, of their gross income before taxes are computed, to pay for              qualifying transit. Mission areas/agencies/staff offices do not pay              for this benefit. (This benefit is not currently available. The National              Finance Center (NFC) must modify the personnel/payroll system to accommodate              the in lieu of compensation benefit.Ê NFC will notify all users when              programming changes are complete.)             Combination:              Subcabinet Officials can give their employees part of the commuting              expense tax-free in addition to their compensation and allow compensation              to pay the remaining amount, up to the total monthly limit. (See note              in above paragraph regarding NFC system modification).             Consistency:              At a minimum, there must be consistent administration of the transit              incentive programÊ within an agency and it must take into consideration              the following elements:                                Responsible                  official(s). Subcabinet Officials will identify an official responsible                  for implementation and operation of the program, if administration                  is not further delegated to the agency level. If administration                  of the program is further delegated, Agency Administrators will                  identify the responsible official. Prior to extending the transit                  incentive to employees, mission areas/agencies or staff offices                  are to provide the Assistant Secretary for Administration with                  an implementation plan, including projected costs and point of                  contact for record purposes.                 Eligible                  employees. Subcabinet Officials or Agency Administrators will                  identify the employees who may receive the transit incentive.                  All applicants will be verified for eligibility. They may not                  be employees who received Federal motor vehicle parking benefits,                  and they must agree to use qualified transit for their regular                  daily commute. All participants shall present USDA ID cards and                  be recertified (quarterly or monthly, depending how frequently                  fare media are distributed) to ensure they are still eligible                  and are receiving only one benefit per month.                 Qualifying                  transit: Public transportation or mass transit and certain van                  pools are qualified methods of transit. Qualifying van pools or                  commuter highway vehicles must have a seating capacity of at least                  6 adults, not including the driver, and at least 80 percent of                  the mileage use must be for transporting employees in connection                  with travel between their homes and places of employment.                  Notification                  of availability: Mission areas/agencies and staff offices will                  notify employees of the availability of the transit incentive.                 Obtaining                  the transit incentive. Mission areas/agencies and staff offices                  will inform employees of procedures for applying for the transit                  incentive and will designate a headquarters office contact to                  review proposed transit benefit programs in field locations and                  oversee operation of field programs. Cash reimbursements shall                  not be used if a voucher or a transit pass is readily available                  for direct distribution to employees. Fare media (e.g., Metro                  checks) are to be used only for the commute to and/or from work.                  Giving and selling fare media to others, or purchasing fare media                  from another individual, is prohibited.                                       Records. Mission              areas/staff offices must maintain records to ensure recording of and              accounting for expenditures to facilitate preparation of reports.              All fare media shall be ordered, verified, stored, dispensed, balanced,              and recorded in a manner that ensures protection against loss and              maintains records of transactions.             Reports. Participating              mission areas/staff offices will be required to submit a report each              fiscal year to the Assistant Secretary for Administration by October              31. Report specifications will be provided by the Office of Human              Resources Management.             Effective date.              The effective date is the date of this regulation.                                  Home             |  USDA  |  Office            of Human Resources Management

REPLACEMENT HIGHLIGHTS   This Directive replaces GIPSA Directive 4060.2, Transit Incentive Program, dated 6/1/00.      4.  BACKGROUND   The 1998 Transportation Equity Act allows employers to provide transit incentives to cover part of their employees' transportation costs. Two incentives were offered: the tax set-aside and the direct subsidy (""transit voucher""). E.O. 13150 mandated that by October 1, 2000, agencies provide transit subsidies to employees who commute via mass transit or qualified vanpools.   At a minimum, agencies must offer headquarters employees an agency-paid subsidy and field employees a pre-tax benefit. Agencies may also offer a pre-tax parking benefit to those employees who drive, and then park their cars in order to take mass transit and/or a vanpool as part of their daily commute to/from work. The program is meant to improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion.        5.  POLICY      MRP encourages employees to commute to work by other than single occupant vehicles.

Only MRP employees who are not receiving a Federal parking benefit may participate in the transit incentive program.    Participation is limited to employees who agree to use public transportation or a qualifying vanpool for their regular daily commute to/from work.    Employees will not give or sell transit passes to others or purchase fare media from other Federal employees.           6.  FALSE RECORDS   Employees who make false certifications or fail to re-certify their application for benefits quarterly, or whenever necessary, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including removal from Federal service.

GX067-87-3134625	"USDA NEWS                                                             VOLUME 58 NO. 7 — September 1999       Using Public Transit Can Put Cash Back In Our Pockets      Subways Qualify; Car Pools Don't        by Ron Hall, Office of Communications   Since December 1998 USDA agencies have had the option to participate in a ""transit incentive"" program, designed to encourage employees at headquarters and field offices to use public transportation. And since certain tax-related questions have recently been resolved, participating agencies now have an additional form of participation to choose, if they wish to pursue it.      In Departmental Regulation No. 4060-2 dated December 15, 1998, and titled ""Transit Incentives,"" USDA outlined its new policy on authorizing monetary incentives to employees who use qualifying forms of public transportation to commute to and from their USDA workplace.    The regulation noted that USDA's subcabinet officials have the option of approving the use of transit incentives for their organizations, and can delegate that decision to agency administrators. But it said ""No additional funding is available to pay the transit incentive.""    ""Mission areas and staff offices will therefore need to review their budgets carefully taking into consideration all funding needs,"" the regulation advised. ""Highest priority should be placed on avoiding furlough and reduction in force.""    Elizabeth Daly , a personnel management specialist in the Office of Human Resources Management, explained that ‘public' or ‘mass' transportation covered under USDA's regulation includes travel by bus, subway, train, and ferry boats. In addition, van pools qualify if they include at least six adult passengers plus the driver, and at least 80 percent of the van's mileage is for transporting employees between their homes and places of work. Car pools, irrespective of size, do not qualify.    She said that USDA's new regulation reflects a change in the Department's position on this issue. Public Law 101-509, which was signed into law on November 5, 1990, allowed--but did not require--federal departments to participate in programs to encourage use of public transportation. ""But then--as now--no additional funds were appropriated to pay for the cost incentives,"" she said.    USDA officials subsequently reviewed the matter but, citing budgetary reasons, opted in March 1992 to not participate as a Department in such a program. The May 1992 issue of the  USDA News  carried a story about that decision.    Then in 1997, based on an agreement between the Foreign Agricultural Service and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Union, FAS employees at GS-10 and below were allowed to participate in a transit incentive program.    According to  Gloria Abbott , an FAS budget analyst who administers the program, FAS employees who qualified could receive a ""Metrochek""--that is, an actual subway card--worth up to $25 a month tax free. Riders who use forms of public transportation other than subway could turn that subway card into a local public transportation office and exchange it for a ‘fare medium' such as bus passes or tokens or vouchers for other accepted forms of public transportation. The maximum amount has since increased to $30 a month tax free for qualifying FAS employees, and FAS's program has since expanded to cover GS-11 employees too.    Later that same year, following an office move to a more congested part of downtown Washington, DC, Economic Research Service Administrator  Susan Offutt  adopted a transit subsidy program for ERS employees, all of whom work in Washington, DC.    ""The increased congestion, high cost of parking, and excellent access to public transportation made the transit subsidy a particularly attractive option,"" explained  Vicki Smith , assistant to the ERS administrator and coordinator of that agency's program when it began.    ERS's subsidy also relies on the ""Metrochek"" plan, but its maximum reimbursement is $65 monthly tax free for its employees who use qualifying forms of mass transit.    In 1998 USDA officials decided to review the Department's earlier decision in 1992 that it would not participate, as a Department, in transit incentives. Departmental Regulation No. 4060-2 resulted from that review.    Daly explained that USDA agencies which elect to participate in some form of transit incentive have three basic options, as follows:      Benefits in Addition to Compensation --Under this option, the benefit provided to USDA employees is in some form of actual ‘Metrochek-like' subway card, bus pass or token, or some form of voucher, up to $65 per month tax free. This is provided in addition to--but is not included in--an employee's paycheck.        Benefits in Lieu of Compensation- -Under this option, USDA employees are permitted to ""set aside up to the federal nontaxable limit...or the actual commute cost, whichever is less, of their gross income before taxes are computed, to pay for qualifying transit."" USDA agencies do not pay for this benefit.    And just what does all that language mean? ""Under this option,"" Daly advised, ""employees are, in effect, sheltering a portion of their income from taxes--and it is equal to the amount they pay monthly in mass transit costs, subject to the $65 ceiling.""     She added that this option is similar to how an employee's Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions are treated for tax purposes. As with the TSP, this transaction is reflected on an employee's Statement of Earnings and Leave.     In June 1999 the National Finance Center in New Orleans developed a procedure to accommodate this option.     Combination- -Under this option, USDA employees may receive a ‘Metrochek-like' form of reimbursement, as described in the first option above,  plus  a ‘Thrift Savings Plan-like' tax shelter, as described in the second option above--all not to exceed the $65 monthly ceiling.    USDA agencies which opt to participate in some form of transit incentive are responsible for setting up their own programs, identifying a point of contact, and maintaining appropriate records of its expenditures. ""     So far in 1999 we've seen increased use of these options by our headquarters employees who qualify and whose agencies are participating,"" Daly noted. ""We encourage similarly qualified field employees to consider these options as well.""                Inside the  ""USDA NEWS""      News and Current Information   Past Issues      USDA's ...

GX042-40-5075182	"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT  WASHINGTON, D.C.  20240      November 1, 2001      In Reply Refer To:  1400-990 (WO-710)P      EMS TRANSMISSION 11/01/01  Instruction Memorandum No. 2002-023  Expires: 09/30/03           To:               All BLM Employees               From:     Assistant Director, Human Resources Management                Subject:     Public Transportation Benefit Program                                            DD: 11/15/01              Program Area:   Human Resources Management, Quality of Worklife Programs       Purpose:   This Instruction Memorandum (IM) provides updated information on the Public Transportation Benefit Program.  Employees must submit a new application in order to continue to participate in the program or to newly join the program.        Policy/Action:        Employees Currently Participating in the Program.   Currently, employees are eligible to receive up to a maximum of $65.00 per month to cover commuting expenses.  In January 2002, the transit benefit will increase to a maximum of $100 per month.  As a result of this increase, it is necessary for employees to reapply for the program.   It is important to understand that if you do not re-apply, you will be dropped from the program and will not receive any transit benefit for the period (January through March 2002).   All applications must be received by your Public Transportation Benefit Program Coordinator (Attachment 1) by November 15, 2001.  Only the most recent version of the application form will be accepted and processed.  The application form is available on the Department of Interior website at  http://www.doi.gov/pfm/travel.html .  Should you not have internet access, please contact your program coordinator.  Other than the increase in the transit subsidy, the program for this group of employees will operate as it has in the past.              (B) Employees Interested in Participating in the Program.   In October 2000, the Public Transportation Benefit Program was implemented in the Department of the Interior with the continued assistance from the Department of Transportation (DOT).  The program encourages employees to use mass transit for commuting to and from work by offering a financial incentive.  The transit benefit is used to cover ""qualifying transportation expenses"".  Qualifying transportation expenses include: (1) the use of mass transit facilities (subway, rail, bus) or other similar public transportation mode; and (2) the use of ""Commuter Highway Vehicle"" (having a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (not including the driver) and which is used for transporting employees to and from work for at least 80% of the mileage).  Van pools would typically satisfy the criteria for vehicles of this type, while car pools would not.  Additional information on this program can be found on the above website.  The website also contains a question and answer section.  If you decide to participate in the program, please submit your application to your local coordinator by November 15, 2001.        Updated Information:  The Department of Transportation (DOT) began a phased-in implementation of all Department of the Interior (DOI) field locations in January 2001.  Many programs are now established and running effectively.  DOT began with those locations that had the highest population of applicants and are now reviewing the remaining locations to determine how they can best be serviced.  Many DOI sites have unique circumstances that prevent DOT from setting up cost-effective programs at this time.  Employees in some BLM locations utilize qualified vanpools, buses, or other forms of mass transit each with different procedures, rate structures, and ticketing systems.  In many cases, DOT does not have existing contracts established with these companies.  In other locations, there is such a limited number of participants that servicing them through DOT would be cost prohibitive.      It is estimated that only a small number of employees are in the type of situation described above.  If you are unsure as to whether your vanpool/bus company, etc., has an established contract with DOT, please check with your local coordinator or Debbie Esposito, WO-710, on (202) 208-4695.  If it is determined that DOT cannot purchase vouchers/passes for you, the use of the SF-1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, has been approved for use effective December 2001.           Procedures for Reimbursement Using the SF-1164:       Participants must have submitted an application through their Public Transportation Benefit Program Coordinator.     Participants will purchase tickets/passes up-front with his/her own funds.  The participant is to retain and maintain receipts and/or cancelled checks to document payment.    Once three months of tickets/passes have been purchased, the participant can complete the SF-1164.  The SF-1164 will be filed at the end of the quarter and will be processed through normal channels.            The participant will complete information in Blocks 1, 4(a), (b), and (c), and (d), 6, 7, 8, 10, and the Accounting Classification at the bottom of the form.  Block 6 must state the employee is seeking reimbursement under the Public Transportation Benefit Program.  The form must include the method of transportation, the period for which the employee is seeking reimbursement, and the amount of the reimbursement.               Under Block 6, Expenditures, include Code C for ""Other Expenses"".          Annotate the months being claimed for the transit subsidy and the total amount claimed  for tickets/passes.  The amount claimed should be the actual amount spent up to $100 per month ($300.00 quarterly).            Attach applicable receipts/supporting documentation to justify claim.         The SF-1164 should be submitted through regular channels for approval.  Once signed, it should be sent to the National Business Center, Accounts Payable Branch, BC-622, for processing.       Timeframe:    Employees must submit their application to their local coordinator on or before Thursday, November 15, 2001.       Budget Impact:  Transit benefit for employees will increase from $65.00 per month up to $100 per month, not to exceed an employee's actual commuting costs.  Budget impact has been coordinated with WO-880.          Background:  The amount of the transit subsidy will be increasing in January 2002.  Employees must be notified of this increase and the need to submit a new application for the program.        Manual/Handbook Sections Affected:  This IM does not affect any manual or handbook.       Coordination:  This document was coordinated with the Budget Group (WO-800) and the National Business Center (BC-650).

Back to 4060 Table of Contents                 Am I Eligible for a Transit Incentive?    You are eligible for this program if you are a current USDA, MRP employee (headquarters or field) and you use public transportation or a registered vanpool for at least 50% of your regular monthly commuting trips to/from work (e.g., you are normally scheduled to work in Riverdale 15 days and at home 5 days per month. Fifteen days is considered 100% of your regular monthly commute. To meet the 50% requirement, you would have to commute via public transportation or registered vanpool at least 8 or more days per month; anything less [due to TDY, leave, etc.] would make you ineligible for benefits for that month. You must return vouchers in any month that this occurs).          Part-Time, Intermittent, and Stay-in-School Employees    If you fall under any of these categories, you are eligible to participate in this program for the days you work for MRP and use public transportation and/or a registered vanpool to commute to/from work.   Remember, you still must use public transportation or a registered van- pool at least 50% of the time.          Is my Vanpool Eligible?    To be eligible for this program, your vanpool must be registered with your local transit authority. If your vanpool is not registered, contact your local transit authority to find out how.   Headquarters employees can register and/or check if their vanpool is already registered by contacting the Washington Metropolitian Area Transit Authority ( www.wmata.com ).          Are Carpools Eligible?    Carpools are not eligible for this program. The program targets single occupancy vehicles and encourages those riders to convert to either mass transit or vanpools. The Government's goal is to ease traffic congestion and improve air quality.          Are Vanpool Owners and Drivers Eligible?    As a vanpool owner or driver you may claim costs if you actually pay to ride in the vanpool and can provide evidence of such payments if requested (e.g., a canceled personal check payable to your vanpool company).   Note : Vanpool owners are solely accountable to the IRS in the event of any audit.             Previous Section  |  Back to Top  |  Next Section   Return to 4060 Table of Contents     Last Updated 01-13-03                                               Inside            APHIS  -  USDA  -  APHIS             -  MRP  -  AMS             -  GIPSA                          Info/Site            Maps  -  Comments/Contact            the WebMaster  -  Disclaimer/Privacy            Statement

Introduction         The following directive provides information and guidance regarding NIH policies and     procedures pertaining to official travel, its authorization and performance, and     submission of claims for reimbursement of expenses. It is intended to assist  civilian     employees  who are required to travel in the performance of their duties, as     well as personnel responsible for the administration of travel regulations.       NOTE:    Rules and regulations in this directive will address     the majoritiy of official Government Travel subjects including sponsored travel.       There are, however, other topics such as payment of expenses connected with the illness or     death of a traveler, invitational travel, and certain relocation allowances that affect     relatively few travel assignments.  If these situations arise, contact your     Administrative Officer for guidance 1 .       Further, although Commissioned Officer (C.O.) travel is outlined in the Joint     Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), certain areas of travel in this Issuance contain the     same policies and procedures referenced in the JFTR ( Web site:    http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/jftr.html ).       Therefore, some Chapters in this Manual will specifically address C.O. travel     requirements and entitlements.         Official Government Travel is either related to:          Temporary duty away from the official duty station (TDY),                 A change of official duty station, a ""relocation"" which entails a Permanent         Change of Station (PCS), or                  Local travel in and around the official duty station.             It is essential that the employee’s travel is authorized with a written or     electronically generated form (Administrative Database (ADB) system) HHS-1 Travel Order     providing sufficient funds for the expenses that will be incurred.  In all cases,     travelers are expected to exercise the same care in spending public funds that a prudent     person would exercise when traveling on personal business.       1   Certain travel authorizations for  non-Federal employees      and relocation service allowances for  non-Federal employees  and     Commissioned Officers of the PHS are outlined in NIH Manual Issuance Chapter 1500-09-00 ( pending     release ).  Provisions pertaining to payment by the Government of expenses in     connection with the death of certain employees and/or their immediate family members are     outlined in FTR Chapter 303 and further detailed in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations     of Authority,  Travel #8 .        B. Authority       The following written authorities are cited as reference points for this directive on     policies and procedures: 31 U.S.C. 1353, 5 U.S.C. 5701  B      5709, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), and the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) contained in Title 41,     Subtitle F, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In cases where NIH directives are     inconsistent with governing promulgations and in cases where there are omissions from the     directives, the governing regulations will normally prevail. Such decisions will rest with     the Director, Office of Financial Management (OFM), NIH.       C. Delegations of Authority       Appropriate delegations of authority at the National Institutes of Health are those     which are published in NIH Manual Issuance  1130  under     ""Travel"". These delegations are also defined in NIH Manual Issuance 1500 Chapter     01-02  C(9)  and  C(10) .       NOTE:  (This Manual Issuance can be accessed on the Web at:  http://www1.od.nih.gov/oma/manualchapters/ )       D.

General             This part of the directive identifies some of the ethical issues              related to travel with which NIH employees may be faced. It also provides              guidance that should be followed in certain situations. Each employee              is responsible for complying with the ethical standards required of              Federal employees in general and of NIH employees in particular. NIH              employees must maintain the highest degree of integrity.                                 B. Authority             Statutory and regulatory authorities related to this area are numerous and     promulgated by Congress, the Comptroller General, the General Services Administration, and     the Office of Government Ethics.                             C. Guidance       The NIH has the statutory authority to accept gifts donated to the Gift Trust Funds     from donors who wish to support the mission of biomedical research under the Public Health     Service (PHS) Act, Sections 231, 301, 405, and 497. The Gift Funds include the     Unconditional Gift Fund, the Conditional Gift Fund, (See NIH Manual Issuance 1500 Chapter     10-00 (C)) Patient’s Benefit Fund  (pending release) .             NIH employees, however, may not accept gifts or donations in conjunction              with travel related situations. Reimbursements offered to employees              to defray either general or specific expenses associated with travel              or transportation are considered to be offers of gifts or donations,              and according to numerous Comptroller General (C.G.) decisions, are              strictly prohibited except as described in 5 U.S.C 4111, 31 U.S.C.              1353, 42 U.S.C. 3506, and 5 U.S.C. 7342 (See NIH Manual Issuance 1500              Chapter 08 ""Acceptance of Payment from Non-Federal Sources to              Cover Travel Expenses"")  (pending release) .                     Private (Nonfederal) Source Contributions . Private source contributions         for travel are supplements to the salary or expenses of Federal employees, and are         improper for two reasons. First, they are prohibited by Title18 U.S.C. 209. Under this         statute, both the giving and the receiving are criminal offenses. Secondly, they are         improper as unauthorized augmentations. To the extent the contribution supplements the         Government salary or other expenditure, including travel associated costs, it is an         augmentation in an indirect sense, the theory being that when Congress appropriates money         for an activity, all expenses of that activity must be borne by that appropriation unless         Congress specifically provides otherwise.                     Exceptions to Private (Nonfederal) Source Contributions .  Under 5 U.S.C.         4111, enacted as part of the Government Employee Training Act, an employee may accept 1)         contributions and awards incident to training in non-Government facilities and 2) payment         of travel, subsistence, and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, but  only         if the donor is a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization . Under legislative authorities 31         U.S.C. 1353, 42 U.S.C. 3506, and 5 U.S.C. 7342, with limited conditions an employee may         accept payment of travel, subsistence, and other related expenses incident to attendance         at meetings and similar functions; in the performance of advisory services; or when         traveling to conduct official duties on behalf of the United States on funding provided by         a foreign government (including international or multinational organizations).  Under 31         U.S.C. 1353, employees and their spouses are prohibited from accepting cash or checks made         payable to the employee and/or the spouse from a non-Federal source for travel or         attendance at  meetings or similar functions.  Cash may still be received and         retained by the employee under the authority to provide advisory services (42 U.S.C. 3506)         or to accept sponsorship under the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act (5 U.S.C. 7342);         however, in this case, the employee is advised to submit the payment to his/her         administrative official for deposit to the appropriation in the most expeditious manner.         NIH personnel vouchering trips for sponsored travel should consult NIH Manual Issuance         1500 Chapter 08  (pending release)  for the directions and proper handling of checks         made payable to the individual traveler. If an employee receives a contribution in cash or         in kind under this section, his/her travel and subsistence allowances must be         appropriately reduced.           The above policies apply to reimbursements for travel performed by NIH employees for         official purposes only. Travel performed incident to ""outside work or         activities"" is contained in NIH Manual Issuance Chapter 2300-735-4, and must be         submitted on a HHS-520 Form ""Request for Approval of Outside Activities.""                 Donations . When made to an employee under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 4111         with the express condition that they be used for an unauthorized purpose they should be         returned to the donor (47 C.G. 319, 1967).                     Retention of Promotional Benefits.  Any promotional         benefit or material received from a travel service provider in         connection with official travel may be retained for personal use by the         employee, as long as such items are obtained under the same conditions         as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the         Government (FTR 301-53.2).                     Denied Boarding  (involuntary bumping) compensation is payable to the         Government,  not  to the individual employee. Since this is not         considered a gift or a promotional item, but is more in         the nature of damages, it is deposited into miscellaneous receipts (See FTR 301-10.116).          NOTE:   Should the traveler receive a benefit, i.e., check         for airfare, the traveler must ensure that the carrier shows the         ""Treasurer of the United States"" as the payee on the         compensation check. The traveler must forward the check immediately to         his/her Administrative Officer (AO) who, in turn, must submit the check         to the OFM Travel, Fellowships and Cashiers Office in Building 31.          Any benefit, i.e., coupon received from the carrier for meals and/or         lodging must be deducted from the traveler's per diem allowance.  However, where the  employee voluntarily vacates his/her seat  and takes a later         flight, he/she may retain overbooking compensation received from the airlines, subject to         offset for any additional travel expenses caused by the voluntary action. (59         C.G. 203,         1980). (For additional guidance, see FTR 301-10.117).                     C onditions of Non-acceptance of Travel Expenses.  Unless authorized         pursuant to an exception, an employee may not accept travel expenses from a prohibited         source.                     A prohibited source means any person who:                                               Is seeking official action by the employee’s agency;                Does business or seeks to do business with the employee’s agency;                Conducts activities regulated by the employee’s agency;                Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or non-performance               of the employee’s official duties; or                Is an organization, a majority of whose members are described in a-d above (5 C.F.R.               2635.203 (d)).                                                             D. NIH Procedures for Acceptance of Nonfederal Source Funds                     Nonfederal source approval.  All offers of payment of official travel         expenses from non-Federal sources must be approved  in advance  and  in writing ,         by the appropriate official (See NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations of Authority,  Travel         # 7 ), prior to acceptance. This will help to provide consistency of interpretation of         applicable statutes and regulations. Administrators are responsible for ensuring all         agency personnel are made aware that such offers must be so approved. This is especially         important for those responsible for approving travel.                     Acceptance of expenses from nonfederal sources.  Travel orders should note         specifically what expenses are being accepted by the traveling employee and under what         authority. The traveling employee will never approve the acceptance of his/her own travel         expenses.                     Record of nonfederal expenses.  A record of all travel expenses accepted         from non-Federal funding will be kept by the Office of Financial Management in a central         file. (For additional information on this subject matter see NIH Manual Issuance 1500         Chapter 08)  (pending release).             1500-01-02 Authorization and Approval of Official Travel                            A. General                     Authorizing Officials  - Following is a list of NIH officials with specific         delegation to authorize and/or approve travel documents  (See Items C(9) and C(10)) .         While some travel-related documents are prepared manually, for the majority of domestic,         foreign, and local travel, the NIH requires the use of the electronic travel orders and         vouchers available on the Administrative Database (ADB) system.                              Automated Travel System Directions: NIH Web Site ""User Guides"" for ADB  -          To initiate and approve travel documents on the ADB, users are required to be properly         trained in travel procedures. Each user must be assigned a set of "" identification""         initials  by his/her Administrative Office. These initials, in conjunction with a         selected ""keyword"", allow access to the ADB. Comprehensive travel courses are         available through the NIH’s Division of Workforce Development (DWD) (Training Center)         and additional information may be obtained from the ADB ""User Guides"" (Domestic,         Foreign, and Local). These guides may be accessed on the following web site:  http://www-isb.cit.nih.gov/dbasdocs.htm .                                  B. Authority                   The FTR requires that the head of an agency authorize or approve all travel. The     FTR allows for the re-delegation of this authority. The approval process of all vouchers     for payment is authorized by Title 31 U.S.C. 3528 ( See Federal Travel Regulations CFR  301-71.203 ).                            C. Delegations of Authority                   The Deputy Director for Management, NIH, is delegated the responsibility of     maintaining the Agency’s authorization and approval system and is particularly     responsible for ensuring compliance with all aspects of the system by Agency employees.     (See NIH Manual Issuance  1130  - Delegations of Authority, Travel).         Authorizations (Travel Orders) and related funding documentation.          The NIH administrative officials listed below ( Item C(9) ) and  C(10) )         have been delegated specific responsibilities for the authorization and/or approval of         travel related documents. These officials review and assess the appropriateness of the         trip, the method of transportation used, the cost estimates set forth for per diem and         travel expenses, and the availability of funds for payment to the traveler.                     Funds available.  Most Federal appropriations that are used to         fund travel are approved on a  fiscal year (FY)  schedule ( October         1 of the current calendar year to September 30 of the coming calendar year ). When         the United States Congress and the President pass the Federal Budget  on or before          October 1 of the current year, monies authorized and obligated for travel purposes  on         or after  the October 1 date are made available.                       Funding from multiple CANs.  Because the NIH workforce is made         up of Federal Civil Service employees, Commissioned Officers of the USPHS, appointees,         fellows, and trainees, their travel funding may be obligated from more than a single         appropriation or CAN. The account used depends upon the employment category of the         employee doing the travel. Although, most of these funds are renewed on a fiscal year         basis, some funds are approved for multiple years and are not affected by the September 30         FY deadline. (Item (7) below.)                      Suspension of Federal funding.  When the United States Congress and the         President  do not  sign the new fiscal year budget or approve a ""continuing         resolution"" (CR) by October 1 of the current year, the Federal Agencies are deemed         ""out of funds"" and must be shut down. All Federal employees,  including         travelers , are ""furloughed.""                     Travel not funded.  When travelers submit authorizations (Travel Orders)         for periods of travel that span both fiscal years (e.g. September 23  B  October 5), approving officials must ensure that the         authorization contains the qualifying statement, "" Subject to the Availability of         Funding"".  This commits only monies from the current FY travel budget, not monies         from the new FY budget that may not be approved.  Travelers should be advised that if         the Federal Budget is not signed and a continuing resolution is not authorized to         temporarily fund the Government, they are expected to return to their permanent duty         station by  midnight September 30 . All expenses incurred after this deadline cannot         be claimed by the traveler or reimbursed by the Government.                     Continuing resolution (CR).  When the United States Congress and the         President do not sign a new fiscal year budget, the President has the option of signing a         ""continuing resolution"". This piece of legislation allows "" emergency         funding""  for Government agencies to continue running for a  limited number of         days  beyond the September 30 midnight deadline. Travel activities may take place         during the continuing resolution period, and expenses are reimbursable.                      Appropriations not affected by the FY date.  Trips authorized from funds         that are not dependent upon the fiscal year renewal date (referenced in item (3) above)         may continue in travel status, and traveler’s expenses are fully reimbursable.                     New FY budget approved.  When the United States Congress and the President         sign the new fiscal year Federal Budget on or before October 1, all travel expenses are         covered. If the employee is in travel status during a period of time that spans both         fiscal years, he/she will be reimbursed for all travel expenses which were incurred before         midnight September 30 from the current FY budget, and reimbursed for all travel expenses         which were incurred after 12:01 a.m. October 1 from the new FY budget.                                   Travel Orders and Vouchers will be prepared accordingly reimbursing                from both appropriations.                              Authorizing Officials - Travel Orders and pre-travel                documents.                                                  NIH Director  may authorize travel for all personnel at                  the NIH.                 The delegation of  authority for foreign travel  for all                  employees of their respective institutes or centers can be referenced                  in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations of Authority,  Travel #9 .                 Delegated  Administrative Officials designated as ""funding                  officials""  authorize domestic travel and approve funding                  for domestic and foreign travel for employees in their IC over-site                  areas.                 The  ""recommending official""  signs travel documents                  for all employees directly under their  supervision                   and, in cases where re-delegation has been authorized, may also                   approve   domestic travel orders  for employees                  under their supervision.                  Budget Officers  who oversee ""management funding""                  in the NIH Clinical Center, authorize both domestic and foreign                  travel orders with approvals at the Administrative and Director’s                  Offices respectively.                 For signature approval for  Actual Expense Allowance (AEA)                  justifications , reference NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #1 .                 The delegation of authority for accepting  payment from a                  nonfederal source  to cover travel-related expenses in cash                  or in kind can be referenced in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #7 .                 For signature approval for  Non-contract air carriers                   and  Foreign air carrier  usage, reference NIH Manual Issuance                  1130 Delegations of Authority,  Travel                  #14 .                  For signature approval for  Premium Class  travel accommodations,                  for travelers with a disability, special needs, or individual                  justification, reference NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #15 .                                  NOTE: Under the current delegations of authority, IC Directors/Deputy                  Directors/Executive Officers have equal delegated authority and                  may authorize and approve travel for each other. For travel that                  requires the signature of a ""Recommending Official"",                  that individual may be either the IC Executive Officer or equivalent                  level or someone who is at the same or higher supervisory level                  than the traveler. In all such cases, these authorities are to                  be retained at the highest administrative level necessary to ensure                  program integrity.                                                             Approval of travel reimbursement claims (Travel                Vouchers) .  Following are the officials with delegated authority                to approve Travel vouchers, including those items requiring specific                approval before reimbursement can be made:                               NIH Delegated  Administrative Officials  who have signature certification for           funding, approve all Travel Vouchers for their respective Institute or Center areas.           Budget Officers  in the NIH Clinical Center approve voucher payments with an           additional Administrative Officer authorizing signature.           The one  exception  to the above rules is the approval of  ""cash""            (use of personal credit cards, personal checks, money orders, etc.) to purchase emergency           or non-emergency transportation tickets costing  over $100  from traveler’s           personal funds. The appropriate official must make the final decision for authorizing           reimbursement of all, part or none of the ticketed amount  before  funding approval           can be finalized and payment issued (See NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations of           Authority,  Travel #12 ).                                                            NIH"

The President asked Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.   The Office of Personnel Management Welfare to Work web pages provide guidance regarding hiring authorities available for use in the efforts of Executive Departments and Agencies to provide employment opportunities for welfare recipients.    In his March 8, 1997, memorandum, President Clinton identified the  Worker-Trainee Program  as an option agencies can use to hire people off the welfare rolls.  To provide you with updated information on this program, we have included a description of the  programs background  as well as specifics relating to  current appointment provisions .    In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, federal agencies have many additional hiring options to consider.  Among them are permanent, temporary and term appointments in the  competitive service , as well as numerous  excepted service authorities .  These excepted service authorities include many that are agency-specific, and a number that are government-wide authorities.  These web pages describe the government-wide authorities most likely to be used for the Welfare to Work program.  In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, there may be a number of welfare recipients who qualify for the appointment options requiring additional experience, education and/or military service.

Student interns are also encouraged to seek academic     credit for the internship experience with their college or university. This program also     provides permanent state employees an opportunity for new or enriched work experiences in a setting     different than their permanent job. Undergraduate Internships    are three to six     months in duration and Executive Fellowships    are one to two years in     duration.       The Governor's Internship Program strives to attract, develop, and ultimately, retain     highly capable program participants as state employees. Successful candidates who compete     for positions are individuals dedicated to excellence and are interested in     public service.        By attracting bright, talented and highly motivated students and state employees,     sponsoring agencies will gain valuable assistance and innovation from selected interns.     Program participants will receive work experience, hands-on training, and the opportunity     to observe the various roles and duties within state government. Participants are expected     to leave the program as competent, prepared, and experienced public sector employees whose     skills and talents can lead to a career in state government.          Please     use the links on the left side of this page to find out more about the program,     qualifications for internship candidates, and how to apply.

The President asked Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.   The Office of Personnel Management Welfare to Work web pages provide guidance regarding hiring authorities available for use in the efforts of Executive Departments and Agencies to provide employment opportunities for welfare recipients.    In his March 8, 1997, memorandum, President Clinton identified the  Worker-Trainee Program  as an option agencies can use to hire people off the welfare rolls.  To provide you with updated information on this program, we have included a description of the  programs background  as well as specifics relating to  current appointment provisions .    In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, federal agencies have many additional hiring options to consider.  Among them are permanent, temporary and term appointments in the  competitive service , as well as numerous  excepted service authorities .  These excepted service authorities include many that are agency-specific, and a number that are government-wide authorities.  These web pages describe the government-wide authorities most likely to be used for the Welfare to Work program.  In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, there may be a number of welfare recipients who qualify for the appointment options requiring additional experience, education and/or military service.    We will be happy to assist agencies in developing your recruitment strategies.  Call the Staffing Reinvention Office at 202-606-0830 or send an email inquiry to  <w2w@opm.gov> .

I need  demographic and statistical data  by school district, county, and statewide.   Where can I get the data from the  1990 & 2000 Census ?     When will the  2000 Census data be released ?   What are the  current population estimates  for areas in California?   As a community college, I need  employment outlook data by Taxonomy of Programs  (TOP) code.   I am completing a grant application.  How do I determine if I am within a "" Labor Surplus Area ""?   Where can I find a list of the  companies which are planning layoffs  in my area?  I'm investigating the feasibility of developing targeted training programs for these workers.                  Guiding Students in Career Exploration                 Where to find general information about occupations such as descriptions, requirements, working conditions?     The  California Occupational Guides  are simple information sheets covering 300 individual occupations or groups of related occupations.  They provide statewide information about job duties, working conditions, employment outlook, wages, benefits, entrance requirements, and training.    Other general resources include  America's Career InfoNet .  The "" Career Opportunities Reports "" were developed to aid students and career professionals in the exploration of career opportunities in five industries:  Health Services; Arts, Media, and Entertainment; Hospitality, Tourism and Recreation; Information Technology; and Manufacturing.     You can also find general occupational data for selected occupations in the  Occupational Outlook Report  for your area.  These reports include data on wages, benefits, skills, education, training and experience requirements, worker supply and demand assessment, advancement potential, occupational projections, employment trends, and recruitment.     On  WorkSmart ,  students will find information on 50 entry-level occupations, as well as other  tips on getting ready for the world of work.   (WorkSmart   Fact Sheet )         How much does this job pay?     Wage data are collected by area as part of the  Occupational Employment Statistics  survey.  The information includes employment by occupation so you can find out the largest occupations and hourly and annual wages.  Look for your county, then find your job title.   You can also find wage data for selected occupations in the  Occupational Outlook Report  for your area.  In addition to wages, these reports include benefits, skills, education, training and experience requirements, worker supply and demand assessment, advancement potential, occupational projections, employment trends, and recruitment.  The wages from all Occupational Outlook Reports are also published separately as the  Directory of California Local Area Wages .          What jobs will be in demand in the future?     Estimates of future outlook or demand, also called employment projections by occupation, can give you an idea of what jobs  will be in high demand in the future.   You may want to plan training programs for those jobs.  Data on  outlook is available by occupation and county .           What kinds of businesses hire selected occupations?     To find out what types of businesses employ a particular occupation, go to "" California Industry-Occupational Staffing Patterns "".  There you can easily search for an occupation to see the industries that hire that occupation.  Students can use this information and their local Yellow Pages to find individual employers where they might want to apply for openings.           What jobs require similar skills?     Students need to realize that there are many jobs that may share a particular interest or skill.   Using  O*NET OnLine  to find occupations that have similar skills sets can expand their career investigations into areas that they hadn't explored.          Who offers training or apprenticeships to get a better job?   If your students are interested in trade or crafts occupations, they should check out the  California Apprenticeship Programs  website for the apprenticeships available in their area.         What benefits are employers providing?     Benefits are just part of the information available in the  Occupational Outlook Reports .  In addition to benefits, these reports include wages, skills, education, training and experience requirements, worker supply and demand assessment, advancement potential, occupational projections, employment trends, and recruitment.           Where to go to get a license or certificate.     Many different state agencies issue licenses or certificates depending upon the occupation involved.  The  California Professional & Business License Handbook   can help you  find the proper agency, the requirements and costs for the license.                     Finding & Getting a Job              Are job openings available on the Internet?     Yes, there are several job openings systems online.  EDD participates in two systems -  CalJOBS  (specifically for openings in California) and  America's Job Bank  (openings throughout the United States).      America's Jobline  is an audio version of AJB for job seekers available on the telephone 24 hours a day to provide all job announcements in a high-quality synthetic speech format instead of printed text.  Dial Jobline's toll-free number (1-800-414-5748) and follow the voice prompts to set up a personalized account.        Where can students find help preparing resumes and job applications?     There are many online resources to help you write your resume.  Go to  WorkSmart  and click on ""Tips for Success"" (WorkSmart   Fact Sheet )  or  America's Career InfoNet .  Students can also place their resume information on   CalJOBS  so that employers can see their information when searching for prospective workers.           How should jobseekers dress for their interview?     Go to  WorkSmart  for tips and suggestions on how to dress for your interview.  In addition, WorkSmart has information about how to get yourself ""job ready"".  (WorkSmart   Fact Sheet )                  Resources for Planning                 I need demographic and statistical data by school district, county, and statewide.     The Educational Demographics Office of the  California Department of Education  collects and publishes data from school districts statewide.  There are several resources on their website including DataQuest and the California Basic Educational Data System (CBEDS).  Some of the data available are API, enrollment, graduates, dropouts, course enrollments, staffing, English Learners, and Stanford 9 test data.          Where can I get the data from the 2000 Census?     As the data from the new 2000 Census become available, they will be released on the  US Census Bureau website .  A great tool to get data by county or city is the ""American Factfinder"" at  http://factfinder.census.gov/ .         When will the 2000 Census data be released?     The  schedule of release  for the data and products from the 2000 Census is available on the US Census Bureau website.         What are the current population estimates for areas in California?     Population estimates for the state, counties, and cities in California are generated by the Demographic Research Unit of the California Department of Finance.  Their estimates are available on their  website .         As a community college, I need employment outlook data by Taxonomy of Programs (TOP) code.     Under a contract with the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office, the Labor Market Information Division of the EDD tabulates its projections of employment by occupation into the TOP code structure.  These tabulations are available as Excel spreadsheets at  http://www.calmis.ca.gov/htmlfile/programs/coccc/Intro.htm          I am completing a grant application.  How do I determine if I am within a ""Labor Surplus Area""?     The "" Labor Surplus Area List "" is issued by the  U.S. Department of Labor.  The List, formerly published in the ""Area Trends"" report, is online at  http://www.uses.doleta.gov/lsa.asp .         Where can I find a list of the companies which are planning layoffs in my area?  I'm investigating the feasibility of developing targeted training programs for these workers.     The Employment Development Department maintains a list of companies who have reported upcoming layoffs.  This list is on-line at  http://www.edd.ca.gov/eddwarn.htm#ListingofWARNNotices .  This list is maintained in response to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act.  For more information on providing retraining services to workers involved in layoffs, contact the local  Workforce Investment Area  agency in your area.

STRATEGIES FOR AN EFFECTIVE JOB SEARCH OBJECTIVES The lessons in this chapter prepare you to:  Set personal goals  Get organized  Plan an effective job search  Analyze job announcements and ads for critical information to better match your qualifications with the employers' needs  Fill out job application forms and take employment tests  Understand how to research potential employers  Write effective resumes  Translate military experience into job skills  Write effective cover letters 37  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  3.1 SET GOALS What to Do On the next page you will identify specific jobs you are interested in researching and pursuing. Once you know more about a particular field or you want to explore career options, use the form on the following page to help you explore your options. Step 1: Identify jobs that interest you and write the titles on the following page. Step 2: Find out the salary range and necessary skills. Compare these to your financial needs and transferable skills. Step 3: Identify the training experience you need to qualify for the positions you find interesting. Step 4: Include your family members in your decisions.  38  So many of our dreams at first seem impossible. And then they seem improbable. And then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable. (Christopher Reeve)  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3.

Job Search Strategies  What to Know Now that you have done a personal appraisal and some career exploration, you need to make some career decisions to provide direction for your job search. You need to establish realistic goals, then figure out the best way to achieve them. There are three types of goals:  Short-range (6 months to 1 year)  Intermediate-range (1 to 5 years)  Long-range (5 to 10 years) You may need to make realistic career goals for each time range. What you want to be doing in five years may not be feasible now, but you can work toward that goal. You may need to find a short-term, stopgap job before you can obtain the appropriate, long-term position you really want. You may need to obtain a position or training in the short-term in order to qualify for the long-term position you would like to pursue. You need to have some consistency between your short-term and long-term goals. Each job along the way should be a step toward your long-term goal. You have already started the process of personal appraisal. This is an important step in goal setting. You might also want to refer to your individual transition plan from preseparation counseling.  40  What to Do It is difficult to make decisions about which goals to pursue if you do not know what your goals are or how you want your career to progress. Your goals must be SMART: Specific Measurable Adaptable Realistic Trackable 1. Specific If your goal is not specific you may not have a firm idea of how to get that job. EXAMPLE: I want a good paying, daytime job so I can continue my education.  This job goal is not specific enough to suggest where to start looking for this kind of employment. Your job search will not be focused. You may find a job, but it will probably not be the most appropriate one. EXAMPLE: I want a job in warehousing because I already have military experience doing this  type of work. It needs to be part-time and at night so I can use my military education fund to attend school during the day which will enable me to change my career. The position must pay at least $7.00 per hour and have a minimum of pressure so I can concentrate on my studies.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  This employment goal is specific enough to suggest where to start looking for this kind of employment. 2. Measurable Make a realistic, daily/weekly time table. This allows you to measure whether or not you are consistent in your employment search efforts. EXAMPLE: I will contact 3 employers per day on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. On  Monday and Friday, I will answer newspaper ads and send resumes. Setting up a time table avoids procrastination. 3. Adaptable Setting an employment goal is like using a road map with optional routes. If your search is not getting results, try an alternative route to your destination. EXAMPLE: I have been looking for a $9.00 per hour, part-time, evening warehouse job so I can go to school during the daytime.  I have not had any results. I will begin looking for a $8.00 per hour, daytime warehouse job and will go to school during the evening. Change your search method if it is not working. If your search method is working stick with it. Remember: You can stick with your employment search method but change your employment preference, the wage you want, or the hours you will be available to work. 4. Realistic Make sure your employment goals are realistic for your personal needs, the local economy and the job market. Your goals may be appropriate for your current needs, but not realistic for the current economic situation. You may have to settle for a position with less pay, less benefits and less advancement because the position you need and want is not available in your local employment market. You may have to consider other work until you can move to an area that has the employment opportunities you want and need. 5. Trackable You need to be able to trace your steps in your search for appropriate employment. Keeping track of where you go, with whom you speak and the results of each contact is extremely important. If your search is not getting results, you need to be able to look specifically at your efforts in order to see if there is some element that is missing or needs to be added. You cannot improve what you cannot track. Now that we have demonstrated the SMART technique, write your own short-, intermediate- and long-range goals. Make them employment related. It is easiest to start with long-range goals and work backwards to short-range goals.  41  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  3.2 GET ORGANIZED Schedule Your Time Think of looking for a job as a job. It requires planning and follow-through. At the beginning of each week, prepare a schedule with blocks of time for each type of activity (phone calls, reading ads, writing letters, etc.). Then, as the week progresses, make changes to allow time for interviews. Below is an example of a weekly schedule. NOTE: Set time aside to enjoy your family and friends, and relax. The sample schedule below shows Friday afternoon and Saturday as time off. The advantage of a schedule is it allows you to plan and use your time most effectively. It helps you avoid saying things like: ""I really wanted to, but...""; I just couldn't find the time...""; or ""I wish I had...."" At the beginning of each week, plan for each type of activity. Then, when an employer gives you a time for an interview, you can rearrange your schedule to use your time efficiently. Looking for a work is a full-time job. Keep good records. Use office software to organize company and interview notes, schedules, resumes, etc. Get a calendar and keep it current. Your time is valuable and there is much to be done in finding the right job for you. Schedule carefully, balancing your needs. The Company Information Record and Job Search Log further in this section will help you record your job search efforts and your progress in pursuing specific jobs. Be sure to prioritize your time. Some tasks are more important than others. The method you use to keep track of your job search is not important, but keeping track of it is very important!

Job Search Strategies  3.3 APPROACH THE JOB SEARCH PROCESS What to Know Finding a job is hard work. It is a job in itself. You should treat it just like a job, and use every resource available, including friends, acquaintances, relatives, teachers and professors. When you speak with these contacts, ask them about where they work. Job Search Methods Check with:  Your transition office  State Employment Services  Private employment agencies  Internet  School placement offices  Civil Service Administration (for testing)  Union hiring hall  Chambers of commerce  Employers  Answer ads in:  Local, state, national newspapers  Professional or trade journals Apply directly:  Job fairs  Private Industry Council  Employers Contact local organizations 43  Hidden Job Market The hidden job market simply refers to the fact that most jobs are not advertised. Eighty percent of all positions are filled without employer advertising. These positions are filled by, or created for, candidates who come to an employer's attention through recommendations from employees, referrals from trusted associates, recruiters, or direct contact with the candidate. Effective networking--using your contacts to connect with the employer's contacts--is the key to the hidden job market. You need to become skilled at finding the hidden job market in order to have access to as many jobs as possible. Employers are constantly on the lookout for suitable candidates to replace departing, retiring, or inefficient workers; to work on new projects or to add expertise in a particular area. Employers often have an immediate need to fill a position (someone resigns, a contract is awarded, etc.). Employers review resumes on hand or interview a prospective employee before advertising. Making these connections requires diligence and hard work.  People who wait for all conditions to be perfect before acting, never act.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

Show enthusiasm but do not be a pest.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  Networking Getting people involved in your search is called networking. It means using personal contacts to get information about job leads and contacts. Regardless of the type of job you are looking for, building a network will help you tap into the hidden job market. You never know where the best job lead will come from. The figure below will help you to consider those people you should involve in your effort to find work. Start building your network by making a list of all the people you know. Do not limit the list to people who know the work you do. The people on this list are your primary contacts. They do not have to be people who know about possible job leads, they just might be people who know other people that have knowledge of job leads, occupational information, specific employer contacts, etc. Before you begin contacting the people on your list, decide what type of information you want from the contact. You may be looking for:  information about a particular company, industry or line of work;  a referral to someone who might be able to help you; or  advice on conducting your job search. In many cases, you will want to ask to set up a brief meeting with the person. It is not a job interview. . . but it may bring you a job lead. Always have plenty of resumes available. If you feel awkward or embarrassed contacting people to ask for something, remember:  most people like helping other people;  many people have been in your shoes and remember how hard it was; and  some people will have a job opening, or know of one, and feel that fate brought you to them! Begin your networking by calling the people on your list you can talk to most easily and work up to making the calls that are more stressful. You may have to force yourself to make the first few calls, but it does get easier with each call! 45  fellow military personnel supervisor spouse former employers former co-workers  parents of children's friends  close friends/ colleagues  friends of friends  YOU military transition office immediate family  relatives teachers acquaintances  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  3.4 RESEARCH COMPANIES What to Know One of the most critical elements but least used job search ""tools"" is researching companies. Most applicants think it is difficult to get information, or simply fail to see the value of the effort. Research is a good idea because: 1. You may get to know someone in the organization, and therefore have a personal contact. 2. If you have information about the company, you can do a better job of identifying transferable skills and matching those to the organization and the job. 3. You can ask questions in a job interview that are based on information few other applicants have. Researching a company can make you ""look better"" when compared to other candidates, because so few applicants do their homework. 46  What to Do The Internet is a critical element of successful job searching. Items you might want to research: company growth, city's average salaries for field, annual reports, cost of living. For example, if you wanted to find the ABC Company's annual report for last year, you'd go to a search engine and do a ""key word"" search by typing in ""ABC Company Annual Report."" The search engine will then generate a list of links to webpages that contain the key words you specified. The list of webpages is usually sorted by relevance, meaning that the ones at the top of the list are probably most closely related to what you're looking for. There are plenty of reference materials available in libraries to give you information on a company. You can do the research yourself or ask the librarian for help. A professional librarian is trained to find information from a variety of sources, or to direct you to other resources available in the community. Your local public library may also have a special Business Reference Section, which collects additional information on businesses in the local area. This information generally tends to be more current than annual publications. In any case, the Reference Desk at any library is a good starting point for your research. After you have done research, you may then call the company to get additional information. You should call to ask for information for two reasons. First, to request printed material about the organization such as an annual report or brochure. Second, try to speak with someone about the job you want. Refer to section 2.1, ""What to Say on the Phone.""  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  Practice The Company Information Record on the following page has space for information you might be able to find on a given company. Create and prioritize a list of companies that interest you in order to research them. As you research companies, keep a record of important information on the Company Information Record form. Use one page for each company. Keep this information organized and easily accessible. Copy one worksheet for each company you are researching. Refer to ""What to Say on the Phone"" in section 2.1. Things to research before contacting a company: 1. Number of employees;  2. What the company does (service and/or products);  3. Business volume, net worth, profit and loss, company stability, etc. (see company's annual report if available);  4. Company competitors;  47  5. Company history and future plans;  6. Company locations (headquarters, branch offices, international offices, retail outlets, etc.);  7. Salary range or hourly rates paid for various positions;  8. Contact names (department heads, human resource manager, people you know who work there, former employees, etc.);  9. Employment activity (recent hiring, firing, layoffs, etc.); and  10. Titles of positions that interest you.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

Job Search Strategies  3.5 JOB SEARCH ASSISTANCE What to Know One of the first steps in finding a job is to identify where you can get job information and help. Where you go will depend on the type of job you want, where you want to live and work, and the available jobs in your field. Some sources of job information are: 1. Internet There is information available for virtually all interests: graduate or professional schooling, full or part-time employment, internships, company profiles, summer jobs, or relocation assistance. The number of webpages available grows daily. Another advantage of the Internet is that you can access current information at all hours of the day or night. You can access information about your local area as well as take your search far beyond your regular boundaries. This is especially helpful if you want to relocate to another area. Another advantage is that using the Internet in your search demonstrates your leading-edge skills to potential employers. Not only do you know how to use a computer but you also know how to navigate online. The Internet can help you explore career alternatives and options that you maybe haven't considered. You can find some self-assessment tools online, and loads of occupations and disciplines to explore. No one website will meet all of your needs. The transition website has many useful links to a variety of job search related sources. 2. State Workforce Agency (Employment Office) Assistance in finding jobs is offered to veterans at State Workforce Agency (SWA) offices throughout the country. The local SWA offers services both to job-seekers and employers at no charge. Although the SWA provides assistance to everyone looking for a job, veterans are given priority. The SWA staff will evaluate your interests, skills, aptitudes and abilities and match them with employers' job requirements. Qualified applicants are referred to employers for job interviews. Qualified veterans are referred to employers ahead of non-veterans. Call the number listed in your telephone book under ""State Government."" 3. Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP) staff and Local Veterans Employment Representatives (LVER) Primarily located in the offices of the State Workforce Agency employment offices, these staff provide assistance exclusively to veterans. They directly provide or facilitate the provision of labor exchange services, including assessment, counseling, testing, job-search assistance, referral and placement. 4. Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment is and employment-oriented program that assists veterans with service-connected disabilities by offering them services and assistance to help them prepare for, find and keep employment. 5. Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT), U.S. Department of Labor Apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and related classroom instruction in which workers learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM  50   3. Job Search Strategies  highly-skilled occupation. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by joint employer and labor groups, individual employers, and/or employer associations. The BAT gives priority to veterans to help them gain entry into apprenticeship programs. All programs registered with BAT are recognized by State Apprenticeship Councils and meet VA regulations for training programs, which makes enrolled veterans eligible for VA educational assistance allowances. For further information; write the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer and Labor Services, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave, NW, Washington, D.C., 20210. You may also contact your nearest BAT Regional Office (look in the blue pages of your phone book). 6. Private Employment Services Private employment agencies are not all the same. They are regulated by each state Department of Labor, licensing bureau. States regulate the percentage agencies are allowed to charge. The applicant (you) might have to pay for the agency to market you to local employers. They will counsel on how to dress, prepare your resume, interviewing assistance; but, will not get the job for you. Most employment agencies do not charge for their services.Employment agencies can also be employer fee paid. This means the employer will pay the hiring fee. Other possibilities might be the fee would be split between you and the employer, or the employer might make an agreement to reimburse the fee once you have completed a probation period. Carefully read any contract you sign, and understand the terms. Get a copy for your records. Career counselors are not employment agencies. Their function is to assist you in creating or upgrading a resume, dressing for success and interviewing skills. Career counselors usually charge a flat fee from $500.00 to $3,000.00. They do not arrange interviews for you, they point you in the right direction. Sometimes there are additional charges for extra services. Be sure anyone you use has good credentials. Ask to see and check their references. Headhunters are people hired by organizations to locate specific types of people. They are paid by the company. Most often headhunters will not work with people who are looking for salaries less than $40,000.00 and this number fluctuates depending on industry and geographic location. Don't expect a headhunter to burn up the phone lines trying to find you a job. Temporary services put you on their payroll. As their employee, you are then sent out ""on assignment"" to other employers. You are paid by the temporary service, not by the company in whose office or plant you are working. Most temporary services do not have any benefits for their employees. Many temporary services will offer you training free of charge to update or to expand your skills. Many will allow you to come into the office on your own time and learn computer software. It makes you more marketable. There is usually no fee charged at a temporary service.  51  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  7. College/School Placement Agencies Most institutions of higher education provide some kind of placement service, but this service is usually only available to students and alumni of the school. Some school/college placement agencies also provide instruction in job-hunting skills. 8. Military and Professional Associations and Organizations Military and professional associations are useful for specialized occupations. They can provide information on areas where the demand for a particular occupation is higher, as well as information on employers hiring individuals in a particular field. Some of the organizations even provide specific job search and career instruction assistance. 9. Telephone Directory Yellow Pages, Industry Directory These are useful sources of information if you already know the type of job you want. These sources provide lists of companies employing individuals in various types of jobs. 10. Industrial and Craft Unions Industrial and craft unions tend to deal with a limited number of occupations. They are advantageous because they have exclusive hiring authority for some firms. If you have appropriate skills and/or aptitude and interests, this could be of value to you. 52 11. Job Fairs A useful tool in meeting employers and delivering resumes is attendance at job fairs. Contact either your transition office, local chambers of commerce, and other business organizations which provide services to the community or further information about these events. 12. Transition Offices Transition offices provide individual assessment, classes and workshops, and leadership consultation. Primary transition office programs and transition assistance from military service include relocation, financial management and aid, information and referral, family readiness, and family life skills. 13. Chambers of Commerce Chambers of commerce offer rich resources about the businesses in their area and offer contact information for many of them. Their services are usually free for job-searchers. Publications are available, but only list member companies. Some have meetings that are open to the public.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  3.6 JOB SEARCH ONLINE What to Know Searching for jobs online is becoming increasingly significant in the job search process. There are some occupations that lend themselves to this process more than others. You first must first determine what job search sites would be best for you to find the particular occupations that interest you. Some sites specialize in certain types of jobs. Use the resources provided by your transition office and the transition website to research these. With thousands of job sites online, advertising millions of jobs, where do you begin? It can get confusing and frustrating if you don't know where to look. To practice, begin with a large, popular site, such as Americas Job Bank (AJB).  What to Do Once you get into the site, it will ask you several questions. First, in which state and locations you are willing to work. Identify these, then look under job families, which are broken down into many different job fields, depending on the site, and then individual job titles under each one. When typing in keywords, it is important to try and keep your search as broad as possible in the beginning. Once you have identified a variety of job titles, try and narrow it down. For example, if you wanted to be a ""camera operator for television,"" but do not have the experience to obtain that job right now, type in the word ""television."" This will give you a deeper variety of job titles relating to jobs that may help you work up to the position you ultimately want. For example, a ""camera utility"" worker is a job title that is more entry level than television camera person. Type in a variety of keywords separated by commas to get an even broader perspective. Understand that how you type in keywords will dictate your results, because ""construction, project manager"" will give you an entirely different list of jobs than ""construction project manager."" As you look at specific titles that interest you, it will narrow your search. Employers often list jobs in a wide variety of titles for the same occupation. Finding these jobs is part of the challenge. If you stay with just one job title, you may miss out on a variety of jobs in related areas. In AJB, if you are looking for a construction project manager position, you might look in occupation fields such as management and engineer rather than construction. You need to understand how each site is organized, as each is different. Experimentation is important in locating all of the jobs that interest you. Look at both the big sites and also the specialty sites catering to the specific occupations that interest you. There are job search engines that provide extensive lists of job sites. When you identify a job opening, try and research the company to find out all you can about the company and the job. You can also go directly to specific company web sites to locate job openings they may have and apply for them online.  53  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  Applying for Jobs Online There are several ways to submit your resume online. One of them is posting your resume on a job search career site. Posting Your Resume on a Job Search Career Site There are countless job search career sites on the web. Each is unique in its own way, but for the most part, similar in many respects of creating a resume on their site. Sites such as America's Job Bank have a way for you to register on their site and post your resume, hoping employers will utilize these career sites to recruit you as a potential employee.  Most of these online resume builders are simple and straightforward. They give you a step-by-step, fill-in-the-blank process that is easy to follow. More than likely they require you to register on their site, which is usually free. Some of these sites are good and some are not so great in terms of resume format, so be selective.  With each fill-in-the-blank space, you must carefully edit and proofread your documents. Spell check is usually not provided by the site. To spell check the document yourself, save the resume to your computer, spell check the document in your word processing program, then go back to the online document and make corrections.  The objective is what the employer will usually use to screen applications. If interested, they will open the entire resume to review. Therefore, be sure that your objective is simple and clearly stated. A mistake many job seekers make is trying to sell your skills here by making their objective statement too long.  Posting your resume on a website may not be the most effective way to get a job. The main reasons why this technique does not work are that individuals do not target their search or that the resume is poorly written. The best resumes are targeted resumes, and posting a resume on a web site does not allow for the most effective targeting.  54  Wealth comes to those who make things happen, not to those who let things happen.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   Job Search Strategies  3. Job Search Strategies  3.7 ANALYZE WANT ADS In addition to using online search techniques, reviewing want ads in the classified section of newspapers and specific industry publications is also helpful. A small percentage of job-seekers find employment by responding to want ads. While want ads are not the only way to find a job, looking through want ads can give you a good idea of the availability of jobs in certain industries. You may be able to find out what kind of experience, qualifications, salary and skills are needed for certain jobs. If certain jobs do not appear in the want ads, it does not necessarily mean that there are no job openings in that field. Most new ads are published Wednesdays and Sundays, so pay attention to these days. Read the want ads cover to cover, because jobs that interest you may be listed in unexpected places. For example, want ads for drywallers might be listed under construction, painters, laborers, home builders, carpenters, etc. When reading and responding to want ads be aware of the following:  Some ads do not give a company name, you reply to a P.O. box, making it impossible to do any research on the company.  Ads that promise a big paycheck with little experience required usually indicate sales positions that work on commission.  If the contact for the ad is an employment agency, find out if they will charge you a fee. Some agencies charge the employer a fee, some charge the job-seeker a fee.  Multiple position ads usually indicate a new or expanding company. Competition is often fierce for these positions.  Some ads use the word ""preferred"" (degree preferred, two years experience preferred, etc.). This usually means you can apply if you do not have that particular skill or ability as long as you have the other qualifications.  When sending a resume in response to a want ad make sure you meet the minimum requirements. If the ad says certification, license, degree, experience, etc. required, you might be wasting your time if you do not have those qualifications. If it says ""no phone calls,"" do not call. 55  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  3.8 COMPLETE APPLIC ATION FORMS What to Know Using the Master Application Worksheet (refer to section 1.2, Create a Career Catalog) makes filling out application forms much easier. Almost every employer will require you to fill out an application form, even though the company may already have your resume and cover letter. Applications may be used to make the first ""cut"" in screening applicants for interviews. The form may be a test to see how well you follow directions. It is always a good idea to take your time and do it well. When possible get two copies of the form. Use one as a draft copy before completing the final form.  What to Do Use the following suggestions to complete application forms: 1. Be prepared when you fill out the form. 2. Read and follow all directions before beginning to fill out the form. 56 3. Make your application neat and easy to read--it will be judged on appearance and content. If possible, type the form. If you can't type the form, print neatly. 4. Do not write ""see resume,"" even if the application repeats information. 5. Read each question and decide how you will answer before you begin to write. This will help you fit the answer into the available space, as well as write the best answer. 6. Answer all questions. If a question does not apply or you feel the question invades your privacy, write N/A for ""not applicable."" Do not leave blank spaces. 7. Do not scratch out or write over mistakes. If you must correct over a mistake, cross out the error completely with a single line (--). 8. Take your time, but work steadily. If you take too long filling out an application at the company, the employer may think you are not prepared. 9. Answer questions honestly--never lie, and do not use sarcastic answers. 10. Ask questions if you do not understand something about the form. 11. After you complete the form, check it for accuracy, correct grammar, and spelling. Make sure it is neat, and make a copy for your records.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  12. Follow up on the application at regular intervals (about every week) until you hear from the employer. 13. Work Experience: Make sure you have all the information you will need with you. Work on describing your duties before you fill out an application, so you can be brief and clear in your descriptions. If you prefer not to give your salary history, write ""will discuss in interview"" in the space provided. However, keep in mind some employers will screen you out. When giving your reason for leaving, never give a negative answer. ""I completed my military goal,"" ""moved,"" and ""seasonal,"" are all very acceptable answers. Do not write ""fired."" If you were fired, write ""will discuss in interview."" 14. Position Desired: Always fill in this space! Never write ""any"" or ""will do anything!"" Do some research first so you know what jobs you qualify for and are available in the company. 15. Salary Desired: Before filling out an application, be sure you know the salary you would accept and the wage range for the position you want. few companies in the area and ask the pay range for the type of job for you are applying. It is okay to write ""open"" or ""negotiable"" rather than a figure on the application to identify the salary. lowest Call a which putting  16. Availability: Unless you cannot start a job right away, write ""immediately"" in this space. Otherwise, write the date you will be available to start work. If asked what hours or shifts you will work, write ""open"" unless you have specific requirements. 17. Special Skills, Abilities and Training: You are often asked to list any special skills, abilities, experiences and/or training you have that relates to the position you want. This is an opportunity for you to highlight anything that may possibly set you apart from other applicants.  57  Your Right to Privacy According to the Personal Privacy Act it is inappropriate for employers to request certain information on application forms. If you encounter a job application that requests this information, it is your decision whether or not to supply it. If you choose not to answer these types of questions make sure you write N/A (for Not Applicable) to indicate you have seen the question. Some examples of inappropriate questions include: date of birth, marital status, dependents, health, citizenship, and social or religious affiliations.  I am not afraid of tomorrow, for I have seen yesterday and I love today. (William Allen White)  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

As a veteran, you may have an advantage applying for work with the federal government. Not only do certain veterans get extra points for veteran status in the selection process, but they also receive credit for their time in the military toward federal years of service for seniority and retirement. Keep in mind that there may be an application/employment waiting period for some veterans. Retirees have different rules which apply to them. Check the Transition website for the most current information. By law, qualified veterans with a service-connected disability or who served on active duty in the United States Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in military campaigns may be entitled to preference over non-veterans both in federal civil service hiring and/or in retention during reductions in force. 58  Federal Application Procedure In the past, the United States Federal Government required job applicants to submit a standardized application form known as the SF-171. Today you can apply for most federal jobs with a resume or an optional application (OF-612). The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is the government's hiring authority, now accepts resumes. Check the job posting/announcement to see which format and method of delivery they prefer. Even if you submit a general application form, you may also be required to submit additional information targeted for each position--for example: OF-612, computer scan forms, etc. However, the resume will be considered the primary application. If an applicant simply submits a regular resume they will never be referred and never qualify for any federal position. Resumes must be targeted and be completely tailored to the position. Federal resumes could be several pages in length as opposed to the preferred one page by private sector employers. Be sure to read the job announcement carefully to see all of the requirements for submitting an application. There is computer software available at most Transition Offices which will enable you to use electronic versions of Federal Employment forms and/or help you with your resume or application.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  What A Resume For Federal Employment Must Contain Read the job announcement carefully.

Job Search Strategies  Filling Out the Optional Application for Federal Employment -- OF-612 Transition offices may offer assistance in completing a federal application and in composing resumes for Federal employment. Here are some tips for filling out the OF-612 and the additional knowledge, skills and abilities narratives required in most case-examining job announcements. An example of the expanded format which may be used in preparing the work experience blocks follows the tip section. 1. Plan carefully. Your OF-612 is the first thing a prospective employer sees; apply the concept you are preparing ""an interview on paper."" 2. Prepare your basic or ""master"" OF-612 after reviewing the X-118 Handbook and some current announcements in your field. The X-118 is a qualifications information source which is available in most CPOs and transition centers or libraries. For Wage Grade or Blue Collar information, use the X-118 C. 3. The announcement may detail Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) which must be documented on plain paper. 4. Prepare a separate narrative on each ""selective"" or ""quality ranking"" or KSA factor as stated in the job announcement. This could make the difference in whether or not you are considered for the position. A typed supplemental statement relating your experience to these factors helps avoid having to tailor your OF-612 each time you apply for different positions. Include concrete examples of work performed. The same information may need to be repeated to address multiple KSAs within the same application. 5. Block 8, ""Work Experience,"" is the most important part of your OF-612. Neglecting to provide complete information for jobs similar to the one sought could cause you to be disqualified for the positions. Start each section of Item 8 with duties, which are what you do for your employer; list all key duties, including those not listed in your position description. 6. Follow the brief Duties narrative with a series of ""bullet"" entries which are concrete examples of WHAT you did, HOW OFTEN, HOW MUCH money or HOW MANY units of activities were produced, WHO you dealt with inside and outside the organization, and WHY the activity was done-- i.e., how your product was used by others. Work from most important to least important examples. 7. Next, which those major in each section include accomplishments, which are things you did were above and beyond what is normally expected of you; describe accomplishments which represent your highest skills. You may indicate accomplishments after each work experience block. 63  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  8. Start with your most recent job which is similar to the work sought. YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO GO BACK 10 YEARS. Other work experience may either be summarized in one additional block, or you may continue to add new blocks as far back as needed. 9. Work performed as a volunteer may also be used to demonstrate your qualifications for a position. Remember to include volunteer or unpaid work experience that is related to the position for which you are applying. 10. A key item to provide on your OF-612 is evidence that you have progressed in each job, as well as from one job to the next. Clearly describe how you have assumed more responsibilities or more demanding duties with each job. 11. Use separate experience blocks for each employer, promotion, substantial salary change, job reassignment, or detail. 12. In Item 2, fill in the lowest grade level shown on the announcement you will accept. If qualified, you may be considered for grade levels above the level you indicated. 13. In Item 12, list degrees you expect to receive within nine months of the date of your application. Education may be substituted for experience, but experience is the major factor for most evaluations. 64 14. In Item 13, indicate any special qualifications, skills, and accomplishments: memberships, publications, presentations, letters of commendation, certificates, nominations, honors, awards, etc. Do not attach copies unless instructed to do so. 15. After you complete your OF-612, save the original. You will probably be able to use it for other, similar jobs. Photocopies are acceptable, but each copy must be signed and dated in ink. Fill in the job for which you are applying (Item 1), and the vacancy announcement number (Item 3), and the signature and date (Item 18) at the time of application. 16. You may be able to claim 5-point veteran preference/direct appointment authorities, if entitled to it, on Item 15 of the OF-612, BEFORE RECEIVING YOUR DD Form 214. This has been established in an OPM directive to federal agencies. You must provide proof of preference in competitive examining prior to entry. You can not claim 10-point preference without the documentation noted on the Standard Form 15, Application for 10-Point Veteran Preference.  Transition offices offer assistance in completing a federal application and in composing resumes for federal employees.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  3.10 CREATE AN EFFECTIVE RESUME What to Know Many people think that a resume is only for white collar jobs. On the contrary, in our changing job market almost everyone will need a resume, including most blue collar workers. The resume is a selling tool that outlines your skills and experiences so an employer can see, at a glance, how you can contribute to the employer's workplace. More to the point, what we are actually doing is applying for an interview. Only in the rarest of cases will a resume in and of itself directly secure a job offer. The goal of an effective resume is to highlight and summarize a person's qualifications.  What to Do The first step in creating your resume is to determine which jobs you are both qualified for and interested in. In today's job market it is crucial to be as specific as possible. Your experience in the military has probably given you a wide variety of skills that you can apply in several career fields. Make a determination of what you want to do. To clarify your skills selection refer back to transferable skills, section 1.4. Use the statements you wrote to help you decide. Once you have identified the types of positions you want to pursue, you need to select the resume format that best introduces you to the job market. This is a marketing decision based on the message you want to send to a potential employer. Target your skills to fit the job you are applying for.  65  Many people think that a resume is only for white collar jobs. On the contrar y, in our changing job market almost ever yone will need a resume, including most blue collar workers.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   RESUME FORMATS--WHICH ONE IS BEST? 3.

Job Search Strategies  Translate Your Military Experience Into Civilian Terms As you create your resume, avoid military jargon and military terms. Most civilian employers will not understand military jargon, abbreviations and acronyms. Therefore, use the following guidelines to prevent this problem:  Write out terms and, when necessary, explain what they mean.  For specialized military training, list the names and number of hours of professional and technical training you have taken. Only include training if it relates to the job.  Briefly explain any course that may be pertinent to the job. For example, write, ""Management and Supervision"" as a course title. Then add the course content: equal opportunity law; giving and receiving positive and negative feedback; and giving directions.  Use civilian equivalent phrases and titles. Civilian recruiters will not take the time to translate your resume into civilian terms, and therefore may not see you as qualified for the position. Below are some military terms with recommended civilian equivalents. Military Terms Civilian Equivalent  NCOIC ......................................Supervisor, Manager, Coordinator TDY/TAD ..................................Business Related Travel PCS ............................................Relocation NCO Academy ..........................Leadership or Management Training War College ................................Executive Military Leadership School Command and Staff College ......Senior Military Leadership School Basic Officers Course ................Entry Level Officer Leadership Course Basic Training ............................Introductory Military Training O7 and above ..............................President, Senior Director, Chairman of the Board, Managing Director O5 and O6 ..................................Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Program Director O4................................................Senior Administrator, Department Head, Program Manager O1 to O3 ....................................Executive, Administrator, Manager, Project Officer WO1 to WO5 ............................Director, Specialist, Facilitator, Technical Manager, Technical Specialist E7 to E9 ......................................Director, Supervisor, Department Manager, Operations Manager, Senior Advisor E4 to E6 ......................................Assistant Manager, Line Supervisor, Section Leader, Task Leader, Supervisor, Foreman E1 to E3 ......................................Production Worker, Assembler, Technician, Assistant, Apprentice, Team Member PARTICIPANT MANUAL  67   3. Job Search Strategies  Follow These Resume Guidelines 1. Write  The  The  The your resume to show employers three things: amount and kind of responsibility you have handled. results you have achieved. relevancy of your past responsibilities and accomplishments.  2. List your achievements and how you solve problems, not simply your responsibilities. In other words, explain how you increased operational efficiency, the amount of money you saved or raised, the number of people who used the service or product, the action that came about as a result of your efforts, etc. Write these items in phrases that identify the problem, note the solution, and describe the result. 3. Use statistics or numbers when you can, to show the results of what you did (i.e., size of organization, number of people supervised, length of report, time involved, size of budget, amount of money raised, etc.). Identify types of people, services, products, and programs with which you worked. 4. Write your own resume. Seek all the advice you can, but since you'll be the one at the interview, you'll make the best author. If you decide to use a resume writing service, work closely with the writer to make sure that the resume reflects your experience and personality. 68 5. Keep your resume brief, clean and easy to read with lots of white space on the page. Use the minimum number of words to convey what you wish to say. Be able to defend every word. 6. Be specific about your job and accomplishments; leave nothing to the imagination. 7. Be selective in the information that you include in your resume. Choose only information that relates to the jobs you seek. 8. Include volunteer experience relevant to the position sought. Also, include data on travel, languages, hobbies, certificates, if relevant to the target job. 9. Match the style look that many matching bond of your resume. of your resume to the style of the company. Avoid the slick resume services offer. Print your resume and cover letter on paper (white, bone, or ivory). Do not print on the back side Use a standard typeface and black ink.  10. Avoid gimmicks. Be creative, but always professional. 11. If possible, keep an electronic copy of your resume so you can easily make changes. Check with your transition office, public library, State Workforce Agency employment office or community college career center to see if they have computers available that you can use. Alternatively, you can write your resume by hand and pay a service to type it and save it electronically.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  12. Be impressive in describing your experiences, but always be 100% honest. Never exaggerate or misrepresent yourself. 13. Make several drafts of your resume--boil it down to essential information and have it critiqued before it is copied. Recognize that you may need to write several different resumes in order to customize it for specific jobs. 14. Always send a cover letter to accompany your resume. 15. Do not include names of references on your resume. 16. Do not mention salary on your resume. 17. Keep everything positive in what you say about yourself--stress your strengths, not your weaknesses. 18. Use feedback from friends, relatives, and interviewers as to how your resume is coming across and modify where necessary. 19. Your resume should not be longer than two pages. One page is usually enough, especially if you have limited work experience. When mailing resumes, do not staple any documents together. 20. Include a Special Skills section where you can note languages you speak, read or write; computer hardware and software you can use; and machinery or equipment you can operate, build or repair. Do not use military terminology! 21. Emphasize credentials (licenses or certifications) obtained if they relate to the job that you are seeking. They can either be included in the ""Highlights of Qualifications"" section or in the ""Education and Training"" section. 22. Information you should not include on your resume:  marital status  names, ages, and number of children  spouse's job  age  race  photograph of yourself  religious and political affiliations  height and weight  salary for each previous job 23. Be Dynamic. Use the action verbs on page 74 to begin each sentence in your resume. Avoid using the phrase ""responsible for... ."" Most interviewers interpret that phrase to mean you did not complete the action yourself. It is recommended that you use present tense for current jobs and past tense for jobs you have previously held.  69  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  Resume Worksheet Building a good resume takes a lot of time and thought. You will not be able to do this quickly or in one sitting. Try to see it as a process taking one step at a time, so that it will not seem so overwhelming. You will discover just how well the time was spent when you have a good resume. As you prepare your resume for each application, make sure you know how the employer wants to receive it. Do they want it mailed via U.S. Postal Service? Do they want it e-mailed? Submitted online? If a resume is submitted in a form that does not meet their expectations, it may not even be considered. Once you feel the resume looks and reads well, have a professional review it for ease of reading, spelling and grammar. Make sure you use terminology that is common to the industry in which you are applying. Do not use military terms and acronyms. For example, do not make employers guess what a M1A1 Tank Crewman is and how that position relates to the job applied for. Your responsibility is to interpret for the employer the skills you have to match their needs. Format has to do with organization of information. This manual provides you with examples of how to organize the same information using the three resume format styles. Refer to the example resumes further along in this section to see which best fits you and the position you seek. 70 Name: Use your complete name, not a nickname, as it appears in your normal signature. Make certain it is complete and spell out Street, Avenue, etc. Make sure that it is a professional address i.e. MarySmith@email.com versus MaryLovesBubbleGum@email.com Include area codes and use numbers where you can be reached personally, by voice mail, or by a professional message on an answering machine. Never leave a number for a machine that has something ""cute"" or ""funny"" as a greeting.  Address: E-mail:  Phone:  Employment/Job Objective: The most effective, well-written job objective is a targeted job objective that is for a specific job (bookkeeper, medical transcriber, diesel mechanic, etc.) with a specific company (for General Motors, Johnston automotive, etc.). Since you may need a different resume for each opening you locate, you will also need to change the job objective and especially the specific company for each resume. Be sure that you know the actual title of the job when you apply. If you put down that you are seeking a position that is not open, then you may not be considered. For example, if a line position is open and you are asking for a management job, then you may never get the interview that you want. Your objective can also be repeated in the body of the cover letter. Make the objective short and to the point. Consider this the title of your resume. The rest of the resume must convince the hiring authority that you have the background and skills to do the job and are well worth an interview.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  Do not assume that any job objective is better than no objective. If your objective is vague and unfocused, you appear indecisive and unable to make decisions and set goals. This is not a description of duties or a vague description of a job. Avoid statements such as ""a position that will utilize my broad talents and allow me to grow."" If this is your objective, better to leave it off your resume. Using a job objective has been an optional issue on a resume in the past, but in recent years it has become more important. There are times when you absolutely need a job objective, such as:  When applying online. Often jobs are sorted by objectives and directed to the correct department for review.  When applying to large companies, to avoid the human resources department deciding the position you should fill.  Posting resumes on job search sites, such as America's Job Bank (AJB). Employers decide whether to review your resume based on the job objective.  Resumes for scanning. The objective becomes a key word in the screening process. Targeted Job Objective: When you know the name of the company, it is always good to mention it in the objective. Examples of Good Targeted Job Objectives  Seeking a position as a Licensed Vocational Nurse for St. Mary's Hospital  A position as a Bookkeeper for M&M tax consultants  Position as a Security Guard for Brinks International General Job Objective: Occasionally you do not know the actual company you are sending your resume to and a general job objective is most effective in these circumstances. When you do not know the name of the actual company or are going to a job fair and will hand out resumes to several companies, then the objective needs to be more generic. Often jobs that are posted on the Internet are blinds ads from head hunters and you will not be able to find the company name.  Entry level position in multi-image production company  Position as a Health Educator  Project management position in Marketing Summary of Qualifications: Write a summary that highlights your professional background as it relates to the needs of the company. This normally appears at the top of your resume and is intended to draw attention to specific personal qualities and skills you possess that make you a unique and qualified candidate. Hiring managers need to see immediately you have the skills and experience they need. If an employer has to figure out what you can do for him, the odds are you won't get an interview. Do not repeat the same statements used in your resume, but you may summarize some information. Your company research will be invaluable here to help you relate your qualifications to the needs of the company. This can be in the form of a paragraph or a short list, with 4-5 one line bullet statements. Remember a resume is a sales tool and this is a good place to catch someone's interest and to ""brag"" about your best qualities.  71  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3. Job Search Strategies  If, for example, you are applying for a position as an Administrative Assistant, you might want to list things such as:  Five years experience in customer service  Organized and efficient  Ability to relate detailed information to the overall project for improved customer service Some other examples include:  Over 15 years of diverse and challenging experience, combined with powerful presentation skills, a disciplined approach to the task at hand and the innate ability to anticipate potential obstacles are attributes that contribute to a strong record of excellence and acknowledgment for ""getting the job done.""  Over three years experience ordering and maintaining a complex four million dollar inventory of parts. Filled orders in a timely fashion with 100% accuracy. Skilled at operating inventory control software.  Five years experience in heavy equipment operation. Knowledgeable of related OSHA regulations with a perfect safety record. Experience in both commercial building and road construction.  Over 12 years of technical sales and marketing experience including:  electronic component sales  knowledge of Unix, Pascal, Sun work station, Fortran  new software business start-up and market presentation  international marketing penetration 72 Employment History: This portion of the resume is probably the most important.  Depending on the style you select, it will dictate where and how you will organize the information. To make this process easier to understand, there are several examples of each format in the TAP manual.  There are many books that provide example resumes. See the transition website for specific recommendations.  To begin exploring your employment history, write down everything you can about what you did in a specific job. Include:  skills  accomplishments  machines you can operate;  computer software you can run  improvements you suggested or made in a process or system.  Try to include specific and quantifiable data. Refer back to section 1.4 and look at the skill statements you made and incorporate them. Once you have written a paragraph or pages of information, find qualifications relating to the job you are seeking. If the job you are seeking is an entirely new field, but uses a lot of the specific skills from your past experience, consider putting information into categories. An example would be if you have been a Military Police Officer and want to go into private investigation, you could group bullet statements under categories such as investigation, case management, and security to create a combination resume. Or, if you were an electronics technician for the past four years in the military plus worked in the same field for two years prior to joining, and want to go into the same field of work, then you would write a chronological resume to show stability and progressive job responsibilities.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   3. Job Search Strategies  Quantify your Experience, Responsibilities and Accomplishments: The next step is the basics of every resume. List all results/achievements you have produced that relate to the position desired. Results sell, job descriptions don't! Refer back to the skills section and expand on these to use when writing your resume. Employers need to see accomplishments they can relate to with regard to the open position. The question that must be answered is, ""What is this individual going to do for me?"" Achievements that relate to the specific position will answer that question. Describe what you accomplished with numbers, percentages, etc. Explain how many times annually, what percentage of increase or decrease you produced, how large a group you supervised or trained, etc.:  Supervised 14 member staff to complete $5.4 million project three months ahead of estimated date.  Produced 150 percent of quota for eight consecutive months resulting in $400,000 additional savings for the department.  Administered travel budget of $15 million dollars.  Reduced inventory loss by 20 percent over six month time period resulting in first ever decrease in inventory loss.  Developed training program for a 600 person organization. Education: Make sure you include education that is relevant to the job you are applying and start with the most recent.  List colleges, trade schools, military training schools (if you are applying for a job as a security guard, then your specific firearms training would apply, but if you want to work as a supervisor in a pre-school, this would not fit), correspondence courses, etc.  List the location of the school but you do not need to include dates attended, especially if your knowledge of the technology is not current. Normally you do not list grades or specific classes; however, if you want a job where you have little experience and have a specific course that would directly relate, then you may want to point this out somewhere in the education section. If you have recently graduated and took classes at night while working full-time, then the fact you graduated Magna cum Laude might be important to some employers. Always relate the information on the resume to the job.  73  Resume writing takes a blend of creativity and skill. If you create a resume on a computer you can tailor it to the requirements of the different jobs you apply for.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

Job Search Strategies  Resume Writing The purpose of including accomplishment statements in a resume is to create a visual value statement in the mind of the reader. This statement a snapshot which enables the employer to SEE you in action. It is important that you describe yourself with effective statements that create that picture. Accomplishment statements become the basis for answers to questions in the interview. This will be discussed later in the interview portion of the TAP manual. An accomplishment can be described is a series of actions (skills) that you took to complete the task or project, overcome the challenge, solve the problem or meet/exceed the goal you set and that ended in a positive, measurable result. Creating Accomplishment Statements Step 1: Think of this as a story with a title. Identify the Scenario. Some topics (titles) may include:  A task you performed alone.  A project you worked on as a team member/team leader.  A challenge you overcame in the job setting.  A problem you solved.  A goal you set. Step 2: Identify the action you performed to tell the story. Use the skills you identified on pages 17-21.  Planned, organized and directed a 4 day training exercise. . .

You must craft your own experience statements to reflect your actual work experience as appropriate for each of your targeted resumes. Verb tenses in your experience statements should be consistent with the rest of your resume. If you start writing in the present tense, stick with it. If you used the past tense for the rest of your resume, use it for the experience statements too. These statements are generalized. Your statements need to be targeted to the position you are trying to obtain. The most effective statements are those that are both targeted and results-oriented. To effectively write experience statements you must also include statements that emphasize your results.

Job Search Strategies  Salary History The purpose of a salary history when required by the employer is to determine a salary and compensation fit. This information SHOULD be given if the employer asks for it specifically in a job announcement or on an application. DO NOT give this information unless asked, as current career managers agree that providing prospective employers with your salary history can work against you. When a salary history sheet is required you should calculate your actual salary by factoring in your Base Pay, Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS), Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) and any other special pay allowances. Remember to calculate the rate for the non-taxable value of the tax-free portions of your pay, and any other money added to your pay. Although you are creating this sum based on different items, only write one total sum on the salary history sheet or application that you give to the employer.  91  If you know how, you will always have a job. If you know why, you will be the boss.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

Job Search Strategies  References A reference is someone who can attest to your ability to perform a task, substantiate your training, document your measurable results and/or confirm your qualifications. Some employers prefer to contact references by phone rather than by letter. List 6-8 people who would agree to be a reference for you. Use previous supervisors, professional acquaintances, teachers, etc. You may be asked to include both personal and professional references. If you use a personal reference, make sure they are employed, and preferably in a responsible position. Personal references should not be members of your family. Supervisors, coworkers and teachers are persons to consider when assembling references. For people who will not be physically available (on deployment, moving to another location, overseas, retired) ask them to write a letter of reference for you. Make certain letters are written on letterhead from a company. Employers prefer being able to contact a person by telephone as opposed to a letter. Never relinquish an original letter of reference, always supply a copy. Always ask permission to use a person as a reference. Give a copy of your resume to each reference. Make sure you know how each person wants to be contacted. Have current phone numbers. Recycle the list if you send it out several times. Remember to add your list of references to your career catalog. Type your list in advance so you can mail it out upon request. See following page for an example. 95  Never let what you can not do interfere with what you can do.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   3.

Job Search Strategies  Different Ways To Send A Resume Once the resume content has been determined, the next important step is to determine which method of delivery will be required. It is the goal and responsibility of the applicant to meet the employer's expectations. The procedure may be stated in the job announcement. A quick call to the employer may answer the question. The following information will describe the different ways in which resumes and cover letters can be sent in to an employer. This will enhance the speed in which you can deliver the resume to the employer in the most `appropriate' and preferred form. The mail    most traditional ways in which resumes are sent are by post office or express delivery. The electronic methods include: Fax E-mail as an attachment or inserted as text Electronically generated forms supplied by the company  Each has advantages and disadvantages. Resources which give more information, publications and tutorials on these methods are available through the transition website. E-mailing Resumes Pay close attention when submitting a resume online. Applying for job openings online is a great way to find a wider base of job openings, but there are several techniques and tips for doing this effectively.  You can search a company directly. They will often have you fill out an application online and then have you submit a resume. Most large companies even have a resume builder on their web site. For this information look under ""employment,"" ""occupations,"" ""jobs"" or ""careers.""  You can create a resume with a word processing program and then cut and paste it into the body of an email to submit. Realize that it will often not look the same after you have pasted it into the site. Try to use basic fonts such as Times Roman that are somewhat universal to all systems. Bullets frequently create random spacing, so it is best to leave them out. Text can automatically be left justified and make the beautiful resume you created look unorganized and messy. Bold rarely transfers. You need to look at the text after it is pasted and correct it carefully before submission. Companies may ask that you submit a resume directly through email. Use ASCII text format to submit your resume in this manner.  Some job search sites will not accept attachments. Be sure that you are submitting your resume in the format preferred by the employer.  Recognize that many postings on the Web are from headhunters who will contact you if they feel your resume is significant in terms of placement potential. In this situation, it will be impossible to determine the company to which you are applying.  Keep in mind that submitting resumes online requires the same concentrated effort in terms of targeting information, researching the company and focusing on the specific job description. A well-written resume is just as important here as when faxing or sending through the mail.  98  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   Job Search Strategies  3. Job Search Strategies  Scannable Resumes Some larger companies may have a scanner system to read resumes. Its function is to change the resume printed on paper into an electronic format. The information or `data' can then be processed, compared, assessed or extracted as needed to determine if the applicants are qualified. This is primarily used as a screening technique. Special formatting and keyword or skill sets are required for maximum success. Scannable resumes are used by companies as a method to determine qualifications compared to their database. The format allows the employer to search for key words contained in your resume. The resume writer needs to research and gather information from sources that use specific job descriptors, personal traits and experiences. Use job announcements, industry publications and other profiles which would meet the companies standards, jargon and criteria for that position. 7 Points To Keep In Mind When Creating Scannable Resumes 1. Your name should be the first item on a scannable resume. Scanners will file resumes under first line information. 2. Use nouns: production scheduling, network management, etc., more than verbs: organized, scheduled, maintained, etc. 3. Minimize the use of abbreviations and jargon. 4. Always send originals. Use a laser printer whenever possible. Do not use dot matrix. 5. Do not fold a scannable resume, do not use staples, and avoid compressed space between letters. Use standard sized business paper, no legal or other odd sizes. 6. Use ""fine mode"" when faxing instead of ""regular."" 7. Some employers will ask that you send your resume as a text file, or inserted into the body of an e-mail message. To accomplish this, save your resume in ASCII text format. 99  Ever y man's work, whether it be literature or music or pictures or architecture or anything else, is always a por trait of himself.

Job Search Strategies  3.11 WRITE COVER LETTERS What to Know The purpose of a cover letter is to introduce yourself and sell the employer on how well your specific skills, abilities and attributes match the organization's needs. It is critical that you take the time to prepare a creative, hard-hitting cover letter that gets the attention of the reader immediately. This is the first document a potential employer will see about you and it has to do much of your initial marketing. The cover letter is a chance to ""speak"" to the reader or the interviewer. By developing skills- and achievement-oriented letters, you will give yourself a competitive edge. Each letter needs to be individually developed for each position.  What to Do All effective cover letters have three main parts.  They identify the specific job and how you learned about it.  They match your skills, training, and experience with those required for the job, using your specific knowledge of the company.  The last line should emphasize your interest in the job and indicate your plan for follow-up. Cover Letter Guidelines: 1. The cover letter should not repeat your resume. 2. Use standard business letter format. 3. Type the letter on bond paper that matches your resume. 4. Proofread carefully. Make sure that there are no typographical errors (typos) and that the proper grammar was used. 5. Sell yourself! Make the reader want to speak with you. Be formal, polite, honest, and assertive. 6. Keep the letter to a page or less. 7. Sign and send the original. Keep a copy. 8. Address the letter to the hiring authority and include their title. If you are answering an ad that does not give a person's name, call the company and find out to whom it should be addressed. If you cannot get a specific name, start the letter with ""Dear ________________(manager of department/title of position)."" 9. Do your homework on the company. (Refer to the section 3.4, Research Companies). NOTE: As you work on your own cover letters, use the sample letters on the following pages as a guide. PARTICIPANT MANUAL  101   3. Job Search Strategies  General Outline For A Cover Letter Your Your City, Your Your Name Street Address State, Zip Code Phone Number E-mail Address  Date of Letter Employer's Name Employer's Title Company Name Street Address City, State, Zip Code Dear [Employer's Name]: INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPH: You want to tell the reader why you are writing and name the position or department for which you are applying. You also want to capture the reader's attention. Mention how you heard about the organization or the opening. Name someone you and the reader know in common or someone in the company that knows you. Show you have done some research on the company by talking about new projects the company has taken on, the particular management philosophy they use, or citing something you have read about them. BODY: In this section you want to build a connection between your background and the company's needs. If you have any directly related experience or education, summarize it here so the reader can look for it in your resume. If you have skills or accomplishments that relate to the job, mention them here. You are effectively summarizing your skills as they relate to the company research you have done. Be sure to do this in a confident and positive manner. CONCLUDING INFORMATION: Indicate your interest in the job. Tell the reader you will be calling to follow up.

INTERVIEWS OBJECTIVES The lessons in this chapter prepare you to:  Interview 107  Take employment tests  Present your 30-second commercial  Prepare for interviews  Dress appropriately for interviews  Sharpen listening skills  Interpret body language  Answer questions  Ask questions of the employer  Evaluate the interviews  Analyze a rejection subsequent to an interview  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  4.1 UNDERSTAND THE INTERVIEW PROCESS What to Know The purpose of all interviews is to find the best person for the job. However, interviews can be conducted in different ways. Interviewing is a two-way process. The Interview 1. An individual interview is like an in-depth conversation. The interviewer may be the person who will be your supervisor. Hiring decisions are often made based on this type of interview. Count on discussing your skills, experience, training and how they all relate to the duties and opportunities of the job. There will usually be time for you to ask questions. You must sell your:  skills;  interest; and enthusiasm;   understanding of the job. 2. A panel interview is frequently used by government agencies and companies filling a professional or managerial position. Usually three or more people sit on the board, and all candidates are asked the same questions. A selection board interview usually involves more structured questions than an individual interview, and generally does not include a discussion of salary and benefits. The process can be stressful because you have to answer questions from several people. Be sure to make eye contact with everyone on the panel. When answering a question, it is especially important to make eye contact with the person who asked the question. 3. The phone interview is another strategy that some employers use. In this situation, the hiring manager or selection committee interviews job applicants over the telephone as a screening technique. Phone interviews are used to make a first round of cuts to the applicant pool. If the employers are interested in candidates they will then schedule face-to-face interviews. Remember, as soon as you pick up the telephone you are making an impression. Be sure to review the telephone tips in section 2. 4. Stress interviews are another format that some employers, frequently law enforcement organizations, use to evaluate candidates. The interviewers' job is to intimidate you. They want to find out how you handle stress. The rationale behind the tactic is that if you're unable or unwilling to handle conditions of imposed stress, it's unlikely you'll have the ability to maintain your composure under conditions of real stress. In response to this tactic, it's important that you don't react defensively, but instead remain calm and respond appropriately. 5. The observational interview format may be used by an employer. In this format, the candidate is asked to demonstrate his/her abilities with some of the skills required for the position. This may include giving a demonstration of public speaking ability, answering telephone calls, or operating a piece of equipment while the interviewer observes your performance.  108  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  Interview Stages Most interviews break into four stages. The better you understand each stage, and what is expected of you, the better your chances of being selected. 1. Introductory Stage The interviewer forms an initial impression that can contribute to acceptance or rejection. The decision to hire is not made at this stage, but it begins here. Remember, you never get a second chance to make a first impression! 2. Employer Questions The interviewer tries to determine how well your attitude and skills fit with the company image and work culture. The interviewer is trying to match your specific skills and abilities to the job. 3. Applicant Questions The interviewer is trying to determine your level of interest in the job and your degree of knowledge about the company. This is the time to clear up uncertainties. 4. Closing Stage The interviewer will draw the session to a close. If you are sure you want the job, make your intentions clear at this time. Following are some examples of how you may conclude an interview. As you read the examples, remember, assertive is okay, aggressive is not! ""Mr. Brown, is there anything that I didn't cover that you'd like me to?"" ""After meeting with you, I'm even more convinced that I'd be a good fit for this position."" ""Ms. Jones, when do you plan to fill the position?"" They will usually tell you. If so, you can politely suggest you will call that day. ""If you don't mind, I'd like to call you on that day to find out what my status is."" ""Would it be OK if I called then to check the status of the position?"" Usually the hiring authorities for the position will confer before anyone is offered a job. So, do not expect a decision to be made about the position immediately. 109  What to Do Remember, interviews are about sharing information. Your responsibility is to focus the interview on a match between your skills, knowledge, and experience and the company's needs.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  4.2 TAKE EMPLOYMENT TESTS What to Know Some companies give employment tests as part of the interview process. The tests usually are related to aptitude, basic skills, or attention to detail. Usually they have been normed against people who work in similar positions and have taken the test. The tests help the employer determine if you are likely to be a good fit with the company and the job. Usually your test scores will be in points that are added into a total rating score that is based on your resume, cover letter, references and your interview. Examples are:  Keyboarding  Work Samples  Physical Agility  Personality  What to Do The following is a set of suggestions to use as you take employment tests. Read and consider each suggestion. 110 1. Read and/or listen to directions carefully. 2. Take the tests seriously. 3. Try to relax while taking the test. 4. Skim the entire test before you start to be sure you know what it is about. 5. Read each question carefully and completely before you begin to answer it. 6. Ask if there is a penalty for guessing answers you are not certain about. In general, if there is a penalty, do not guess unless you can narrow the answer to one of two possible choices. 7. If the test is timed--and many are--ask how the test is being scored to know if accuracy or completion is more important. 8. Write your answers clearly. You cannot get credit for anything that is not readable. 9. Use your time wisely. Do not linger too long on any one question. If you do not know the answer, skip to the next item.  Don't get screened out! Employers generally use applications to make the first cut in screening applicants.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  4.3 30-SECOND COMMERCIAL What to Know The 30-second commercial is a statement to describe the skills and services that you have to offer an employer. It is essentially a brief monologue that sells your professional abilities and reflects your ideal job profile.  What to Do Choose a combination of the following components that will comprise your pitch: Greeting ......................include your first and your last name Experience ..................accumulated experience in your specific industry and jobs Areas of Expertise......your major job functions and skill categories Strengths ....................specific skills that you possess Accomplishments ......specific accomplishments that emphasize your strengths Professional Style ......traits and characteristics that describe how you perform your job Job Search Strategy ..what you want to do with your experience 111  Examples of these components: Hello, my name is ______________________.

Interviews  4.4 PREPARE FOR INTERVIEWS What to Know  A successful interview begins with homework and preparation.  Your responsibility is to know as much about yourself and the company before you walk into the interview.  Research the company as much as you can before your interview. Some ways that you can get information about the company include the Internet, asking family and friends who are familiar with the company, asking someone who works there, and researching trade publications.  Planning and preparation makes you confident and will help you perform in the interview.  Practice, practice, practice your answers to common interview questions.  Some questions that you may be asked include: Why did you leave the military? What are your strengths as an employee? Why did you leave your last job? Where do you see yourself in 5 years? What are you looking for in a job? Why are you interested in our company? 112  What to Do Your chances of getting the job are zero if you don't know what you want. You must also know a few things about the company before the interview. Use the guidelines on the following page to prepare for the interview.  A successful job interview requires preparation.

Interviews  4.5 DRESS FOR SUCCESS What to Know You should look your best when you go to a job interview. Dress one step above the dress required for the job. You only get one chance to make a first impression, so make it a good one. Remember, first impressions are formed when the interviewer first sees and greets you. You need to look professional, confident, and competent. To help you decide what to wear to an interview, visit the company and notice what people are wearing. Make sure your interview clothes are appropriate for the job you are applying for and for the location of the interview. Do not wear a suit to an interview at a construction site, and do not wear jeans and a sport shirt to an office setting. You will find differences in the way people dress depending on the industry they work in. It is always better to find yourself over-dressed than under-dressed for an interview. Try to think ahead to the interview. If there is a possibility you will be required to perform a task, make sure you are prepared. For instance, if you are applying for a job as a welder, you may be asked to demonstrate your skills on the spot. You should have your work clothes and tools available at the interview.  Guidelines Dress For Men Use the following list to check yourself prior to an interview. You may want to seek an opinion from someone in the field in which you are interviewing.  Hair should be trimmed, neat, and clean. Have a clean shave. If you wear a beard or a mustache, be sure to trim neatly.  Wear glasses with up-to-date frames and clear lenses. Do not wear sunglasses with dark tints or mirrors.  Wear no more than one ring on each hand and a watch. Do not wear any other jewelry such as bracelets, necklaces or earrings.

(Walter Bagehot)  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  4.6 SHARPEN LISTENING SKILLS What to Know Listening to the interviewer is as essential as talking honestly and openly about your skills and abilities. Concentrate on what is being said and how it is said, rather than on how you are doing. By listening to the interviewer's statements, comments, and questions, you can get a better understanding of the organization and what it would be like to work there. Moreover, in some interview situations, especially managerial interviews, you will be evaluated on your listening skills. The phrase listening skills sometimes surprises people because most people view listening as a natural process rather than a skill. People with this opinion unfortunately have confused the word hearing (a passive activity) with listening (an intentional act that requires skill). Following are some techniques and guidelines that you can use to become a better listener.  What to Do 1. If distractions are a problem in an interview, you can control them in the following ways:  If the distraction is external, control it by focusing your concentration.  If the distraction is internal (inside your head), control it by reminding yourself to pay attention and try to relax. 2. Paraphrase the interviewer's comments by restating the main idea or content to:  check and clarify accuracy;  let the interviewer know you understand; and  encourage more discussion. 3. Focus on key words, main ideas, and examples to help you retain important points. 4. Ask questions if you do not understand what the interviewer is saying or asking. Do not pretend to understand if you do not understand. 5. Take notes only if it will not distract you from the conversation. Write them in a list or outline form. Always ask the interviewer's permission before taking notes. 6. Make sure you understand what you are being asked.  117  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  4.7 INTERPRET BODY LANGUAGE What to Know In a job interview, the interviewer will judge you on how you look and how you act, not just on what you say. Your actions, manner, and appearance add up to your body language. They give nonverbal information about your work-related skills, attitudes, and values. In fact, often nonverbal cues are just as important as verbal information in determining who gets hired. After all, everyone the company interviews will probably be qualified for the job. You want to appear to be more qualified than everyone else. Below are a number of critical nonverbal issues. Familiarize yourself with the positive actions and appearances and use each to your best advantage.  What to Do 1. Dress for success by following the preceding guidelines. The way you look is the first nonverbal message you send. 2. Offer a firm, warm, whole-hand handshake. Shake hands with both men and women the same way. You wouldn't give men and women different salutes, so don't shake hands differently. Practice your handshake before the interview. 3. Make eye contact with the interviewer(s). Your eyes are your most powerful communication tool. Many interviewers use your eye contact to look for enthusiasm, sincerity, and for possible inconsistencies in your responses. If you use natural eye contact, the interview will become more like a conversation between acquaintances, and you will get over some of your nervousness. 4. Sit up straight, but not stiff, and lean forward toward the interviewer, ever-soslightly. Good posture will help you listen and make you look interested. 5. Use natural gestures. If you normally use do so in the interview. Gestures help you nervous energy. One caution here: Avoid your fingers, playing with a pencil or cup your pocket, tapping your foot, swiveling your hands to gesture as you talk, relax, convey enthusiasm and release nervous gestures such as drumming of coffee, jingling the change in in your chair, etc.  118  6. Speak clearly, and not too fast. Expression is a powerful way to show enthusiasm. Do not speak in a monotone voice. Allow your volume to rise and fall and pronounce words clearly. Use good grammar and think before you speak. The interviewer will assess your communication skills based on how clearly you express yourself. 7. Your face conveys your attitude, and reinforces what you say. Avoid frowning. Frowns are an intimidation factor--you don't want to intimidate the interviewer. Smile naturally.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  8. Remain attentive and eager to listen. Reinforce the interviewer's comments with nods just as he or she does with you. 9. Notice the nonverbal cues of the interviewer. The interviewer's facial expressions will let you know how well they are listening. If the interviewer seems not to be paying attention, shorten your answers, use an example, or ask a question. If the interviewer gives indications that the interview is almost over, help bring the session to an end. According to researchers, 65% of the meaning in an interaction is conveyed nonverbally. Birdwhistell, R. (1955) Background to Kinesics. ETC., 13, 10-18.  119  Body language is just as impor tant as verbal communication.  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  4.8 ANSWER QUESTIONS What to Know Most interviewers ask similar questions during job interviews. These questions relate to how your skills, knowledge, training, and work experience fit the job opening in the company. Unfortunately, many job hunters do not expect the questions, and do not practice their answers before an interview. As a result, applicants may not present their strongest assets. It is difficult to give good answers to questions on the spur of the moment. If unprepared, the simplest question can throw you off balance. You can improve your chances for success if you practice answering questions. Read the following questions, write down your own personal answers, and practice your answers out loud. Then, when an interviewer asks one of the questions, you'll be ready. As you read the questions and begin to develop your own answers, use the following ideas: 1. Keep your answers brief, but be certain you answer the questions thoroughly. 2. Use evidence, examples, data and anecdotes to illustrate your points. 120 3. Think about your answer before you start to speak. It is okay to pause and collect your thoughts, and then give your answer. Try to relate your response to the position for which you are applying. 4. Remember, most questions have more than one purpose. As you develop your answers, think about the match between your skills and the company's needs. 5. Every chance you get, explain how you would go about doing a job rather than just saying you can do it. Do not volunteer information you are not asked for--you might talk yourself out of a job.  Be nice to people...nice gets nice, and all things being equal, cour tesy can be ver y persuasive.  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  TOUGH QUESTIONS AND TOUGH ANSWERS The following list of questions and answers may help you prepare for your interview. 1. Tell me about yourself. Be thorough, but brief. Talk for no more than two minutes. Be logical. Be positive. Discuss your education and professional achievements and goals. Then briefly describe your qualifications for the job and the contributions you could make to the organization. Refer to the 30-second commercial in section 4.4. 2. Why did you leave the military? This can be a difficult question. ""I achieved my goals in the military and I'm now looking for a new challenge."" You could then explain what your goals were, how you met them, and where you see yourself going now. 3. Why are you leaving your current position? This is a critical question. Do not bad-mouth previous employers. Don't sound too opportunistic. It is good to state after long personal consideration you wanted an opportunity to expand your background/knowledge. You feel your chance to make a contribution at this time is very low due to company restructuring. Still attempt to score points. 4. What do you consider your most significant accomplishment? This can get you the job. Prepare extensively. Tell a brief story, which includes details and your professional involvement. The problem, action, resolution organization works well here. Describe a situation that presented a problem, detail what actions you took to resolve it, and discuss what the resolution was. This should be an accomplishment that was truly worth achieving. Some aspects that you could discuss include: hard work, deadlines, overcoming obstacles, important company issues and relations with coworkers. 5. Why do you believe you are qualified for this position? Why should I hire you? Pick two or three main factors about the job and about you that are most relevant. Discuss for two minutes, with specific details. Select a technical skill, a specific management skill (organizing, staffing, planning) and a personal success story. 6. Have you ever accomplished something you did not think you could? Show you are goal-orientated, have a strong work ethic, personal commitment and integrity. Provide a good example where you overcame numerous difficulties to succeed. Prove you are not a quitter and you'll get going when the going gets tough. 7. What do you like/dislike about your current position? Interviewer may be trying to determine your compatibility with the open position. Stating you dislike overtime or dislike specific details, or that you dislike ""management"" can cost you the position. There is nothing wrong with liking challenges, pressure situations, opportunity to grow, or disliking bureaucracy. 8. How do you handle pressure? Do you like or dislike these situations? High achievers tend to perform well in high pressure situations. Conversely, this question also could imply that the position is pressure-packed. If you perform well under stress, provide a good example with details, giving an overview of the stress situation. Try to relay the situation as a challenge rather than focusing on your ability to handle pressure. The interviewer will see you turn a negative into a positive situation.  121  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  9. Good employees can take the initiative and get the job done. Can you describe yourself in terms of this statement? A proactive, results-oriented person does not need constant supervision. To convince the interviewer you know how to take initiative you must describe a situation in which you were self-motivated. Try to discuss at least one example in depth. Demonstrate a strong work ethic and creativity. 10. What is the worst or most embarrassing aspect about your career? How would you have done things differently now with 20/20 hindsight? This is a question to find out if you are introspective and if you learn from your mistakes. The right answer indicates an open, flexible personality. Do not be afraid to talk about negative results or problem issues, particularly if you have learned from them. Dynamic, high-performance individuals learn from mistakes. End your story on a positive note. 11. How have you grown or changed over the past few years? To discuss this effectively is indicative of a well balanced, intelligent individual. Maturation, increased technical skills, or increased self-confidence are important aspects of human development. Overcoming personal obstacles, or recognizing manageable weaknesses can make you an approachable and desirable employee. 12. What do you consider your most significant strengths? Know four or five key strengths. Be able to discuss each with a specific example. Select those attributes that are most compatible with the job opening. Most people mention management ability or good interpersonal skills in response to this question. If you can not describe the specific characteristics of management, such as planning, organizing, budgeting, staffing, etc., do not say you have strong management skills. If you mention interpersonal skills you should be able to clearly explain what you mean. 13. What do you consider your most significant weakness? Show by specific example how a weakness can be turned into a strength. Balance any negative with a positive statement. Example: ""I tend to be a workaholic, but have learned to better manage my time."" 14. Deadlines, frustration, difficult people and silly rules can make a job difficult. How do you handle these types of things? If you can't deal with petty frustrations you'll be seen as a problem. You certainly can state your displeasure at the petty side of these issues, but how you overcome them is more important. Diplomacy, perseverance and common sense can often prevail even in difficult circumstances. This is part of corporate America and you must be able to deal with it on a regular basis.  122  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS 15. What kind of work are you looking for? 16.

Interviews  Situational Questions You also need to think about ""What if . . ."" questions. These can be difficult to answer. For instance: ""What would you do if your supervisor told you to do something illegal?"" Use common sense. These types of questions need answers based on your knowledge, experience and personal values. Consider what the employer wants to hear. A calm approach is best. Don't rush into an answer. It is better to cushion your answer. For example: ""One thing I might consider doing, would be . . ."" If the interviewer does not like your solution, you can consider a different approach. Another situational question might ask for an example of how you had to deal with a difficult situation. The interviewer might ask you to describe a time when you had to deal with a difficult supervisor, co-worker, or customer. You should highlight your contributions and keep your answer relevant to the job you are interviewing for. Another area of difficult questions may concern your family responsibilities, age, health or other personal information. They are not always fair questions and may be illegal, but you need to be prepared to deal with them. Refer to the application section that deals with inappropriate questions. You may choose to deal with these type questions by refusing to answer, in which case you will probably not be hired. Another response could be: ""If you can tell me how that relates to the position, I would be happy to answer the question."" You must make the decision about how to answer based on how much you want the job. An interviewer will form opinions about whether you are:               Mature An initiator Emotionally stable/even-tempered Thorough A team worker Self-confident Tactful Assertive Adaptable Conscientious Tough minded A hard worker Self-disciplined Honest and sincere  126  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  Guidelines for Salary Questions 1. Do not mention money or benefits until the interviewer brings it up, or until an offer has been made. 2. Give the amount as a range, for example $20,000 to $23,000 rather than saying $21,000. A range gives room to negotiate. 3. You can find out a realistic salary from researching the occupation. Check the Internet for salary information. Another resource for information might be the local state job service. 4. Sometimes an employer will bring up salary early in an interview. If you are not ready to discuss this question simply say: ""Before I can give an answer to the salary question, I would like to know more about the position."" 5. The best time to discuss the salary and benefits package is after you have a job offer, when you are in a much better bargaining position. 6. Remember, there are many benefits to a job besides salary, such as:  opportunities for advancement and training  benefits, i.e. parking, transportation, tuition reimbursement, childcare onsite, fitness center, health insurance, etc.  good working conditions  good hours, flexible scheduling, etc. 7. If possible, wait until you find out about the benefits and are offered the job before you answer questions about salary. 8. If an employer asks you about the minimum salary you will accept, don't give a figure you think will either be too high or too low. If you are too high, they'll think that you won't take the job at a lower salary and might offer it to someone else. If you are too low, you might get the job at a much lower salary than you could have gotten. This little mistake could cost you thousands of dollars! 9. Here are some ways you can answer the question about minimum salary: ""I'm really interested in long-term growth and advancement. Right now, I'm willing to consider whatever your company pays people with my skills."" ""I don't have a particular amount in mind. I'm interested in a career with your company, not just a job.""  127  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  4.9 ASK QUESTIONS DURING INTERVIEWS What to Know During a job interview, you will be asked questions about your work experience, education, and goals. Your answers and the nonverbal messages you send determine the impression you make. However, interviewers also learn about you, and remember you, by the questions you ask. They often judge your thinking skills based on the kinds of questions you ask. Interviewers respect candidates who think about their choices carefully, and they appreciate knowing you have done your homework. During the interview you will also be deciding if the company is a good place to work. Based on the answers to your questions, you will learn about the employer. Look for a match between the company and your goals, needs, and attitudes. It is a good idea to write out five or six questions before the interview. Revise the questions for each interview based on your research. If a question gets answered before you ask it, choose another question from your list. Your questions should do two things. They should get the information you want to know about the company. They should also reflect your knowledge of the company. Use the information you learned while doing research on the company to write your questions.  128  What to Do Following is a list of suggested questions. Many of these questions could have been answered during research of the company. Do not bother to ask something you already know. Add some questions of your own. 1. I feel I have a clear picture of the job, but could you please give me a few more details? 2. How would you describe a typical day on the job? 3. What are the promotion possibilities? 4. Where does the job fit into the organization? 5. To whom would I report? 6. What other positions would I interface with while performing my duties? 7. How would you describe the work environment? 8. Do your employees work individually or as a team?  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  9. Where is the job located? 10. What career opportunities exist in the company? 11. What further education or training does the company consider important for my future progress? 12. How are performance reviews done? 13. What is the general management style with regard to customer service, products, or employees? 14. Is this a newly-created position or am I replacing someone? 15. How would I be trained or introduced to the job? 16. What are the department's goals for the year? 17. When will you make a decision? 18. Does the company have a promote-from-within policy? 19. What kind of work schedule does the company have? 20. Does the company require employees to relocate, and if so, how is that done? 21. Does the job require travel and, if so, how much? The best questions show that you have done research about the company and, at the same time, get you information you really want to know. The following are three examples of this type of question. Of course, you will tailor each question to the company information and the job opening. 1. What opportunities might I have to work in the ___________ area? 2. Your company literature indicated that the company actively encourages continuing education. What opportunities are there? 3. In your Annual Report, the company president talked about a new fiber optics division. What are the research goals of that division and how would it relate to the division where I am applying? Good questions can use information the interviewer shared with you earlier in the interview. For example, if the interviewer mentioned that the company plans to develop new products, you might ask how those plans will affect the job you are seeking. Some questions are not appropriate for the first interview. Salary and benefits are important, but save those questions until an offer has been made unless the interviewer brings them up. 129  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4. Interviews  Finally, pay attention to the time left in the interview. Usually, the interviewer will invite you to ask questions during the last five to eight minutes of a one hour interview. So, when you have an interview scheduled, write out at least six questions you want to ask to help you get the information you need. Ask only the most important questions. If time is short, say something like: I had hoped to ask you several things, but as our time is short, let me ask the two questions that are most important to me. If you think that there are any questions on the interviewer's mind that might work against your being considered for the position, you can address these questions yourself. Remember, issues are situationally dependent. Some employer concerns might be military spouse issues, commuting, relocation, military stereotypes, disabilities, etc. You might say ""I realize that my home is 40 miles from the office, but I enjoy the time I spend commuting, that wouldn't be a deterrent for me."" ""I realize that many people believe that someone with a military background might be rigid, but I pride myself on being innovative. I enjoy change"" or ""I realize that accepting this job would mean relocating to another state, but my family and I have already discussed it and agree that it would be a great opportunity for us."" Another way that you can address these issues is by asking the interviewer if there are any questions that you haven't answered to his/her satisfaction. DON'T address limitations that the interviewers aren't already aware of or that won't interfere with your ability to do the job.  130  Keep away from people who tr y to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.(Mark Twain)  TRANSITION  ASSISTANCE  PROGRAM   4. Interviews  4.10 FOLLOW UP AFTER INTERVIEWS What to Know Every interview is an opportunity to improve your interviewing skills. You can also maximize your potential for success in every interview. To help you learn from your experience and to increase your chances for success, do two things at the end of each interview: 1. Send a thank you note or letter to the interviewer. 2. Take a few notes about how you did.  What to Do Do these two things right after each interview. Your notes will be most useful if you make them while the interview is still fresh in your mind. Use the Post Interview Checklist on the following page. The notes will help you in two ways: 1. If you are called for a second interview, you can easily review what went on in the first. If you note what you wore you can dress appropriately for the second interview as well. 2. If you do not get the job, you can review your interview performance and improve it for the next time. Only about 5% of those looking for jobs actually send thank you letters. Write a thank you letter soon after the interview, the same day is best. Be sure to check spelling, grammar, and punctuation. You can type or hand write this letter. You should tailor your letter to the culture of the company and the relationship you established with the interviewer. Send a formal business letter if you feel the interviewer and the company call for that. If you established a good rapport with the interviewer, send a handwritten note. As for e-mailing thank you notes, career experts and employers are not in total agreement, but the company's culture should guide you. If people in the company rely heavily on e-mail, your e-mailed thank you will seem appropriate. It is also a fast solution if you know the company will be making its hiring decision quickly. It is still a good idea to follow up your e-mailed thank you with a hard-copy version. The thank you letter is a good way to add anything you forgot, or wish you had said in the interview. You can reinforce important information that you provided in the interview. You can state your interest in the job, or you can let the employer know that you appreciate their time. If you were interviewed by a panel, it is best to send a thank you letter to each of the interviewers. Be sure to vary the letters by a few sentences in case they compare them.  131  PARTICIPANT  MANUAL   4.

Interviews  4.11 ANALYZE WHY YOU DID NOT GET A JOB What to Know There are many factors that can prevent you from getting a job, such as:  Sometimes the company decides not to hire anyone, or hires someone with more experience;  Sometimes they hire from within the company;  Sometimes your style does not fit the style they want; or  Sometimes you are overqualified and the interviewer believes you will not stay with the company. Rejections are part of the process and you should not get discouraged. Don't take it personally--sometimes the company's decision has nothing to do with you. But you should learn from every interview how to improve your interview skills. In that way, you can keep your self-esteem and improve your chances for success. Look at the following list of factors, and think about how many of them are in your control. Start now, and work on the ones that you can get under control as you prepare for your interview. 135  A turn in the road is not the end of the road unless you fail to make the turn.

The President asked Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.   The Office of Personnel Management Welfare to Work web pages provide guidance regarding hiring authorities available for use in the efforts of Executive Departments and Agencies to provide employment opportunities for welfare recipients.    In his March 8, 1997, memorandum, President Clinton identified the  Worker-Trainee Program  as an option agencies can use to hire people off the welfare rolls.  To provide you with updated information on this program, we have included a description of the  programs background  as well as specifics relating to  current appointment provisions .    In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, federal agencies have many additional hiring options to consider.  Among them are permanent, temporary and term appointments in the  competitive service , as well as numerous  excepted service authorities .  These excepted service authorities include many that are agency-specific, and a number that are government-wide authorities.  These web pages describe the government-wide authorities most likely to be used for the Welfare to Work program.  In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, there may be a number of welfare recipients who qualify for the appointment options requiring additional experience, education and/or military service.

GX236-58-13895165	"Employment Security/Workforce Development System Service Quality Mystery Shop Executive Summary May 2003 The statewide mystery shopping project key findings for mystery shops completed between June 2002 and March are summarized below. The goals of this program are to measure the levels of customer service quality and satisfaction, and, to recognize staff who receive the highest rating for the overall service experience. Between June 2002 and March 2003, the mystery shoppers made 239 in-person visits, 203 telephone calls, and 40 Internet inquiries to the WorkSource service delivery and Unemployment Insurance systems  including Workforce Development administrative offices through the state, and, Employment Security Department's Central Office. When rating the overall service received from staff that helped them the most, shoppers used a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5, outstanding. In-Person Average overall rating for in-person shops for the first four quarters was 3.7, on a fivepoint scale. Ratings ranged from as low as 3.5 to as high as 4.1. In all, almost one out of three shops (30%) was rated 5, Outstanding. Only one in ten (11%) shops did not meet expectations (rated a 1 or 2). Facilities  Facilities were almost always observed to be clean and neat.  Parking lots and exteriors were rated well maintained and free of litter in 97% of visits.  Entryways and interiors were rated well maintained and free of litter in 99% of shops.  Facilities almost always appeared safe, with shoppers only seeing something that would cause a safety hazard or cause a barrier for a person with disabilities in 2% of shops.  Facility layout could be improved, as: Feedback forms were easily locatable in 49% of shops at WorkSource and affiliate* locations.  Non-English signage was only visible in 44% of shops.  Signage or kiosks** telling how to apply for unemployment insurance benefits were obvious to the shopper in only 59% of shops at WorkSource or affiliates. * Service  Wait times were acceptable:  Three of four (82%) shoppers waited less than 2 minutes, with half (54%) of the shoppers having no wait at all.  Only 3% of shoppers had to wait over 10 minutes.  Staff who scored a 4 or 5 tended to show a genuine interest in the customer, and attempted to research the question themselves. Employment Security Department/Office of Quality and Organizational Performance Barbara Burgener, Director  1      When the customer was in the wrong office, such as a region office or headquarters, staff would give directions to the nearest WorkSource office, and tell them about the ESD web site. In lower rated shops, staff did not take much interest in the customer. When the customers asked a lead in question not directly related to the staff office, they were talked down to, or just not given any useful information of who they should contact. Top Performers (staff whose performance was rated 5, Outstanding), tended to more frequently:        Provide personalized service that made the customer feel valued Ask probing questions to better understand the customer's situation Smile when greeting the customer  Telephone: Overall ratings for telephone shops remained rather flat throughout all quarters, ranging from 2.6 to 3.0, with an average rating of 2.9. Twelve percent (12%) of calls were rated 5, Outstanding. Just over one in three (39%) of the calls were rated 1 or 2 (not meeting expectations). During calls rated 4 or 5, staff often treated the caller with respect, and addressed the callers concern with respect and interest. Staff also asked sufficient questions to properly refer the caller when the employee could not assist the caller. On lower rated calls, staff often:  Were rushed, and did not speak with a pleasant voice.  Did they ask questions, or refer the caller to someone who could assist the caller with their problem.  Did not look for other ways that WorkSource could assist the caller, even if they could assist. Top-Performers (i.e., staff whose performance was rated 5, Outstanding) on the phone tended to more frequently:       Ensure the caller's needs were met in closing. Thank the caller for calling.

In previous quarters, scenarios included service requests from other job seekers and business customers. Fourth quarter ratings indicate an overall improvement in customer satisfaction. There was a significant increase in the number of top performers as well as increases in overall service rating for each shopping category. In-Person The average overall rating for in-person shops this quarter was 3.9, up from the average of 3.5 in Quarter 3. In all, 30 of 67 in-person shops were rated 5, Outstanding. Only nine shops did not meet expectations (rated a 1 or 2). In lower rated in-person shops, staff showed little interest in the customer, asking few or no questions about their situation, and may have pointed towards the computers and told them to look up job listings. Telephone In telephone shops, Top Performers, tended to more frequently:  Ask probing questions to better understand the customer's situation Employment Security Department/Office of Quality and Organizational Performance Barbara Burgener, Director  3          Sincerely thank the customer Provide personalized service that made the customer feel valued Smile when greeting the customer In closing, ensure the caller's needs were met Thank the caller for calling Fulfill the caller's needs  The overall ratings for telephone shops improved since last quarter (3.0, up from 2.6). Twenty percent (20%) of calls were rated 5, Outstanding. Just over one in three (37%) of the calls this quarter were rated 1 or 2 (not meeting expectations). On lower rated calls:  Staff were unable to understand the caller, and did not attempt to assist.  Some staff sounded annoyed that the caller did not speak English. In more than one call, co-workers laughter at the employee's predicament was audible.  Phone menus for Spanish speaking callers did not always lead to a Spanishspeaking employee. E-Mail All addresses were WorkSource locations found at: www.wa.gov/esd/work/wsdirectory_local.htm. Of the 10 inquiries sent, 9 responses were received. The average overall scores were 3.7, the same as last quarter. Almost all responses (7 of 9) were received in one day or less. One response came over a month later. Most of the inquiries were forwarded to a veteran's representative. Outstanding responses were well written, friendly, and actively promoted the usefulness of the services. The following are recommendations for responding to this quarter's mystery shopper data:  Congratulate top performers via public recognition  Share the individual reports and comments with all staff  Set a target for overall customer experience rating improvement in your area of accountability.

GX255-39-4092462	"Reforming Public Sector Human Resource Management Best Practices From the Practitioner's View ROBERT LAVIGNA State of Wisconsin  As Chapter 24 in Steven W. Hays and Richard C. Kearney (Eds) Public Personnel Administration: Problems and Prospects. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall (Pearson Education), 2003: pp. 352-366. ISBN: 0-13-041378-X   REFORM IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR: THE CHALLENGE Across the nation, all levels of government are being called on to improve service and responsiveness. These calls for reform, often called reengineering or reinventing government, address virtually every aspect of public sector structure and operations, including size, organization, cost, responsiveness, quality, timeliness, service, budgeting and procurement practices, and regulatory activities. The National Performance Review report glibly summed up this demand for reform by concluding that government should ""... work better and cost less."" Inevitably, discussions about government reform focus on personnel and human resource management (HRM). There seems to be almost unanimous agreement that public sector HRM systems are not working--that personnel is inflexible, inefficient, and unresponsive (Gore, 1993). Demands for more efficient government are justified and perhaps even overdue, and reform is clearly possible, especially in HRM. However, to be successful, reform cannot be based solely on the need for efficiency--reformers must also pay attention to the powerful forces that influence government, and influence the people who manage government. Calls for reform often seem to be based on the premise that government institutions are rational organizations with clear goals and objectives, efficiency being chief among them. In fact, managing government requires constantly balancing complex and conflicting goals and influences, some of which are decidedly not rational. In this environment, managing government is tough enough; reforming government is an even tougher challenge. The conflicting goals of government, as well as the diverse and often opposing constituencies governmental institutions must balance, often prevent the public sector from operating efficiently. For example, is it efficient to conduct lengthy public hearings before making critical decisions, or to require time-consuming rule-making processes to implement important policies, or to reward an agency's cost-efficiency by taking away unspent funds, or to require time-consuming bidding before buying an item that can be purchased faster and maybe even cheaper over the counter? Similar to give appoint year or already examples of apparent inefficiencies abound in public sector personnel. Is it rational employees job security that prevents managers from firing poor performers, or to chief executives who have little relevant experience and who may serve for only a two, or to recruit widely and solicit applications for months when the hiring manager knows who he or she will hire?  These practices may not be efficient, but they exist for valid reasons. Public hearings, lengthy rule-making processes, budget and purchasing controls, employment safeguards, political appointments, and open competition for jobs exist to meet legitimate goals and stakeholder interests. These often-inefficient practices were conceived to provide public access, hold government accountable for spending tax dollars carefully, ensure fairness and merit, and maintain the balance of power in our pluralist political system. Moreover, government also serves a demanding and diverse group of stakeholders-- elected chief executives and their political appointees; state legislatures and local government councils; the courts; oversight agencies (e.g., budget, personnel, auditing); the media; clients who demand services; employees; unions; lobby groups; and the public. Each of these constituent groups has a different view of what government's role should be overall, and what individual agencies' goals and priorities should be in particular. Inevitably, 2   some stakeholders will be dissatisfied with the results of government's attempt to manage the difficult balancing act of resolving conflicting demands. The public sector must also be productive while operating under often intense public scrutiny. While public hearings and ""freedom of information"" requirements provide necessary access to decision making, these processes often interfere with timeliness, efficiency and productivity. Finally, public sector managers cannot rely on market influences to stimulate, measure and reward efficiency. Many government managers would welcome the chance to be judged by clear and objective measures such as revenue, profit, and market share. Instead, they must constantly try to develop indirect measures of success. In this complicated environment, government organizations trying to improve unique and difficult challenges. Even when government managers want operations--""... work better and cost less""--it is not as easy as it sounds. that do not recognize that government must respond to a wide range of doomed to failure. efficiency face to streamline Reform efforts influences are  The question therefore is how to resolve the inevitable conflict between rational management that emphasizes efficiency, productivity, and speed and political public management that emphasizes consensus, compromise, and openness. Does this conflict mean that government can't be reformed? Of course not--it just makes changing government more complicated. REINVENTING GOVERNMENT HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (HRM) SYSTEMS At every level of government, personnel/HRM systems are being criticized as inflexible, unresponsive, slow, rule-bound, and user-unfriendly. Civil service systems are criticized for not meeting the needs of their customers--both the customers within the organization that personnel exists to support and the citizens government exists to serve. Too often, HRM processes are viewed as hindering, rather than helping, public sector organizations attract, motivate and retain the talented people government must have to provide responsive service to its citizens (National Commission on the State and Local Public Service, 1993). While almost everyone seems to agree that personnel/HRM systems must become more responsive and flexible, turning this rhetoric into reality is a tough challenge in the complex environment of government. For example, one ""common-sense"" approach to personnel reform is to make it easier to fire, demote or transfer employees. The current process can indeed be lengthy and frustrating--why can't an incompetent bureaucrat simply be fired? One answer is because firing ""at will"" conflicts with one of the fundamental reasons civil service/merit systems were created--to prevent patronage and other abuses. While firing processes can indeed be inefficient, they also prevent employees from being removed for the wrong reasons. The U.S. Supreme Court has even ruled that public sector employees have property rights to their jobs and cannot be fired without due process. This philosophy is profoundly different from the private sector's ""employment at will"" approach, which is itself being eroded.  3   It is also important to understand that public sector employees are fired for cause, proving that the system can work. Further, removing poor performers in the private sector isn't always easy either, especially in large companies with labor unions. Bureaucracy is certainly not unique to government. HR reformers must also recognize that much of the so-called ""red-tape"" created by the Congress, state legislatures, city councils, etc., was not created arbitrarily. These laws and rules were designed to base personnel decisions on merit, protect employee rights, provide the public with access, and limit political influence. Although the corruption and abuse that created the need for civil service systems may no longer be as widespread as it was when these systems were devised, this doesn't mean these systems should be scrapped. Consider what the Chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee said about civil service reform: ""I'm not interested in a reform that makes it easy for an agency manager to hire his neighbor's son or daughter over a more qualified applicant. Simply giving greater discretion to managers is a recipe for bringing back the spoils system"" (Hill and Johnson, 1998). In other words, there are two sides to the reform coin--what is reform to one person may appear to be a license for abuse to another. Appeals for more flexibility in hiring and firing can conflict with other pressures for meritbased hiring, affirmative action, veterans' preference, due process, or whistle-blower protection. For example, the public sector has historically employed a higher percentage of women and minorities than the private sector, in part because of affirmative action requirements that can be inefficient but have nonetheless helped many public sector organizations achieve diversity. Personnel reformers must also consider the many constituencies government serves-- managers; employees; unions; veterans, minority, and women's groups; Congress, state legislatures and local government councils; personnel appeals commissions and boards; the courts; job applicants; the public; and so on. In addition, government personnel processes are designed to be open and accessible, not just efficient. The spoils systems that civil service replaced often operated efficiently, but no one wants to bring patronage back. Best Practices in HR Reform Despite these daunting challenges, there is evidence that public sector personnel systems can indeed become more efficient, effective, and responsive. There is broad consensus across the nation that government personnel systems must be overhauled. For example, the National Commission on the State and Local Public Service (1993) called for an end to ""civil service paralysis."" Some specific suggestions:  Decentralize personnel processes to give greater authority to operating units and  managers.  Eliminate outdated and restrictive rules.  Simplify job classification, compensation, and performance management systems to give  managers more flexibility to assign, motivate, and reward employees.  Make hiring easier and faster.  Make firing truly poor employees easier.  Provide more and better employee training.  4   Some jurisdictions are successfully putting these ideas into practice by creating more flexible personnel systems. Several national projects are identifying these ""best practices"". These projects include the benchmarking/best practices initiative of the International Personnel Management Association (IPMA) and the National Association of State Personnel Executives (NASPE), as well as innovation-awards programs separately administered by both organizations (IPMA 1998; NASPE 1997). These benchmarking and awards programs have highlighted innovative practices in federal, state, and local government that show that public sector organizations are reforming their HRM systems. In key areas--including recruiting and hiring, classification and compensation, diversity, training, and labor relations--the public sector is successfully adopting new and more effective approaches. Recruiting and Hiring Talent To meet the challenge of recruiting talent in the most competitive labor market in recent history, public sector organizations are creating more responsive, timely, and user-friendly hiring processes that still preserve fundamental merit principles. Traditionally, public sector hiring practices have focused on the testing process, to identify the best-qualified candidates. The assumption has been that enough qualified applicants would take civil service exams to create a pool of qualified candidates for each vacancy. It is indisputable that written civil service exams used by many jurisdictions are valid and reliable and therefore work well to identify the best-qualified candidates. However, as the labor market has become extraordinarily tight across the nation, public sector organizations are realizing that a valid and reliable testing instrument will not guarantee a good hire, particularly if many qualified applicants refuse to participate in what can be a lengthy and frustrating process. Moreover, after decades of ""government bashing,"" the public sector is no longer the career of choice for most job seekers. As a result, it has been said that too often the civil service exam process identifies not ""the best and the brightest,"" but ""the best of the desperate."" Government is rising to the challenge of competing in a labor market that has become a seller's market for talent. Jurisdictions have amended civil service laws, expanded recruiting activities, developed more competitive alternatives to traditional written exams, and applied technology to the hiring process. Some jurisdictions have successfully amended civil service laws to make hiring processes more flexible. Wisconsin state government, for example, repealed the ""rule of five"" that limited hiring managers to interviewing only the top few qualified candidates. Wisconsin's former law was so restrictive that if two candidates were ranked fifth and sixth with identical scores, to the one one-hundredth of a point, both candidates could not be interviewed--the central personnel department was forced to break the tie somehow. As in most jurisdictions with rigid laws like this, the rule of five slowed down hiring (because all applicants had to be numerically ranked), limited supervisors' hiring choices, and frustrated and even drove away applicants. In 1997, however, the Wisconsin Governor signed amendments that repealed the rule of five, replacing it with a more flexible provision that eliminated all arbitrary restrictions on the number of qualified candidates who can be interviewed. Now, the central personnel department works with individual operating agencies to determine how many qualified candidates to refer to hiring managers. The result is a more timely and flexible process that 5   gives larger numbers of candidates realistic job opportunities. Lists of qualified candidates are routinely produced as soon as the application period ends. In some cases, hiring agencies can now make immediate job offers to well-qualified candidates, a practice that was impossible under the old law (IPMA News, 1999). Local governments have also moved away from rigid limits on the number of qualified candidates who can be referred to hiring managers. For example, the Shreveport, Louisiana, Personnel Department provides hiring managers with all candidates with the top three civil service scores. While this may seem restrictive, managers almost always receive many more than three names because all candidates with the highest three scores (including ties) are forwarded. Other jurisdictions such as Maricopa County, Arizona, and the South Florida Water District have even more flexible practices. In these jurisdictions, there are no restrictions on the number of qualified candidates hiring managers can interview. If a hiring manager chooses to, he or she can interview all candidates who qualify. Of course, no hiring system can be effective unless qualified applicants apply. For that reason, many government agencies are aggressively expanding recruiting, which in the past was often viewed as primarily a private sector activity. Some in government even believed that recruiting violated merit principles because recruited applicants received more assistance and encouragement than other applicants. The realities of today's labor market are changing these attitudes. Government organizations are now hiring full-time recruiters, expanding marketing efforts and even going head-to-head with private sector employers. The Metropolitan Council in the Twin Cites of Minneapolis and St. Paul is a good example. The Council, which has over 3,800 employees, now has a full-time recruiter who focuses heavily on recruiting candidates for hard-to-fill positions in information technology and other technical fields. Rather than apologizing for recruiting for a government agency, the Council's recruiter emphasizes the advantages of public service. Marketing itself as a stable, family-friendly, long-term employer enabled the Metropolitan Council to fill all vacancies in information systems (IS) positions, even at the height of the Y2K ""crisis"" (IPMA News, 2000). The South Florida Water District routinely recruits on college campuses, going head-tohead with private sector firms. In order to compete more effectively, the District involves hiring managers in on-campus recruiting and gives them the ability to make immediate job offers to exceptionally well-qualified candidates. This approach has made the District much more competitive for college graduates in professional and technical positions. Maricopa County also recruits aggressively and has developed a system to automatically fax job ads each week to local community and other organizations that have been sources of recruits in the past. Of course, even the best recruiting will not work unless the hiring process itself is effective, efficient, and user-friendly. That is one reason why public sector organizations are relying less and less on traditional civil service written exams, and more and more on alternative assessment approaches. For example, the 2000 IPMA/NASPE benchmarking survey of over 180 public sector jurisdictions showed that less than one-half rely on written job knowledge exams as one of their three most often-used assessment approaches (IPMA News 2000).  6   Alternative assessment approaches include training and experience evaluations known as achievement history questionnaires, in which candidates submit narrative information relating their backgrounds to required skills and experiences. Another approach is the skills inventory, where candidates report their training, education and/or experience in key skill areas, often using a checklist format. Maricopa County, for example, makes extensive use of skills checklists, where applicants check the descriptions that best reflect their skill/experience levels. Candidates are then added to databases and referred to hiring managers based on each job's particular needs. Wisconsin uses the same approach for occupations with easily identifiable skill requirements such as IS jobs. Government organizations are also relying more heavily on requiring candidates to submit rsums as their application materials, again in part to compete with the private sector. San Jose, California, for instance, frequently requires candidates to submit rsums and cover letters. Candidates are then evaluated and grouped into ""bands"" (e.g., ""best qualified,"" ""qualified"") based on analyses of their cover letter and rsum information. Of course, many public sector organizations still rely on written exams. However, some of these organizations are creating more timely and efficient systems to administer and score them. For example, Baton Rouge, Louisiana offers continual ""walk-in"" testing for jobs that require multiple-choice exams. This approach has eliminated delays resulting from requiring candidates to mail applications and then schedule testing sessions. Now, candidates can test at any time and lists of qualified candidates (registers) are created or updated each week. Maricopa County has also adopted walk-in testing and has taken this approach a step further by immediately scanning and scoring all written exams. Test takers receive immediate results and are continually added to employment registers. In conjunction with more efficient and user-friendly methods like these, public sector organizations are using shorter application periods to speed the hiring process. In the past, in an effort to ensure that the public was given the widest possible access to government job opportunities, jurisdictions often used application periods of up to two months. While this does provide wide access for potential applicants, this practice can also slow down the hiring process. Well-qualified candidates with job options may accept other jobs by the time the application period ends. In response, government agencies have begun to use shorter application periods, often complemented by aggressive recruiting. For example, Maricopa County often uses a five-day application period and then provides hiring managers with lists of qualified candidates within five days. Of course, the Maricopa Personnel Department recruits aggressively during the one-week application period. Shreveport, Louisiana also has a five-day recruiting period that enables the city Personnel Department to provide hiring managers with lists of qualified candidates within five days. Shreveport announces vacancies each Monday on its web site and automatically faxes or emails vacancy announcements to over 120 recruiting sources including colleges, community-based organizations, and even churches (NASPE, 1997). On the other end of the spectrum are organizations that recruit for hard-to-fill and highvolume vacancies by allowing candidates to apply at any time, without any deadlines. This continuous application approach allows these jurisdictions to recruit and accept applications without the restrictions of deadlines. For example, Wisconsin accepts applications continuously for hard-to-fill jobs in fields such as information technology, health care, and accounting/auditing. Candidates are entered into applicant databases and referred to hiring 7   managers when there are vacancies. Similarly, Fairfax County, Virginia, uses open continuous recruiting for many positions. Candidates apply, are entered into a database, and are then eligible for hiring consideration for six months (Hill and Johnson, 1998). Another hiring innovation that combines several new approaches is on-site interviewing and immediate job offers. To meet tough labor market competition, some public sector agencies are conducting immediate interviews at job fairs and on college campuses. Candidates are quickly screened to determine if they are qualified and then the qualified applicants are interviewed by line managers. These managers have the authority to make immediate job offers. Usually, these job offers are contingent on reference or other background checks. The South Florida Water Management District, for example, arranges for teams of personnel staff and line managers to travel together to job fairs and college campuses. The personnel staff accept rsums, review them immediately, and decide which candidates are qualified. The qualified applicants are then interviewed by the hiring managers, who have the authority to negotiate salaries and make contingent job offers. These offers are contingent on successful completion of the remainder of the hiring process, including employment verifications, reference checks, drug screening, etc. This approach has made the District a much more competitive employer for technical staff such as IS professionals, attorneys, environmental scientists, geographers, chemists, and construction inspectors. About 80 percent of the District's 1,700 employees work in technical fields like these. Wisconsin has adopted a similar approach for hard-to-fill positions in fields such as IS and accounting. Like the South Florida Water Management District, Wisconsin personnel staff and line managers attend job fairs together. The personnel staff administer a short selfassessment questionnaire to interested candidates to determine their eligibility. The questionnaire is developed beforehand in cooperation with the hiring managers. Eligible candidates are then interviewed by hiring managers, who can make immediate, contingent job offers. More often, the best-qualified candidates are immediately scheduled for a more detailed follow-up interview in the offices of the hiring agency. Oregon uses a similar approach for IS candidates at job fairs. Oregon personnel staff immediately schedule candidates for interviews, which are conducted within one week of the job fair (Lavigna, 2001). In addition to these new assessment approaches, public sector organizations are using technology to help recruit qualified applicants in a more timely and efficient way. The South Florida Water Management District, for example, allows candidates to submit applications through the Internet. Candidates who do not have Internet access can submit paper applications, which the District then immediately scans into its on-line database. Hiring agencies directly access this data base, enter their requirements, and receive lists of candidates who meet their specifications. Wisconsin has adopted a similar approach for IS jobs. Candidates complete an on-line skills inventory and are immediately added to the applicant database. Hiring managers then access the database on-line, specify their skill requirements, and receive lists of qualified candidates. In the future, Wisconsin plans to expand this system to other job classifications. Fairfax County has automated its hiring process by creating a computerized rsum bank. Candidates submit their rsums, which are then scanned into a computerized database that County personnel staff use to provide hiring agencies with candidate lists. In addition, Fairfax allows candidates to apply by telephone or through the county's web site. If an 8   applicant has already submitted a rsum, he or she can apply for any other county job by simply calling the county's interactive voice response system or accessing the web site and identifying the other position(s) they wish to apply for. Creating Flexible Classification and Compensation Systems Many public sector organizations are also reforming their practices in another key HR area--classification and compensation. Compensation, in particular, is one area where government has lagged behind other employers, in part because many public sector organizations must negotiate compensation changes with labor unions. Recently, however, governments have begun to dramatically change classification and compensation systems, in some cases in cooperation with unions. In classification, perhaps the most significant reform has been aggressive efforts to reduce the number of classifications to decrease system complexity and increase flexibility. South Carolina's Office of Human Resources, for example, conducted a comprehensive review of its classification system, which consisted of over 2,500 different job classifications and 50 separate salary ranges. The review showed that employees were confused by this complex system and did not understand the frequently minor distinctions between job classifications. In addition, the small (four percent) difference between salary ranges was too small to recognize legitimate differences between the values of different jobs. The Office of Human Resources responded by reducing the number of from 2,500 to 500, and the number of pay ranges from 50 to 10 wider result, job classification is now much simpler and the broader pay ranges agencies with much greater flexibility to manage employee compensation job classifications pay bands. As a provide operating (NASPE, 1999).  Other jurisdictions are also reducing the number of job classifications. New York State, the oldest and one of the largest state civil service systems (with over 170,000 employees), eliminated over 2,000 job classifications. This change enabled the state to update its job specifications and reduce a backlog of over 600 civil service exams. At the other end of the size spectrum is the town of Blacksburg, Virginia that has only a few hundred employees. Blacksburg transitioned from a complex system that had 80 job classifications and 15 pay grades to a system with 50 classifications and just 4 broader pay bands. The new system gives Blacksburg's managers far greater flexibility to adjust employee compensation to meet market conditions, thus improving the town's ability to recruit and retain employees. Other jurisdictions have also changed their compensation approaches to improve their ability to recruit, retain and reward employees. New approaches include awarding hiring bonuses for hard-to-fill positions (state of Minnesota), giving bonuses to employees who refer candidates who are hired (Minnesota and the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities), and awarding bonuses and pay raises to employees who acquire new skills or take on special projects (Kansas and South Carolina). This trend toward more flexible compensation systems has moved to the federal government, which has traditionally used a rigid grade and step compensation system, in which pay raises were determined almost exclusively by tenure and seniority. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), for example, has re-designed its compensation system, in cooperation with its unions. Now, instead of granting pay increases to employees solely on tenure, FAA bases pay and pay raises on skill, knowledge, ability and performance. The  9   new compensation system also provides the flexibility to establish separate compensation systems to meet business needs (e.g., creating a separate system for executives). Kansas has gone beyond many other public sector organizations by implementing an ""employee contracting program"" for IS staff. Employees with critical IS skills can sign a three-year contract in which they forfeit civil service status. In exchange, the employees receive salary increases of up to 15 percent and additional training. This program has helped keep turnover in IS positions below the overall turnover rate in Kansas state government. As mentioned above, a compensation approach gaining popularity is ""broadbanding"" of pay ranges. Broadbanding means reducing the number of pay ranges and expanding the width of these ranges (now called ""bands""). Along with this structural change, broadbanding typically gives hiring managers more flexibility to set starting salaries and award pay raises and bonuses. For example, Wisconsin's broadband system (which covers over 6,000 professional employees) allows hiring managers to negotiate starting salary anywhere within the pay range. Before broadbanding, the starting salary was limited to the minimum of the pay range. In addition, managers can award yearly pay increases or bonuses of up to 10 percent of annual salary for a variety of reasons, including matching a competitor's salary offer. The broadband system, which was first applied to IS staff and has now been expanded to other professionals, has helped reduce both vacancies and turnover. The Wisconsin broadband system was also initially implemented through negotiation with a labor union. This is significant because unions have traditionally resisted systems that provide managers with this kind of pay flexibility (Lavigna, 2001). Achieving Work Force Diversity Historically, the public sector has been a leader in creating and maintaining work force diversity. The IPMA and NASPE best practice leaders demonstrate some of the approaches government agencies have taken to achieve diversity. In Washington, for example, diversity activities are directed by the governor's office through the governor's Affirmative Action Committee which was established by Executive Order. The committee provides statewide policy guidance, approves agency affirmative action plans, monitors progress by individual agencies, and shares successes with all agencies. To support the committee, the Washington Department of Personnel has aggressively expanded diversity recruiting, in part by developing a comprehensive directory of recruiting sources and distributing the directory to all state agencies. Washington also continually evaluates barriers to diversity, by reviewing exit interviews completed by protected class members to identify any patterns that may reveal barriers to diversity. Minimum job qualifications are also continually analyzed to ensure they are not creating barriers for protected groups. Finally, managers' individual performance standards include measures of their efforts to diversify their staffs. Oklahoma also has a strong commitment to diversity that is also driven by support from the governor's office as well as state law. Oklahoma has a statutory Affirmative Action Review Council that advises the state's personnel director on diversity standards and approaches. The council includes two members appointed by the governor, two appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives, and two appointed by the president of the Senate. Also by state law, any agency that does not make progress toward achieving 10   diversity must take corrective action including participating in special recruiting programs, developing diversity training, or even submitting all hiring and promotion recommendations to the central personnel department for approval. The law even empowers the state personnel director to take over the personnel functions of agencies that fail to show progress toward achieving a diverse work force. In many jurisdictions, a key to achieving diversity is conducting ""utilization analyses"" to identify the occupational groups where minorities and females are underrepresented. Utilization analyses compare on-board representation of these groups to labor market availability, often by specific job classification. Wisconsin and the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, base their diversity recruiting strategies on these utilization analyses. The Wisconsin Department of Employment Relations has a full-time affirmative action recruiter who works closely with colleges and community-based organizations to attract minority applicants, particularly for job classifications where women and/or minorities are underrepresented (i.e., where on-board representation is less than the overall labor market availability for these groups). St. Petersburg has an even more aggressive diversity strategy. When the city's utilization analysis reveals underrepresentation, the city's affirmative action plan requires a ""1 for 1"" hiring policy--at least one member of a protected class must be hired or promoted each time a non-protected class member is hired or promoted. The city complements this aggressive diversity policy by requiring all top managers to attend diversity training and by providing diversity instruction as part of orientation for new employees. These approaches are succeeding in diversifying the work forces of these jurisdictions. The state government work forces in Oklahoma and Wisconsin, for example, now have higher percentages of women and minorities than the percentages of these groups in both states' overall labor forces. Washington has also achieved parity for minorities in state government, based in large part on a 35 percent increase in minority state employees from 1987 to 1998. In St. Petersburg, minority and female representation has increased in nearly every job category including protective services, professionals, and senior managers. Improving Skills Through Training Too often in the public sector, employee training does not receive enough resources or attention, and is one of the first activities to be cut back during all-too-frequent budget crises. While this is also true in the private sector, it is a particular problem in government where public and legislative pressure to reduce spending often leads to budget reductions. Of course, cutting training budgets is shortsighted because the primary resources of government are the skills and abilities of public employees. To enhance these skills and abilities, some public organizations are expanding training efforts. Oklahoma, for example, has identified the basic competencies required for each managerial level in state government and has based its training curriculum on these competencies. Oklahoma defines competencies as ""human qualities or characteristics associated with effective performance of a task."" In 1998, for example, the state estimated that its competencies-based training approach returned over $1 million in savings and cost reductions. Other public jurisdictions are also developing new approaches to evaluate training effectiveness and results, a key step in obtaining resources to maintain and expand 11   training. The New Jersey Personnel Department, for example, has established a Human Resource Development Institute to provide training to state agencies and local governments. In addition to providing direct training, the Institute offers distance learning through teleconferencing, and self-paced learning though CD ROM and the Internet. The Institute evaluates training effectiveness several ways. Participants' immediate reactions to training are evaluated through surveys that are entered into a central database, which is used to evaluate statewide training effectiveness. In addition, the Institute uses pre- and post-tests to evaluate what participants learn. Phoenix has a more aggressive training evaluation strategy that attempts to link employee training to citizen satisfaction with city government services. Phoenix evaluates the effectiveness of the city's more than 150 courses four ways:  Participant evaluations at the end of each class  Employee focus sessions that assess how training is being used on the job and how training can be improved  Statistically reliable surveys that, among other things, ask employees to evaluate whether they have received the training they need for their jobs  Statistically reliable surveys of citizens' opinions of city government, including satisfaction with city government services Although the citizen surveys are not a direct measure of training effectiveness, city leaders believe that citizen satisfaction with city government is a reflection, in part, of how well city employees are trained. Enhancing Labor-Management Cooperation Labor-management relations is a critical human resource function in almost every organization. In government, cooperation between organized labor and management is critical because, unlike the private sector, union membership continues to increase. Specifically, by 2000, union membership in the public sector had grown to over 38 percent of all employees, while union membership in the private sector had declined to only 9 percent. Therefore, in order to be effective, government must establish and maintain cooperative relationships with unions. In some public sector jurisdictions, labor and management have recognized this imperative and are working to improve cooperation. Even in jurisdictions that do not have unions, management has recognized the need to establish cooperative partnerships with employees. One approach to improve labor-management cooperation is to reform the employee grievance process in order to make it less adversarial and more timely. For example, Ohio, in cooperation with the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, has successfully implemented a ""nontraditional arbitration"" program to handle employee grievances. In this process, both parties submit information to an independent arbitrator who quickly reaches a binding decision. Arbitrators can hear up to forty cases in a single day. This process is faster, more informal and less adversarial than the traditional multi-step grievance process. The union and employees support the expedited process because it is fast and efficient and produces timely decisions supported by clear rationales. The Ohio Human Resources Division estimates that the expedited grievance process saves the state more than 4,000 work hours each year.  12   In South Carolina, state government has also implemented alternative dispute resolution techniques to reform the employee grievance process. The Office of Human Resources now uses mediators at the beginning of the grievance process instead of holding a formal arbitration conference or grievance hearing. This change has replaced the costly and lengthy grievance process with a non-confrontational forum for problem-solving. In the first year of the new process, over 72 percent of mediations produced a signed agreement that avoided a formal grievance hearing (Lavigna, 2001). In Wisconsin, a key element of the strategy to reform the state's HRM system is the cooperative relationship state government has forged with labor unions, particularly the 27,000 member Wisconsin State Employees Union (WSEU). In 1991, Wisconsin became the first state to use a cooperative approach--""consensus bargaining""--to reach agreement with a large union. The consensus approach, which emphasizes cooperation and problem solving instead of confrontation, is based on the principle that labor and management have complementary, and not competing, interests. A fundamental distinction in consensus bargaining is the difference between ""positions"" and ""interests."" A position--each side's solution to a problem--has traditionally been the starting point for bargaining. An interest, on the other hand, is a basic need or concern. Because consensus bargaining focuses on interests and not positions, bargainers attempt to identify the best approaches to meet both parties' needs without dealing with predetermined, hard-and-fast positions. Since the first time Wisconsin used consensus bargaining in 1991, the state and the WSEU have reached agreement on six biennial contracts using this approach. State and union representatives agree that the problem-solving approach has created more cooperative labor-management relations. For example, 83 percent of union members ratified the first consensus agreement in 1991. Union members have ratified subsequent agreements with similar majorities. Before consensus bargaining, union rank-and-file often approved agreements by slim majorities even after lengthy negotiations. Consensus bargaining has also saved time. In 1991, the state and the union reached agreement in a then-record four and one-half months. More recently, negotiations were completed even faster--in only two months. The consensus process has been particularly effective in shaping contract language on issues other than compensation. For example, one contract change enables employees with attendance problems to use leave instead of being suspended without pay. The employee continues to work but gives up an equal amount of leave time, thus avoiding a loss of pay. Other creative provisions that have been negotiated through consensus include:    A provision allowing workers who transfer to new jobs in state government to return to their former jobs within a few days if the new position is not working out A ""catastrophic leave"" program that allows employees to donate unused vacation or personal leave to co-workers who have health problems that could lead to loss of income Joint labor-management committees to review issues such as union access to new technology  13   In addition, hundreds of grievances have been resolved at the bargaining table. During negotiations for one contract, for example, over 400 grievances were resolved during bargaining (Lavigna, 2001). A recent labor-management project called ""working together"" identified and replicated ""best practices"" in labor-management cooperation across Wisconsin's state government. These best practices included allowing labor representatives to participate in hiring decisions, designing more positive ways to discipline employees, involving employees in developing fairer work schedules for around-the-clock operations, reducing excessive absenteeism and sick leave use, creating self-directed work teams, and improving labormanagement communication. HOW CAN LASTING HUMAN RESOURCE REFORM BE ACHIEVED? There is great momentum across the nation for innovation and change in government personnel and human resource systems. As described in this chapter, some public sector organizations are making progress creating more timely, responsive and flexible systems. In hiring, these organizations are amending civil service laws to make them more flexible, expanding recruiting, developing more user-friendly alternatives to written civil service exams, and using technology to improve system access and efficiency. In classification and compensation, public sector agencies are reducing classification system complexity and adopting more flexible, performance-based pay systems. Government organizations are diversifying their work forces by expanding recruiting, systematically evaluating barriers to diversity, and making managers accountable for diversity. In training, some government organizations are expanding training programs, linking training to key employee competencies, and adopting new approaches to evaluate training effectiveness and results. Finally, public sector jurisdictions are working with labor unions to reduce conflict and increase cooperation. Despite these notable advances, personnel reform is too often still a reality, personnel departments must hiding behind rules and procedures their turf. and many others not discussed here, large-scale goal rather than a reality. To move from rhetoric to embrace change, without reacting defensively, without (""we've always done it that way""), or trying to protect  Lasting HR reform will not be achieved solely in the name of efficiency, because government is not exclusively in the efficiency business. Some reformers believe that efficiency can be achieved by eliminating civil service systems. To the contrary, it is not necessary to ""repeal"" merit systems to improve public sector HRM performance. Instead, in the best case, public sector human resource practices that have outlived their usefulness must be improved. These practices--including arbitrary limits on the number of qualified candidates who can be interviewed, written exams for all jobs, pay solely for longevity, and endless grievance procedures--can be reformed without eliminating merit systems entirely. As more and more government jurisdictions are demonstrating, it is possible to create lasting HRM reform that improves service and responsiveness but still retains the fundamental principles and best features of civil service, such as merit hiring and removal for just cause. The challenge for personnel reform is to change responsively, but also responsibly. To do this, government must involve its many customers and stakeholders in the change process, always striving to reconcile the often conflicting demands of these  14   stakeholders. If these demands are ignored, reinvention efforts will fail. government is far too important to let that happen.  Reforming  15   REFERENCES GORE, A. 1993.

[  Return To Table Of Contents  ]           September 13, 2001:  Delays in Grant Applications  Submission and Other NIH Activities  The tragic events of September 11 will  have many effects on operations at universities and research institutions, as  well as the NIH. The NIH realizes that this may cause problems for investigators  who are planning to submit grant applications. Applications that are submitted  late should include a cover letter noting the reasons for the delay. It is not  necessary to get permission in advance for such delays in grant application submission.  For most applicants a reasonable delay will be until normal communication and  delivery processes are functioning. For applicants in New York City, it is expected  that the delays may be considerably longer. Since there are still many uncertainties  at this time, it is difficult to give further guidance. As more information becomes  available, additional notices will be posted in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts.   Individuals who were scheduled to come to NIH for review or other meetings should check  with the Scientific Review Administrator or responsible Federal official about any changes.   This was also announced in the  NIH  Guide Notice of September 19, 2001 .    [  Return To Table Of Contents  ]          August 17, 2001 (updated August 27, 2001):  NIH Funding of Research Using Specified Existing Human Embryonic Stem Cells   In accordance with the President's announcement of August 9, 2001, ( http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2001/od-09.htm ), the National Institutes of Health is initiating a process to enable researchers to use Federal funds to conduct research using human embryonic stem cells as long as the derivation process (which begins with the destruction of the embryo) was initiated prior to 9:00 p.m. EDT on August 9, and the following criteria are met: the stem cells must have been derived from an embryo that was created for reproductive purposes and was no longer needed; informed consent must have been obtained for donation of the embryo; and that donation must not have involved financial inducements. The President's complete remarks and related information are available at  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html .     Investigators may not conduct research on any human embryonic stem cells until the NIH issues the policies and the procedures that will enable researchers and their institutions to document adherence to the criteria established by the President for use of these cells with Federal funds (direct and F&A). NIH has issued an update on existing human embryonic stem cells that can be found at  http://www.nih.gov/news/stemcell/082701list.htm .    In order to facilitate research using human embryonic stem cells, the NIH is creating a Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry that will list the human embryonic stem cells that meet the eligibility criteria. Specifically, the laboratories or companies that derived the cells listed on the Registry will have provided a signed assurance that the derivation process was initiated prior to 9:00 p.m. EDT on August 9, 2001; the stem cells were derived from an embryo that was created for reproductive purposes and was no longer needed; informed consent was obtained for donation of the embryo; and that donation did not involve financial inducements. The Registry will be accessible to investigators on the NIH Home Page  http://www.nih.gov .    Initially, the Registry will contain basic information about the cells. This information will include a unique identifier; the name of the company or laboratory that derived the cells; contact information for the company/laboratory; and an assurance that the cells meet the President's criteria. In the future, to further assist researchers, additional information may also be included in the Registry, such as details about the derivation of the cells, the number of passages, culture conditions, and growth characteristics; a description of efforts to characterize the cells, including molecular markers and evidence of pluripotency; relevant publications; DNA fingerprinting data; and quality assurance data, such as the results of tests for  Mycoplasma  and standard human pathogens.    The NIH is working expeditiously to ensure that the Registry will be operational as soon as possible. General questions or comments about the Registry should be addressed to  stemcellregistry@od.nih.gov . Researchers who are interested in studying or using particular human embryonic stem cells in their research will be expected to contact the company/laboratory directly to arrange for access to these cells. Investigators should be aware that, in some cases, existing cells need to be expanded in culture to reach larger numbers for the purposes of distribution, and that, in other cases, the derivations are still in the early stages of characterization and, thus, may not be immediately available.    With regard to the funding of research on both embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells in humans and animals, the NIH welcomes investigator-initiated grant applications proposing research using such stem cells, including requests to use existing funds or for supplements to existing grants to conduct such research. The NIH is also exploring a number of initiatives to facilitate research on all forms of stem cells. To hasten the development of a program of research and to stimulate submission of grant applications in this arena, some Institutes and Centers will be issuing Program Announcements to describe new, continuing, or expanded interests relevant to stem cell research, such as new approaches to the characterization of stem cells or the development of methods to differentiate cells into specific somatic cells for study. Other Institutes and Centers may issue specific Requests for Applications, which invite grant applications, include a special receipt date, and a set-aside of funds. Another possibility may be provision of resources (using contract or other mechanisms), in order to ensure adequate production of cells, means for their distribution, and adequate training of researchers as to how to maintain the cells. As usual, further updates and all solicitations will appear in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts that is available online at  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/index.html .    This was also announced in the  NIH Guide Notice of August 27, 2001 .

Completing this module fulfills the NIH education requirement in the protection of human research participants for key personnel  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html ).  This education module was initiated in January 2001 and can be accessed at the following URL:   http://cme.cancer.gov/c01/ .  Before developing this module specifically for extramural scientists, the NIH made available an on-line course that was designed for our intramural investigators.  At this time, however, we strongly encourage extramural investigators to use the extramural module if they choose to complete an NIH course.  Also see the  September 5, 2001 NIH Guide Notice  for additional information.

NIH will consider requests for administrative supplements for extensions in time that include personnel costs, and replacement of equipment, supplies and unique resources damaged or lost as a result of the storm.  These requests should be submitted using the PHS-398 face page, budget page, and budget justification page.  The application should state that the requested support does not represent a duplication of benefits, e.g., from insurance.  The request should be sent to the Grants Management Officer at the funding Institute or Center that is responsible for that grant.  (The supplemental package should not be sent to the Center for Scientific Review.)  NIH will also continue to accept applications that were intended for the July 1 receipt date. Applications delayed due to flooding should include a cover letter noting the reason for the delay.   It is not necessary to get advance permission for a delayed submission. This has also been announced in the  06/22/2001 NIH Guide Notice .

The NIH realizes that this may cause problems for investigators who are planning to submit grant applications (both competing and non-competing) for the July 1 receipt date.  Applications that are submitted late because of Tropical Storm Allison should include a cover letter noting the reasons for the delay.  It is not necessary to get permission in advance for weather-related delays in grant application submission.  In addition, Principal Investigators and Program Officials who have experienced damage or losses to their research are encouraged to contact their Program Official about these losses. This has also been announced in the  06/13/2001 NIH Guide Notice  and revised in the  06/21/2001 NIH Guide Notice  to permit late applications from all applicants and grantees affected by Tropical Storm Allison. NIH will publish a follow-up announcement on resources available to NIH grantees and contractors. (See follow-up  06/22/2001 NIH Guide Notice ).

GX005-27-9644812	you are here:   Presidential  Management  Internships                                                            Informed decisions require good data. The Census Bureau provides just that -- timely, relevant and quality data about the people and the economy of the United States.  The Census Bureau has been making the front page -- and the editorial pages --  quite frequently since we released our state population figures from Census 2000. And right now we are releasing data which will determine legislative districts in each state, as well as data on the racial and ethnic diversity of the Nation.   However, the Census Bureau does so much more than conduct the Decennial census. We perform eight censuses on economic entities and governments every five years. We also carry out more than 200 hundred demographic and economic surveys on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Taken together, these surveys provide us with current data on such topics as unemployment, business productivity, poverty, and health insurance. These data have profound impact on policy formation, evaluation, and decision making in both the public and private sector.   The Census Bureau is hiring Presidential Management Interns (PMIs) to work and learn about a variety of general and technical fields. For PMIs interested in administration, we are offering the following positions: Policy Analyst, Program Analyst, Budget Analyst, Computer Specialist, and Accountant. For PMIs interested in specific subjects, we are offering the following positions: Survey Statistician, Mathematical Statistician, Social Science Analyst, and Usability Researcher.   Rotational opportunities throughout the Bureau and the Federal Government can round-out your experience. Consider joining our ranks and help us carry out our diverse work.   The Bureau has a strong commitment to training and professional development. Current PMIs at the Bureau enjoy the support and guidance of high-level employees. PMIs present their research at conferences, receive graduate training at area universities, and take advantage of on-site courses.   The Census Bureau is located two miles outside Washington, D.C. The new Suitland Metrorail station, adjacent to Suitland Federal Center, provides convenient access to downtown. The Bureau also offers free parking, an on-site fitness center, and alternative work schedules.   Informally, the Census Bureau is a place where PMIs enjoy learning from each other through a growing Census PMI network. Both current and former PMIs work in varied positions throughout the Bureau. Feel free to contact them about their work. Senior managers will be interviewing candidates at the job fair, and interested candidates are encouraged to contact  Donna.Yee@census.gov ,  PMI Census Bureau coordinator, for more information and to schedule interviews.

These costs, including tips not to exceed 15%, are not included in the per diem rate and are claimed separately                                                          on the travel voucher. In the interest of economy, subways, buses or limousines should be used in lieu of taxis wherever possible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Travelers can be reimbursed for the use of privately-owned automobiles (POA) from residence or office to airport or train                                                          station and return, in lieu of local transportation, if the cost of mileage and parking fees, if any, do not exceed cost by                                                          commercial means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Travel by POA can be allowed if it is advantageous to the Government. Examples of being advantageous to the Government are:                                                          the cost of round-trip mileage being less than round-trip air fare, and several travelers traveling in one automobile. If                                                          the employee wants to travel by automobile for personal convenience, and commercial travel would cost less, the traveler must                                                          claim the cost of the round-trip fare plus any other transportation costs, not the actual cost of mileage by POA.

Each traveler is responsible for maintaining                                                          a diary of the expenses incurred during each trip. At the end of the month the SF-1012 will be completed showing the expenses                                                          for each trip. See paragraphs (3)(a) and (b) below for approval procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          When the travel voucher is filed, any monies due the traveler must be first applied to the advance of funds, if an advance                                                          was received. If any monies remain outstanding, that amount can be repaid by personal check or remain outstanding and applied                                                          to the next trip if another trip is anticipated during the month. No advance should remain outstanding more than 30 days.

Where a carrier only permits one frequent flyer account per person, the traveler is responsible                                                          for retaining account records and supporting documentation to establish which credits are attributable to personal travel                                                          and official travel, respectively. If the traveler lacks such documentation, then all accrued points/credits are considered                                                          the property of the Government and may not be used for personal travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While mileage credits belong to the Federal Government, airlines record ownership of the credits to the traveler.

APPENDIX I CENSUS BUREAU'S RESPONSE TO DRAFT AUDIT REPORT  Page i 1 1 3  3 5 6 7 8 11 11 13 14 15 15 16 17 18 18 19  20 20 21 21   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The Bureau of the Census is mandated by the U.S. Constitution to provide the population counts needed to reapportion the House of Representatives every 10 years. The bureau fulfills this mandate by performing a decennial census. Before each decennial census, the bureau performs a dress rehearsal of planned operations, systems, procedures, and workflow. The 1998 Dress Rehearsal is designed to be the bureau's major test of all previously tested and some untested operations. The bureau is performing its dress rehearsals at Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. The purpose of our review was to assess the administrative practices related to personnel at the Sacramento dress rehearsal. We observed administrative processes, interviewed staff, and evaluated documents at both the Seattle Regional Census Center and the Sacramento Local Census Office. Overall, we found that the administrative procedures were in compliance with Census guidelines, and were meeting the goals and objectives of the dress rehearsal. Our review did identify the need for some improvements in the following areas: l Recruiting/screening/hiring achieved goals, but some procedures need improvement.  Census estimated that the Sacramento dress rehearsal would require a pool of approximately 7,000 candidates. We found that the recruiting/screening/hiring procedures achieved the desired goals and objectives. The procedures at Sacramento resulted in an acceptable pool of candidates, the necessary numbers of workers were screened and hired, and overall the workforce was qualified and adequate for the required tasks. We did identify some internal controls related to verification procedures of applicants' prior employment and foreign language capabilities that need improvement. (See page 3.) l Payroll processing needs to be improved. The dress rehearsal disclosed several problems  in the Sacramento office's payroll processing system. The most serious problem is that the system accepts, processes, and pays employees who submit duplicate time sheets. We also found that documentation of employee time spent on training, overtime, and travel was not in compliance with Census procedures. In addition, the VISA check program needs additional clarification and guidance to eliminate unauthorized uses and correct errors and omissions. (See page 8.) l Supplemental Payment Process was slow and confusing. The supplemental payment  process is an employee incentive program that rewards field staff for achieving and maintaining a minimum productivity level in completing questionnaires. The process was not well understood by regional or local census staff, payments to field staff were slow and may not have been accurate, and quality control procedures were not being completely implemented. Consequently, the benefits of incentive pay may be lost. Problems with the computer system and unclear instructions and direction were identified as causing the process to operate inefficiently. (See page 14.) i   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  l Employee evaluations were not done. Employee evaluations were not conducted for  individuals employed in the Sacramento dress rehearsal. The Sacramento office hired about 900 employees during the dress rehearsal. Many employees worked in several Census operations during the dress rehearsal and will have the opportunity to be rehired for operations during the decennial census. However, because the local office did not complete employee evaluations, the bureau cannot easily identify which terminated employees should be rehired and which ones should not. We found that supervisors and managers were informally gathering lists of possible rehires. Census has the forms and database to formalize the process so that trained, experienced, and productive personnel can be identified for rehire. Another important reason for having accurate and complete information on employee terminations is to be able to adequately handle, and where appropriate, refute, unemployment claims. (See page 17.) l Policies and procedures need to be documented and organized. Many administrative  decisions, instructions, and procedures related to the Sacramento dress rehearsal were communicated orally, and were not organized and documented as required by sound management practices. We found at the Seattle regional center that documentation of policies and procedures was not well organized or up to date. We found that documentation at the Sacramento local office was generally adequate except for orally transmitted instructions and directives. (See page 20.) Our recommendations are on pages 5, 11, 15, 18, and 20. In response to the draft audit report, Census officials generally concurred with our recommendations, indicated that the recommendations had been resolved, or identified a reasonable alternative course of action. We commend the Bureau for its prompt and positive responses to our recommendations. However, the bureau did not concur with our recommendations regarding performance evaluations. After carefully considering the bureau's comments, we reaffirm those recommendations. We have summarized the bureau's responses and have provided our comments after the appropriate sections of this report. We have included the bureau's complete response as Appendix I.  ii   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General INTRODUCTION  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  The Bureau of the Census is mandated by the U.S. Constitution to provide the population counts needed to reapportion the House of Representatives every 10 years. The bureau fulfills this mandate by performing a decennial census, the nation's largest statistical data-gathering program, which provides data that affects governments, businesses, and private citizens. Prior to each decennial census, the bureau traditionally performs a dress rehearsal of planned operations, systems, procedures, and workflow. Although the bureau tested some planned Census 2000 operations in 1995 and 1996, the 1998 dress rehearsal is designed to be the bureau's major test of all previously tested and some untested operations. The bureau is performing its dress rehearsals at Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and the Menominee Indian Reservation in Keshena, Wisconsin. This report discusses our review of administrative procedures during the Sacramento dress rehearsal. PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of our audit was to assess the administrative practices related to personnel at the Sacramento dress rehearsal. We observed administrative processes, interviewed staff, and evaluated documents at both the Seattle Regional Census Center and the Sacramento Local Census Office. We performed our on-site field work from March 16 to July 9, 1998, at the census dress rehearsal sites in Seattle and Sacramento. Our review evaluated processes used throughout the dress rehearsal period. At the Seattle regional center, we interviewed personnel about procedures, practices, policies, and rationales for actions. We reviewed background documents, and analyzed census organization and the dress rehearsal processes. At the Sacramento local office, we reviewed the internal controls relating to the personnel management system, recruiting, hiring, training, payroll, travel and miscellaneous expense reimbursement. We found weaknesses in the internal controls and administrative management processes as discussed in the Findings and Recommendations section of our report. In conducting our review, we relied on computer-processed data contained in the bureau's PAMS/ADAMS (Pre-application Administrative Management System/Administrative Decennial Administrative Management System) reports. We verified the accuracy of the data by comparing a sample of Census employee records to the computer data file. Despite finding some minor errors, we concluded that the data was sufficiently reliable for our analysis. We did not evaluate compliance with federal laws and regulations, as our review objective was to assess administrative processes. Our review evaluated compliance with Census and generally accepted administrative and management procedures. With respect to items not tested, nothing  1   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Seattle and Sacramento offices had not complied, in all material respects, with the appropriate provisions. This review was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards and was performed under the authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, and Department Organization Order 10-13, dated May 22, 1980, as amended.  2   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I. RECRUITING/SCREENING/HIRING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED, BUT SOME PROCEDURES NEED IMPROVEMENT  Conducting a census requires large numbers of temporary workers. The bureau estimates that it will need approximately 500,000 temporary employees at the local offices to conduct Census 2000. The temporary workers fill positions as local office managers, enumerators, partnership specialists, media specialists, and clerks. A pool of pre-tested applicants must be available to meet managers believe that 10 applicants must be available for adequate supply of acceptable candidates and to meet the that the Sacramento dress rehearsal would require a pool the temporary hiring demands. Census each expected hire in order to ensure an expected turnover. Census estimated of approximately 7,000 candidates.  We found that the recruiting/screening/hiring procedures during the Sacramento dress rehearsal achieved the desired goals and objectives. The procedures at Sacramento resulted in an acceptable pool of candidates, the necessary numbers of workers were screened and hired, and overall the workforce was qualified and adequate for the required tasks, as indicated by the fact that only a few employees were terminated for misconduct or poor performance. In reviewing the personnel files of the 80 local office employees terminated as of June 3, 1998, we found that 41 were terminated because their six-month period of appointment expired, 20 resigned for personal reasons, 12 resigned for unknown reasons, and only 7 were terminated for poor job performance. Although the local office successfully recruited and screened an adequate pool of candidates and hired the necessary number of workers, we did identify the following internal control and other procedural areas where improvements can be made. Verification Procedures for Applicants Could Be Improved All applicant information is entered in the administrative management database from the Census Employment Inquiry form, which contains 31 questions addressing such matters as prior work experience, background information, language ability, and personal data. Also required is a written, multiple-choice test that measures the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform a variety of Census jobs. When individual test results are obtained, the raw score is penciled onto the application and also entered into the database. The names of all applicants are submitted to Census headquarters for a Decennial Applicant Name Check, which is a criminal background review requiring three to five days to complete. Individuals passing this review become available for hire.  3   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  To evaluate the effectiveness, reliability, and accuracy of the Census employment screening and hiring process, we selected a random sample of 30 employees from a universe of 329 hired by the Sacramento office as of April 21, 1998. For each of these employees, we reviewed the completeness of the application and compared the data entered into the administrative management database with the data on the application. We tested the bureau's compliance with its procedures for verification of prior employment and non-English language skills data shown on the application. We found that applications were generally complete and accurately entered into the database. Errors we found did not negatively affect the qualification of the applicants or their eligibility to be employed, and therefore were considered to be minor procedural errors. For example, three applications did not indicate the individual's raw score for the test, although the management database contained the converted test scores. And, in four instances, data fields in the application were completed, but the respective database fields were blank. The bureau's verification of applicant data was less complete, and not in compliance with established procedures. According to Census procedures, verification of prior employment and language ability is required to be documented in the applicant's selection guideform D-269. Yet, seven of the 30 employee files were missing job selection guides entirely. Other instances of missing verification data included: l Fifteen of the applications did not have evidence that prior employers were contacted.  Determining employee reliability and honesty is essential to achieve a reliable workforce. l Nine of the 10 employees claiming a non-English language capability did not have any  documentation or indication that their language ability was verified. Verifying the foreign language ability of applicants is necessary to ensure that Census questionnaires can be administered to non-English speaking residents, and therefore is essential to achieving a qualified workforce. For those applicants whose employers were contacted, one former employer told the interviewer that the applicant was unreliable and did not show up for work. Another employer confirmed that an applicant had once been employed, but would not be rehired. In another case, an employer could not recall the applicant. In all three cases, the applicants was hired. We believe there was insufficient supervisory review of these three hiring decisions. Only a Few Applicants with Language Skills Were Missed by the Administrative Management Database A major challenge in Sacramento was to recruit sufficient workers with foreign language skills because the dress rehearsal included many neighborhoods where English is not the primary language. Workers with skills in various foreign languages are critical to successfully completing 4   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  census follow-up work in these neighborhoods. We conducted an analysis to test the ability of the administrative management system to generate a complete and accurate list of qualified applicants with language abilities. Our analysis indicated that the system produced an adequate listing of applicants with foreign language skills. Only a few potential candidates were missed by the current procedures. We found that the reasons candidates' language skills were not identified included failures to pass the Decennial Applicant Name Check, errors by the database entry clerks, and instances where the actual language or dialect spoken by the candidate differed from the information keyed into the system. Authorization Access for the Administrative Management System Needs Restriction Another concern is employees' accessibility to the administrative management system. Currently, data processing users have wide access to the Census system. Sacramento managers told us the following problems occurred: changed settings to printers, unauthorized entry to program data panels, unauthorized changes to employee files, changes in payroll records, and unauthorized operation of the reset/reboot and the on/off processing unit buttons. The result of such abuse can lead to inaccurate candidate files, system downtime, and system failures. Recommendations We recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Census ensure that: 1. All applicants' prior employment and foreign language capabilities are verified as required by procedures. 2. Selection guides are completed and included in each applicant's file as required by Census procedures. 3. Applicant hiring decisions are reviewed by supervisors when questions arise regarding the suitability of applicants. 4. Language skills are correctly identified and keyed into the administrative system. 5. Access to the administrative management system databases is better controlled. Agency Response 1. Ensure that all applicants' prior employment and foreign language capabilities are verified as required by procedures. 5   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  The Bureau concurs: The D-517, Testing and Selecting Manual, provides procedures for conducting preemployment reference checks, as well as procedural guidance for evaluating bilingual applicants' English language proficiency when language is determined to be a selective factor by the selecting official. The Census Bureau is in the process of reviewing our procedures for preemployment reference checks, and we will reinforce the importance of following these procedures in a Regional Census Center Administrative Memorandum to all regional directors. 2. Ensure that all selection guides are completed and included in each applicant's files as required by Census procedures. The Bureau concurs: Existing selection guides (D-269A-D) are intended to aid selecting officials in determining which applicants are best qualified for Local Census Office (LCO) positions. The Census Bureau will reinforce the requirement for using selection guides to interview all qualified candidates to ensure selections are made in accordance with merit system principles and EEO guidelines for fair and equitable treatment. The Census Bureau will underscore the importance of this issue and restate the need for management to ensure the inclusion of completed selection guides in applicant files through the issuance of a Regional Census Center (RCC), Administrative Memorandum to be issued to all regional directors. 3. Ensure that applicant-hiring decisions are reviewed by supervisors when questions arise regarding the suitability of applicants. The Bureau concurs: Selection Aid instructions include guidance to selecting clerks on reviewing applications for employment suitability. Procedural guidance provides for a secondlevel review (by supervisory personnel) BEFORE applicants are determined to be unsuitable for hiring. Many factors are considered, including a review of selection interview results, reference checks with previous employers, and successful completion of a criminal history background check. The Field Division recently distributed a Regional Census Center Administrative Memorandum that provides additional guidance on making suitability determinations, including the reviews by higher-level managers, to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all applicants. For Census 2000 operations, the Census Bureau will update the administrative and recruiting office manuals to reflect the additional guidance provided in the memorandum. 4. Ensure that language skills are correctly identified and keyed into the administrative system. The Bureau concurs: All applicants complete the BC-170, Census Employment Inquiry, which asks the applicants to indicate his or her ability to speak a language other than English and to identify the degree of proficiency. Applicant data are keyed and/or scanned into the automated Preemployment Administrative Management System (PAMS). In addition, 6   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  procedural guidance instructs the recruiting assistants to review applications at the time of testing to ensure all items are completed. The Census Bureau will further reinforce this requirement by addressing the importance of the application review process and subsequent data capture of all items in a Regional Census Center Administrative Management Memorandum. 5. Ensure access to the administrative management system databases is better controlled. The Bureau concurs: Currently, access to the PAMS/ADAMS database is controlled by the PAMS/ADAMS staff at headquarters. The Regional Census Center Automation Supervisor is responsible for coordinating all requests for user identification with the headquarters staff. For Census 2000, we are implementing internal auditing procedures that will track all changes in the PAMS/ADAMS to the user level to ensure accountability for all personnel and payroll transactions. The Field division will update the D-581, PAMS/ADAMS Operating Guide, to include the user classes with appropriate controls when determining user classifications. OIG Comments We commend the Bureau for initiating actions to address our recommendations. The actions taken, in process, or planned will adequately address the recommendations.  7   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General II.  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  PAYROLL PROCESSING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED  The dress rehearsal disclosed several problems in the local office's payroll processing system. The most serious problem is that the system accepts, processes, and pays employees who submit duplicate time sheets. As currently designed, the automated administrative management system does not identify duplicate payments. Also, having audit clerks reviewing each payroll form did not identify the duplicate payments, and is not cost effective. Our review of payroll processing also found that documentation of employee time spent in training, overtime, and travel was not in compliance with Census procedures. In addition, the VISA check program needs additional clarification and guidance to eliminate unauthorized uses and correct errors and omissions. Administrative Management System Allows Duplicate Payroll and Expense Payments The administrative management system is programmed to identify and trigger an error message if employees submit time sheets totaling more than 8 hours per day or 40 hours per week. However, the system is not programmed to identify employees who submit duplicate or overlapping time sheets totaling less than these figures. During the dress rehearsal, the Sacramento administrative staff detected duplicate time sheets during routine filing of original time and attendance forms. The local managers initiated a manual review of all time sheets to determine the extent of the problem. The review found 121 instances of duplicate and overlapping employee time sheets totaling $1,672. The duplicate time sheets were created when employees were reassigned to different geographic areas or tasks and different crew leaders during the same day. The daily time sheet form (D-308) provides only one data field for each geographic area and task. Rather than allocating the hours worked to the different areas or tasks, employees submitted more than one time sheet, sometimes with overlapping hours for different areas or tasks. The different time sheets were then signed by different crew leaders and submitted for processing. Payroll Audit Function Did Not Identify Duplicate Payments Sacramento audit clerks reviewed substantially all of the daily payroll forms. This function did not identify the duplicate payments discussed above. We reviewed the daily payroll forms for our sample of 30 employees. Most errors corrected by the audit clerks were changes in the number of hours worked based on the auditor clerk's review of the beginning and ending times reported on the form. The beginning and ending times reported are not entered into the employee database. In our opinion, more cost effective checks could be obtained by modifying the management system with an additional edit check to compare beginning and ending times with the hours submitted on the form. 8   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General Payroll Records Need Better Support for Time and Costs  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  The processing of daily employee payroll time sheets appeared to be adequate except for minor errors and omissions. However, our review of time sheets for a sample of 30 employees showed that documentation of employee time spent in training, overtime, and travel costs was not in compliance with Census procedures. Complete training records were not kept by the Sacramento office or the Seattle regional office. The 30 employees reviewed allocated a total of 984 hours to training, but only 570 (58 percent) of the hours could be verified by available training records. The other 414 hours (42 percent) were unverified and totaled about $3,500 of personnel cost (414 hours multiplied by $8.50, an enumerator's starting hourly wage). Census personnel procedures require that employees be paid accurately, which requires adequate support for time reported. The records to support training provided by the Sacramento office consisted of training class attendance lists, dates, locations, and instructors. Rosters for training held at the beginning of the dress rehearsal period appear to be the most incomplete, possibly because of the high turnover rate among recruiting staff. Authorization for employee overtime was not documented in most instances. Our review found that 66 percent (82 of 124 hours) of overtime was processed and paid even though it had not been authorized or documented by an approved Overtime Authorization (Form CD-81). Census procedures require that the CD-81 be approved before overtime is incurred. The undocumented/unauthorized overtime hours are estimated to cost about $1,055 (82.75 hours multiplied by $12.75, an enumerator's hourly overtime wage rate). Also, Census guidelines require that travel expenses over $5 be supported by receipts. However, our review showed that only about 40 percent of the travel expenses exceeding $5 were supported by receipts. VISA Check Program Not Complying with Procedures The purpose of the VISA check program is to provide advances so that employees can travel to training or their initial work location. Our review of the program during the dress rehearsal found several instances of non-compliance with established procedures. At the time of our review, 206 VISA checks had been issued with a total value of $17,875, for an average of about $87 a check. Nineteen checks had been returned and voided. Program guidance in the administrative management system's manual states that all employees are eligible to receive an advance, including clerks. The checks are limited to an amount equal to six hours of pay, which for Sacramento would be $75 for enumerators. The checks are completed by the local office 9   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  Assistant Manager for Administration and authorized by the local Office Manager. A hand-written check register, maintained by the Assistant Manager, contains the information stipulated by the manual--check number, issue date, employee name, social security number, check amount, and comments. A check receipt log recording the employee name, check amount, date of receipt, and employee signature is obtained to document check disbursement. We examined the security and storage of unissued checks, reviewed the procedures for check issuance and receipt, and reconciled the checks written and cashed. Generally, we found the program followed established procedures. However, we also identified the following instances of noncompliance with procedures: l Some VISA checks were issued to employees because their payroll checks were late. In 36  instances, VISA checks were issued due to late payroll in amounts of $100, and one employee received three $100 checks at the same time. No written documentation authorizing either the additional purpose or the larger amounts was available. The Assistant Manager for Administration stated that oral authorization for these actions was obtained from the regional census center. l Some checks could not be accounted for. Three of the 19 checks returned could not be  independently verified as being voided. According to the Assistant Manager, the three checks were voided and destroyed in compliance with the manual instructions. The other 16 were voided and retained with the copies of the checks at the request of the Sacramento manager. The administrative management system's manual states that checks not issued should be voided, destroyed, and disposed of. However, we believe that disposing of unissued checks prevents full verification and accountability for all checks. l Some checks were issued without using proper procedures, thereby increasing the risk of  misappropriation or misuse of funds and potentially limiting recovery of funds. Of the 206 checks issued, the check receipt log was improperly completed in 15 instances as follows: No employee signature was obtained (4 instances); individuals other than the employees were allowed to sign for receipt of the check (4 instances); the signature did not resemble the name of the employee (1 instance); the check number listed on the check receipt log was incorrect (4 instances); and instead of the receipt log being used, the employees certified receipt on separate pieces of paper, which could be more easily lost or misplaced (2 instances). Recommendations We recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Census ensure that: 1. The daily time sheet (Form D-308) be modified so that time worked by an employee in multiple assignment areas on a single day can be recorded on one form.  10   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  2. The automated pay system (ADAMS) be modified so that multiple daily time sheets for an employee are flagged on an exception report for review and validation by an appropriate official. 3. Complete training records are kept so that Census can compare the attendance records with the daily payroll sheets. 4. Procedures be modified so that managers have an option to either give advanced written approval for overtime or approve a limited amount of overtime, after the fact, when an employee can adequately document that advance approval was not practical and that the overtime was necessary and the most efficient use of government funds for accomplishing an assigned task.  5. Census does not reimburse employees for expenses over $5 if receipts are not attached to payroll forms. 6. Specific procedures be published to require that all parts of a check be completed when issued, and that distribution of the checks be adequately controlled and safeguarded, which includes maintaining a check register. Agency Response 1. Ensure that the daily time sheet (Form D-308) is modified so that time worked by an employee in multiple assignment areas on a single day can be recorded on one form. Problem resolved: The Census Bureau has lifted the requirement that enumerators submit multiple time sheets for multiple assignments. In Census 2000, enumerators will submit one time sheet for the entire workday. 2. Ensure that the automated pay systems (ADAMS) be modified so that multiple daily time sheets for an employee are flagged on an exception report for review and validation by an appropriate official. The Bureau concurs: The Census Bureau will review current procedures and system requirements needed to develop an edit that will identify multiple and/or duplicate time sheets submitted for the same day and generate an exception list for review by appropriate payroll/personnel staff. 3. Ensure that complete training records are kept so that Census can compare the attendance records with the daily payroll sheets. The Bureau agrees that the issue is important, but believes it is better addressed through the following: The current system already includes a built-in check that ties actual training 11   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  participation of selected employees to the payroll process and ensures that selected employees who are paid for training activities actually reported to training. Procedures have been implemented to address this concern. The Census Bureau has made modifications to PAMS to require the automated creation of the D-275, Record of Training, when applicants are selected for positions. The D-275 is printed and attached to the appointment folders for use by the trainers (Crew Leaders). Trainers are instructed to indicate the applicant's status on the D-275 (that is, whether or not the applicant showed up for training). The daily pay and work record (D-308) will not be accepted unless the selectee attended training and the Trainer/Crew Leader has signed the D-308. The D-275 is used to update the applicant's status in the PAMS/ADAMS system, and without the status being updated daily, pay sheets are not accepted. 4. Ensure that procedures are modified so that managers have an option to either give advanced written approval for overtime or approve a limited amount of overtime, after the fact, when an employee can adequately document that advance approval was not practical and that the overtime was necessary and the most efficient use of government funds for accomplishing an assigned task. The Bureau concurs: The Census Bureau will send a Regional Census Center Administrative Management Memorandum to the regional directors documenting the existing overtime procedures. Overtime can be approved verbally in advance by the Area Managers, and followed up with written approval on Form CD-81, Request for Authorization of Overtime and Compensatory Hours, by the regional director or the assistant regional census manager. The Census Bureau will provide enough flexibility at the regional level to approve a limited amount of overtime after the fact, as justified, on a case-by-case basis. However, the Census Bureau is not inclined to establish a broad policy on this issue due to the large numbers of employees expected to be hired for Census 2000, and the opportunities such a policy would create for fraud and abuse. 5. Ensure that Census does not reimburse employees for expenses over $5 if receipts are not attached to payroll forms. The Bureau concurs: Currently, Census Bureau auditing procedures require clerks to disallow claims over $5 if receipts are not attached. For Census 2000, the Census Bureau will modify the ADAMS to give a warning message to data entry clerks who key in the amount of reimbursements to remind them of the documentation requirement. In addition, the Census Bureau will reemphasize this requirement in a Regional Census Center Administrative Memorandum to the regional directors.  12   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  6. Ensure that specific procedures be published to require that all parts of a check be completed when issued, and that distribution be adequately controlled and safeguarded, which includes maintaining a check register. Problem resolved: For Census 2000 address listing, the Census Bureau has canceled the use of the VISA check program and replaced the VISA checks with American Express Travelers Checks. The Census Bureau has issued revised program guidance and implementation instructions in a Regional Census Center Administrative Memorandum to all regional directors. Administrative control procedures are in place that include safeguarding checks in a locked safe with controlled and limited access, control registers that identify travelers checks serial numbers, date of issuance, and signature of employee (certifying the receipt of the check). The Field Division's Decennial Personnel/Payroll staff at headquarters, along with the Finance Division, are monitoring the issuance of the checks , as well as reviewing weekly payroll deduction registers produced by the ADAMS to ensure the deductions are being made by Regional Census Center (RCC) administrative staff. OIG Comments We commend the Bureau for initiating actions to adequately address our recommendations. The actions taken, in process, or planned will adequately address recommendations #2-6. With respect to recommendation #1, implementation of that recommendation would enable the bureau to continue its previous method of tracking each assignment's work area. However, we defer to Census officials' judgment in lifting the requirement for enumerators to submit multiple time sheets for multiple assignments. Therefore, it will not be necessary for the bureau's audit action plan prepared in response to this final report to address recommendation #1.  13   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General III.  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PROCESS WAS SLOW AND CONFUSING  The Supplemental Payment Process is an employee incentive program that rewards field staff for achieving and maintaining a minimum productivity level for completing questionnaires. The process was not well understood by regional or local census staff, payments to field staff may not have been accurate and were slow in being made, and quality control procedures were not being completely implemented. Many of the benefits of incentive pay may be lost because payments are slow in being made, employee eligibility is not being accurately determined, and the accurate amounts of payments cannot be verified. Problems with the computer system and unclear direction were identified as causing the process to run inefficiently. Supplemental bonus payments are available for the non-response follow-up operation and are payable on a weekly production basis and on a one-time basis for the entire period of the operation. Employees eligible for the weekly payment must complete all assignments, maintain a minimum production rate of 1.75 cases per hour, remain available for additional assignments, pass an internal quality review, and work at least six hours on the weekend. For example, for meeting the weekly bonus criteria, an enumerator will receive a weekly bonus of $1.00 for each questionnaire correctly completed. The end of the operation bonus payment requires enumerators to work an average of six hours per available weekend during the period of non-response followup, and maintain an average productivity level of at least 1.75 cases per hour over the period. The bonus pay for meeting this criteria is $1.35 for each correctly completed questionnaire. The staff at the Sacramento office and the Seattle regional center were unsure as to whether the process was operating as intended. Neither regional nor local Census officials could clearly explain and demonstrate how the process should work. They also lacked confidence in the accuracy of the list and could not verify the accuracy of the bonus amounts for individuals listed on the supplemental payment report. The officials attributed their lack of confidence to program weaknesses and software errors, such as weekend hours being incorrectly identified and computed. The process's internal quality review consists of a computer analysis of the submitted questionnaires and a more extensive manual review by a local operations supervisor of questionable cases, which are flagged by computer analysis. All questionable cases should be deducted from an employee's weekly and total production quantities. We found that the quality reviews were being conducted but questionable cases were not being deducted from employee production levels. The local operations staff stated that they were instructed by Census headquarters to not reduce employee productivity levels for questionable cases, thereby potentially allowing employees to be paid for false productivity levels. In its July 7, 1998, supplemental payment report, Census listed 351 employees at the Sacramento office as being eligible for supplemental pay: 316 enumerators eligible for the weekly bonus pay, and 9 clerical staff and 26 enumerators eligible for the end-of-operation bonus. However, the Assistant Manager for Administration deemed the report inaccurate because a low number of weekend hours was cited as worked during the report period, and the period covered eight days. 14   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  To verify the accuracy of the report, Sacramento staff were manually reviewing the daily production reports for all 630 enumerators. Our review of a random sample of 25 local office employees included 11 enumerators who qualified for the weekly bonus during the non-response follow-up. As of July 14, 1998 (18 days after the follow-up had ended), only 2 of 11 enumerators identified as being eligible had actually received bonus payments. Recommendations We recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Census ensure that: 1. Problems with the administrative management system are resolved so that supplemental payments are issued promptly and accurately. 2. Policies and procedures on supplemental pay are clarified and disseminated to all managers and employees, including thorough definitions of the criteria for completing all assignments. 3. All supplemental payment criteria are applied, including quality control reviews. 4. Reliable supplemental payment reports are issued to the regional centers and local offices, including listing qualified applicants, the amounts they should be paid, and the amounts they have been paid. Agency Response 1. Ensure that problems with the administrative management system are resolved so that supplemental payments are issued promptly and accurately. The Bureau concurs: The Census Bureau will establish a ""Supplemental Pay Work Group"" consisting of Dress Rehearsal administrative staff, field staff, and Decennial Management Division staff to review all issues related to supplemental pay, policies, and procedures, and to develop recommendations regarding the future of the Census 2000 Supplemental Pay program. 2.

OIG Comments We commend the Bureau for identifying actions to address our recommendations. The actions planned will, if implemented, adequately address recommendations #2-4. However, with respect to recommendation #1, while the Census response states the actions to be taken for Census 2000, it does not mention any efforts already in place by the bureau to address the specific problems, as described above, encountered during the dress rehearsal. These efforts should be detailed in the bureau's audit action plan prepared in response to this final report.  16   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General IV.  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  EMPLOYEE EVALUATIONS WERE NOT DONE  Employee evaluations have not been performed for individuals employed in the Sacramento dress rehearsal. Productive personnel are being identified and recommended for rehire only on an informal basis, even though Census has the personnel forms and database to produce formal evaluations. Capable, productive employees are necessary to meet the timeliness goals required by Census. To ensure that enough qualified employees are obtained, the bureau strives to recruit 10 applicants for every position to be filled. The Sacramento office recruited about 9,500 applicants and hired about 900. Many of the 900 individuals worked in multiple Census operations during the dress rehearsal and will have the opportunity to be rehired for operations during the decennial census. However, because it is not performing employee evaluations, the bureau cannot identify which terminated employees are capable and productive and therefore should be rehired. Census procedures and forms provide a method for evaluating employee performance on a limited basis. The form D-291, which initiates official personnel actions and is the basis for updating the administrative management database, contains a field that can be used to expand on explanations of personnel actions. At the end of the dress rehearsal, most of the enumerators and many clerical staff were terminated for lack of work. However, Census staff will be recruited for other local offices during decennial operations. In the Sacramento County area, two local offices will be opening for the decennial operation. To reduce organization confusion at the new offices, Census plans to rehire the most capable, knowledgeable and productive staff used in the dress rehearsal for key positions in the new offices. To maximize efficient operations, Census is informally identifying such staff from the dress rehearsal operations for rehire. We reviewed the personnel files of 100 employees to determine whether there was any indication as to which of them should or should not be rehired. Although the D-291 form can accommodate evaluations in the ""Comments"" field, it was not being used. In the 100 files reviewed, only two forms had evaluation comments. One form recommended that the employee be rehired; the other recommended that the employee not be hired. Upon reviewing the administrative database for these individuals, we found that the recommendations had not been entered. We also found that Census supervisors and managers were informally gathering lists of employees that were being recommended for rehire. According to one supervisor, this was being done at the request of the regional center. Rather than identifying employees recommended for rehire on an informal basis, Census needs to formalize the process so that, as much as possible, trained and experienced personnel are rehired. Taking this action will reduce unnecessary recruiting and training efforts. Another important reason for having accurate and complete information on employee terminations is to be able to adequately handle, and where appropriate, refute, unemployment claims. A 1994 OIG inspection found that inadequate or incomplete documentation was a common problem in 17   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  the1990 Decennial Census, after which the bureau received more than 100,000 requests for wage and separation information, and the government paid $64 million in decennial-related unemployment compensation. The report concluded that millions of dollars in savings would result from having better management control in this area. We believe the same holds true for the 2000 decennial. Recommendations We recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Census ensure that: 1. Formal evaluations are prepared for all employees, and that rehire recommendations are documented to assist in rehiring decisions during Census 2000. 2. Evaluations of all employees whose performance is not acceptable is documented in the administrative management system. Agency Response 1. Ensure that formal evaluations are prepared for all employees, and that rehire recommendations are documented to assist in rehiring decisions during C2K. The Bureau does not concur: The Census Bureau requested and received approval from the Department of Commerce and the Office of Personnel Management to exclude census field workers from the General Work Force Performance Appraisal System requirements as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 430. The reason for this request was to alleviate temporary supervisors from the responsibility of evaluating employee performance that otherwise meets performance standards for these positions. Both administrative and field operations manuals provide specific guidance to Census supervisors on dealing with problem performers and conduct problems. Supervisors are required to complete forms D-283 and D282, Documentation of Performance and Conduct Problems, that are attached to the D-150, Personnel Action Request, when submitted to the administrative staff in the LCO. The PAMS/ADAMS Operating Manual provides guidance to personnel clerks for processing Discharge separation actions with the appropriate personnel action code. The Census Bureau has recently modified the PAMS/ADAMS to exclude previous employees who were terminated for cause from the D-425, Selection Record. Only former employees who were separated in good standing and/or resigned their position will be listed as experienced employees (as long as the former employee was separated within the last 6 months) separately on the selection certificates. This will allow census-selecting officials to reemploy desirable, experienced employees before employing new applicants. Former employees who did not work for the Census Bureau within the preceding 6 months, and were not previously discharged for cause, will be treated as new applicants and subject to employment suitability reviews. 18   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  2. Ensure that evaluations of all employees whose performance is not acceptable is documented in the administrative management systems. Problem resolved: See previous response regarding documentation procedures for poor performing employees. OIG Comments We are not recommending that Census implement any additional systems for performance evaluations of temporary workers. We are recommending that Census utilize an existing data field in Census form D-291 to document evaluation comments for all employees. We believe that the benefits, namely identification of good and poor performing workers and information critical to unemployment compensation determinations, are significantly greater than the cost of entering the data in the ADAMS system. We therefore reaffirm our recommendations regarding employee evaluations.  19   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General V. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NEED TO BE DOCUMENTED AND ORGANIZED  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  Many administrative decisions, instructions, and procedures related to the dress rehearsal were communicated orally and were not documented as required by sound management practices. An example is the undocumented decision to use VISA checks for salary advances as a response to late payroll checks. Most local office documentation consisted of manuals, amendments, memorandums, and E-mail, all of which were kept in files by the office manager. We found, however, that many oral instructions and directives were not adequately documented, and were not available to all managers and employees in an organized and documented format. Census guidelines encourage consistent operational processes among all local offices, as evidenced by Memorandum No. 98-42, which identifies Census offices and individuals responsible for different issues. For example, guidance regarding oversight and liaison is to be provided by the Budget, Management, Oversight Liaison Staff, which will designate its memos as Decennial Oversight and Liaison Memorandums No. 98-01, 02, etc.. To determine whether all administrative policies and procedures were available, complete, and updated at both the Seattle regional center and the Sacramento office, we requested and reviewed all policy and procedure documentation. We found at the regional center that policies and procedures were not well organized or up-to-date. The center administrative staff could locate memoranda only in response to our specific requests, could not ensure that copies of all memoranda were obtained, and were unsure as to how to order replacements. At the Sacramento office, all manuals, amendments, memoranda, and E-mails were kept permanently in a central location, in designated notebooks at the manager's desk. Copies were also distributed to appropriate supervisory personnel. We inventoried the available administrative related policies and procedures and verified the presence of applicable documents at the local office. We found that documentation was generally complete at the local office except for orally transmitted instructions and directives. Recommendation We recommend that the Acting Director of the Bureau of the Census ensure that: 1. Regional center managers require that all administrative and program instructions that have been provided orally also be communicated as written documents.  20   U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General Agency Response  Audit Report No. STL-11052-8-0001 September 1998  1. Ensure that Regional Census Center managers require that all administrative and program instructions that have been provided orally also be communicated as written documents. The Census Bureau concurs with the intent of this recommendation: The responsibility for ensuring written administrative and program guidance for decennial activities lies with Census Bureau headquarters, not the RCCs. The Census Bureau recently consolidated a list of all memorandum series that are issued by field headquarters for use by the RCCs. Each memorandum series was identified by a brief description and the names of appropriate contacts to call to obtain additional copies. The Field Division, in conjunction with the RCCs, developed generic cc:MAIL accounts to ensure the distribution of all memoranda to a centralized location. RCC staff is responsible for disseminating copies of these memoranda (which includes administrative and program instructions) to the LCOs, as appropriate. This provides for consistency in implementing administrative and operational procedures and should ensure the written documentation of Bureau-wide policies and procedures. OIG Comments We concur with Census' proposed course of action. We commend the Bureau for initiating actions to adequately address our recommendation.  21"
GX004-88-13690630	"Postal Service Reemployment         Short Summary of Update:     The buyout reemployment restriction applies to the U. S. Postal Service, and OPM cannot waive repayment of the buyout.        Update:      Buyout reemployment restrictions apply to the U.S. Postal Service, and OPM cannot waive repayment of the buyout for Federal employees who take the incentive and then want to take a job with the Postal Service.  Under Section 3(d)(1) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act, ""an employee who has received a voluntary separation incentive payment under this section and accepts employment with the Government of the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which the payment is based shall be required to repay the entire amount of the incentive payment to the agency that paid the incentive payment.""    The U.S. Postal Service is an independent establishment of the Executive Branch of the Government of the United States. Further, the U.S. Postal Service is operated as a basic and fundamental service provided to the people by the Government of the United States, and its officers and employees are a part of the civil service (39 U.S.C.)  Employment with the U.S. Postal Service falls within the broad phrasing, ""Government of the United States.""  Thus, buyout reemployment restrictions apply to the U.S. Postal Service.    In addition, since the term ""employment"" in Section 3(d)(1) of the Act, includes employment under a personal services contract with the United States, the buyout restriction concerning personal services contracts also applies to the U.S. Postal Service.    Pursuant to the Act, if an individual who has taken the buyout is reemployed with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105 of title 5, United States Code), the Director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may, at the request of the head of the agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position.  An Executive agency means an Executive Department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment . The Postal Service is not an Executive Department or a Government corporation. While the Postal Service is an independent establishment of the Executive Branch under title 39, it is not an ""independent establishment"" under title 5, United States Code.  Thus, since the U.S. Postal Service is not an Executive agency under title 5, OPM does not have the authority to waive the repayment of the buyout.        [ Top ] [ Back ]"

GX233-52-7582630	New York State employees possess a tremendous range of skills, competencies, and experiences. Continuous learning is essential for both employee and employer given ongoing and rapid changes in the work world. You are encouraged to pursue learning for your personal growth and career advancement.    Participation in some training and education programs is required as part of your job, while others are available to you on a voluntary basis. Training activities related directly to performing your job are normally conducted during working hours. When a voluntary program takes place during your work day, you will need your supervisor's approval to attend. You may also choose to participate in voluntary programs that take place after normal working hours.          Announcements for training programs and course listings, as well as educational literature from the public employee unions, are available at your agency training or personnel office. They are also posted on bulletin boards and on-line. It is up to you to make inquiries and take advantage of these opportunities. Ask your supervisor or personnel officer about additional opportunities that might be available to you to further your formal education.         Many State agencies have their own training units that provide specific on-the-job training. Your supervisor will tell you what training programs you are required to attend. These may be offered within your agency or you may be sent to classes near your work site. State agencies, and units within agencies, may also provide voluntary workshops, seminars, or other forms of training that may be attended by employees. In-service training is designed to:      develop knowledge and skills when a new program or project is started;   introduce work processes or technologies when implementing a new communication or reporting procedure;    instruct on the operation of a new piece of equipment or computer program; or   enhance existing employee competencies.          Your agency's orientation program is usually a first step in the overall on-the-job training process. In addition to agency-sponsored training activities, your daily interaction with your supervisor and fellow employees provides on-the-job training. An integral part of successful orientation is the learning that takes place through observation, communication, and discussion between and among employees and their supervisors concerning the specific job tasks of individuals and work units.    I came to work for NYS for job security and the good benefits. I started as a typist and now, through the tuition reimbursement program, I already have an Associates degree and I am working towards a Bachelors degree.  Going to school helped me get promoted , along with experience.    Advice to newly hired employees:   There is a lot of opportunity for promotion in NYS if you are willing to move around to different positions. It is a great place to work.    Cindy Michelin  Administrative Aide   State Police   21 years with NYS      Your supervisor will encourage you to discuss your job tasks, and any problems you may be having with them, on an informal basis. More formal review and documentation of job tasks and accomplishments will occur annually through the performance evaluation process, which may identify additional training areas to help you progress in your career. Be sure to watch for training announcements on bulletin boards, web sites, and in inter-office communications. Speak to your supervisor or training office about what training programs would be best for you.        New York State and the public employee unions recognize that employee training and development benefits both employees and the organizations for which they work. Many statewide training programs are funded through the negotiated agreements with each of the unions. These programs are designed to:     develop competent employees, supervisors, managers, and leaders;   support individual growth and achievement;   address organizational needs;   strengthen job skills; and   assist employees in adapting to new technologies.      In partnership with CSEA and PEF, the Governor's Office of Employee Relations offers a wide range of training programs and educational services. Topics include supervisory and leadership development, conflict resolution, diversity awareness, organizational skill development, career enhancement, quality processes, customer service, state policies, and job skill enhancement. Training is received through attendance at workshops and customized classes offered across the State, as well as through distance learning opportunities using the latest technologies.     New programs are continuously developed in response to the changing needs of New York State agencies and their workers. GOER staff and staff from the labor management programs are available to work with individual employees and agency executives to develop customized approaches for improving agency and employee performance. For specific information about these programs or answers to questions about training programs in general, please call 518-474-6772, visit our web site at  www.goer.state.ny.us/Train , or write to:     Governor's Office of Employee Relations  Work Force Training and Development Unit   2 Empire State Plaza, Suite 1201  Albany, NY 12223-1250     Information about specific programs can also be obtained from your agency personnel, training, and/or affirmative action offices; local union representative or your union's education and training office, or one of the following organizations:    Clerical and Secretarial Employee Advancement Program (CSEAP)  NYS Department of Civil Service  W.A. Harriman State Office Building Campus  Albany, NY 12239  518-457-0003     NYS/CSEA Labor Management Committees  55 Elk Street  Albany, NY 12210   518-473-3416          Through negotiated agreements with the employee unions, New York State offers you a variety of tuition voucher and reimbursement opportunities. Programs are designed to provide financial assistance for employees to improve job skills, performance, and career opportunities by taking credit-bearing or non-credit-bearing courses at participating New York State educational institutions.    CSEA-represented employees may take advantage of the Labor Education Action Program (LEAP), which provides tuition vouchers for enrollment in college, university and BOCES classes. Educational advice is available via the LEAPline at 1-800-253-4332. Similar programs for PEF-represented employees are the Public Service Training Program (PSTP) Voucher and Voucher Alternative programs, which may be used for continued professional education at statewide colleges and universities. Employees who are designated Management/Confidential (M/C) may apply for tuition reimbursement through the Governor's Office of Employee Relations. State agencies may provide additional tuition assistance to their employees for specific job-related course work. Additional information on any of the tuition assistance programs, and appropriate application forms, are available at your agency/facility training or personnel office, union education and training offices, or on the GOER web site at  www.goer.state.ny.us/Train .         Release Time  - Some programs involve release time from the job with pay; some may require that you attend on your own time or that you charge your leave accruals. In any case, it is usually up to the employee's agency to determine if an individual can be excused from the workplace to attend training.     Leaves of Absence for Study  - Employees may be eligible for unpaid leaves of absence to pursue educational studies. If you are a veteran, you may have special rights regarding a leave of absence without pay for educational purposes. Contact your personnel office or the Department of Civil Service for additional information.

This thoughtprovoking document offers a timely and comprehensive examination of the way the Federal Government currently determines employee pay. It is merely intended to open the conversation on the possibilities for a modernized Federal pay system for the 21st century. We find ourselves in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Americans are expressing an interest in public service unseen in recent decades. This renewed desire to serve occurs at the very time that the Federal Government is looking to bring new talent, new skills, and new energy into its workforce. To attract the best and the brightest in this next generation into public service, we need a pay system that reflects the realities of the modern workforce where performance and results are emphasized and rewarded. What will such a system look like? My hope in sharing this OPM White Paper is that it will help to bring that vision into focus. It contains insights on the Federal Government's compensation system, its origins, how it upholds the merit system principles, and its operation in current labor markets and as an important component of the Government's performance culture. This paper is the result of extensive research and stakeholder discussions through OPM's Strategic Compensation Initiative. I was delighted to learn that this thoughtful dialogue was already well underway when I arrived at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Now we move to the next phase. I invite you to become an active participant in the broader discussion. The possibilities are truly exciting, and our workforce deserves nothing less than our best efforts at modernizing our pay system.

As recent events have shown all too clearly, Government performance is critically important. To meet the challenges of the present  and to anticipate and overcome the challenges of the future  Government must design and use merit-based policies and systems that are more modern, strategic, and results-focused. If the Government is to recruit, manage, and retain the human capital needed to accomplish and sustain this transformation, its white-collar pay system would need to: Achieve the principle of providing equal pay for work of equal value; Provide agencies the means to offer competitive salary levels on a timely, rational basis; Recognize competencies and results, at both the individual and organizational level; and Orient employee efforts and pay expenditures toward mission accomplishment. This White Paper examines the extent to which the current Federal white-collar pay system  the General Schedule covering 1.2 million employees  achieves these objectives. OPM believes the system would have to be judged as failing this examination, for several reasons:  The Government asks its agency leaders to face new and unprecedented management challenges using an antiquated pay system. Work level descriptions in law that date back more than 50 years are not meaningful for today's knowledge-driven organizations.  The current pay system does not reflect market pay levels. Instead, pay increases and locality adjustments result from a cumbersome and costly measurement system that may be trying to answer the wrong questions.  It has minimal ability to encourage and reward achievement and results. Over 75 percent of the increase in Federal pay bears no relationship to individual achievement or competence.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   vi  Its structure suits the workforce of 1950, not today's knowledge workers. In 1950, over 75 percent of Federal workers  mostly clerical  were in grade GS-7 or below; today that percentage has dropped to less than 30 percent.  Its prescribed procedures and practices effectively preclude agencies from tailoring pay programs to their specific missions and labor markets. It is unlikely that a common and highly structured system is appropriate for positions as diverse as those found in agencies such as the National Weather Service, the Social Security Administration, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and the Centers for Disease Control.  It is disintegrating. Through special authorities, a number of agencies already have begun to move toward more modern systems, and our ability to promote common policies across the Government where appropriate is diminishing. OPM does not fault the framers of the General Schedule for designing pay and job evaluation systems that reflected their world of work. But neither can a compensation system that was designed in the middle of the 20th century be expected to function well in the 21st century where organizations use a broader view of strategic rewards. The result of OPM's examination is clear: seizing systemic, governmentwide opportunities for changing the white-collar pay system is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. In its current condition, the system is an impediment to the Government's critical efforts to enhance security and replace technical and scientific expertise in the face of looming retirements. This White Paper is pre-decisional: although it documents many problems in our current pay and job evaluations systems, it does not describe the solutions to those problems. Its objectives are to help stakeholders learn from the Government's history and experience and to inform the debate over how the Government can preserve core values of public service  such as equity, procedural justice, openness, and accountability  while modernizing its compensation practices. OPM will distribute the paper widely to stimulate dialogue and discussion. The aim is to surface areas of agreement and disagreement and concern and consensus so that the Federal community may be fully informed as we pursue future directions for improving pay as a strategic tool for managing human capital.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   1  Introduction This White Paper takes an in-depth look at the way the Federal Government pays its white-collar employees. Any comprehensive improvements to our pay system that may be needed would be momentous. Consequently, they should be considered only after carefully examining the means and implications of ensuring that the white-collar pay system is an effective tool for the strategic management of human capital. To that end, any changes in the pay system must support the various other initiatives that are underway to improve Federal recruitment, hiring, and retention and to focus on meaningful performance distinctions as the key drivers for human resources and reward decisions. Those reform efforts have surfaced recurring themes concerning the constraints and contradictions the pay system imposes. That system, in turn, must operate under significant fiscal constraints where costs must be forecast, managed, and contained. Unless the Federal Government develops a system that is affordable during difficult budget times, there is no hope for success. Such realities and relationships characterize our complex employment environment. In the White Paper presented here, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) focuses only on the General Schedule (GS) pay and job evaluation systems that cover the Federal Government's white-collar work. A number of pay-related issues that affect other systems and pay structures have also received attention and deserve consideration in another forum. OPM acknowledges that such other systems, including the Federal Wage System that covers blue-collar work, have a relationship to GS pay. For example, the pay compression that currently affects members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) could have a significant, if indirect, effect on proposals that might be developed to address the pay of GS employees. However, SES compensation design and administration involve additional factors  such as their relationship to the Executive Schedule rates of pay for the most senior positions in Government  that this White Paper is not intended to address. This White Paper lays bare the problems with the Federal Government's current white-collar pay and job evaluation1 systems that years of experience, research, and discussion have exposed. Significant portions of that research and discussion  1  The term ""job evaluation"" refers to the process for establishing the relative value of a position in a hierarchy of jobs, in the Federal Government, by classifying positions. The term does not mean performance evaluation or appraisal.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   2  have occurred most recently as OPM staff launched an effort known as the Strategic Compensation Initiative. Framed around a combination of research and outreach, the initiative included an extensive examination of the current Federal white-collar pay and classification systems. OPM sought insights from the private sector, the non-Federal public sector, and those portions of the Federal sector that have already moved beyond the system established under title 5 of the United States Code. The research included staying current on developments and trends in compensation, including practices that developed as employers waged the war for information technology talent during the ""dot.com"" bubble. However, to preclude misleading conclusions based on generalizing from short-lived ""schemes du jour"" that might lack strategic staying power, the research OPM undertook concentrated on employers whose size and functions made them comparable to Federal agencies. For example, a specific alignment of general governmental functions with private sector counterparts led to surveys of utilities, banking, accounting, and telecommunications firms, but not retail sales or entertainment enterprises. Research on non-Federal public sector entities surfaced a variety of systems and approaches  principally in State governments  where settings ranged from States where comprehensive collective bargaining agreements are negotiated at the State level to States that have no bargaining units at all. States that recently reformed their pay systems to be more performance and results driven were of particular interest. Finally, OPM made a thorough review of Federal settings where alternative pay and job evaluation systems had been established, including demonstration projects and agencies that Congress granted independent compensation and classification authority. These situations offered particularly useful evidence about the kinds of alternatives that have been implemented successfully with Federal workforces and cultures. In addition to conducting and sponsoring specialized research, OPM invited stakeholders from agencies, Federal employee unions, associations of managerial and professional employees, and the public administration community to join in examining existing systems and mechanisms, as well as alternatives, and considering possibilities that could improve their strategic value for the 21st century.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   3  The White Paper is structured around some broad themes and supplemented with more in-depth analyses  a series of ""Closer Looks"" that explore or illustrate particular issues. By this means, beyond merely cataloguing faults, the White Paper also surfaces opportunities and the nature of the solutions they represent. However, it lays out no specific proposals for changing the General Schedule system. The purpose here is to create a shared understanding across the public service community can be applied to discussing and shaping approaches that may be appropriate to ensure that agencies can use the Federal Government's white-collar pay system effectively to improve the strategic management of their human capital.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   4  A System Whose Time Has Come  and Gone The fundamental nature of the Federal compensation system was established at the end of the 1940s, a time when over 70 percent of Federal white-collar jobs consisted of clerical work. Government work today is highly skilled and specialized ""knowledge work."" Yet in the age of the computer, the Federal Government still uses  with few modifications  pay and job evaluation systems that were designed for the age of the file clerk. The divergence between the Federal pay system and the broader world of work where the war for talent must be fought has led observers to call for reform of the Federal system. To support achievement of the Government's strategic goals, a new, more flexible system may be called for, one that better supports the strategic management of human capital and allows agencies to tailor their pay practices to recruit, manage, and retain the talent to accomplish their mission.  The formidable challenges of World War II were overcome by breaking them into their component problems and solving those problems through centralized planning and the application of uniform methods. At the end of the 1940s, the Federal Government's civilian workforce was ripe for application of this scientific management approach, as embodied in the Classification Act of 1949. Over 70 percent of Federal white-collar jobs consisted of clerical work  work such as posting census figures in ledgers or retrieving taxpayer records from vast file rooms. It made sense to manage this work by breaking it into clearly describable positions. It made sense to sort these positions based on clear-cut, enduring differences in the difficulty, responsibility, and skill requirements of the work employees carried out. It made sense to use such differences as the foundation for all aspects of human resources management, such as setting pay, thus making position the principal driver of most Federal personnel administration systems. That focus on position rather than performance made sense for this army of clerks in the late 1940s. Indeed, it made little sense for pay to reflect variations in employee performance  most of the work was so cut and dried that employees had scant opportunity to distinguish themselves from their peers. As for using comparisons with pay outside the Government, that was not even on the map yet. Specific pay rates and pay raises for Federal employees were established by Congress through legislation, not through any sort of administrative, marketbased procedure.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   5  The Classification Act of 1949 used work level descriptions that date to 1912 to extend a centralized job evaluation system to all white-collar positions, thereby establishing internal equity  a fairness and consistency criterion aimed at ensuring that each job is compensated according to its relative place in a single hierarchy of positions  as the centerpiece of Federal compensation. The Act also merged several separate ""schedules"" of pay rates into one ""General Schedule."" Finally  and fatefully  it defined the Federal Government's pay and job evaluation structure in statute, where it has remained essentially unchanged for over 50 years. During this 50-year period, much has changed, including: The nature of work. When the General Schedule was created, the Federal Government was largely a ""Government of clerks."" But most Government work no longer revolves around the execution of established, stable processes or the application of physical effort. Instead, as illustrated in the chart below, Federal white-collar work has become highly skilled and increasingly specialized ""knowledge work"" that is properly classified at higher grade levels.  The Changing General Schedule Workforce 25 % 20 % 15 % 10 % 5% 0% GS - 1 GS - 2 GS - 3 GS - 4 GS - 5 GS - 6 GS - 7 G S -8 GS - 9 GS - 1 0 G S -1 1 GS - 1 2 G S -1 3 G S -1 4 G S -1 5  19 5 0  20 00  Some of the work-related features of the General Schedule are not just dated, they are counterintuitive. If two employees perform similar jobs but one employee has a much greater workload, can that employee's salary be higher? Not under the General Schedule  if the level of difficulty of two jobs is the same, they are in same salary range. If one employee performs a wider variety of tasks than other employees, can that result in higher pay? Not if the tasks are at the same level. If the busier employees complain that this is inequitable, APRIL 2002 U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   6  what can the agency do? Take work away from the busier employees. Years ago, spreading clerical tasks across similar, stable positions made sense; in today's multi-tasking workplace, the system appears illogical. The role of compensation in organizations. In most organizations, particularly those in the private sector, compensation management has become considerably more than simply calculating and paying the bill for employee efforts. The concept of compensation and rewards has broadened. Organizations have come to view their compensation and reward systems as much more than schemes managed out of the comptroller's office and designed to contain salary and related benefits costs.1 Today, organizations manage their rewards systems out of their human resources offices.2 They design them to use pay, awards, benefits, learning and development, challenging and satisfying work, work-life balance, and a supportive work environment strategically to attract, manage, develop, and retain high-quality, diverse workforces that meet their specific human capital needs. This paper's first Closer Look: A Framework for Strategic Rewards (pages 4042) provides more detail about this broader view of what employees find rewarding. The purpose and tactics of compensation have also broadened. Organizations no longer view their annual compensation budgets simplistically as the bill for ""another year's worth of labor inputs."" Instead, they use flexible, targeted compensation tools to acquire and retain critical talent. Compensation's role in recruiting gets considerable attention from both employers and potential employees. Organizations no longer use compensation principally to encourage and reward unquestioning loyalty from undifferentiated ""human resources""; instead, they use compensation to communicate and reward desired values, behaviors, and outcomes. Federal agencies are similarly poised to use compensation as a strategic tool, rather than a merely administrative tool. This shift is already visible in a wide variety of demonstration projects and alternative personnel systems that align agency pay practices and bonus and award programs with agency strategic goals.  1  2  For every dollar increase in basic pay, or ""benefits-bearing compensation,"" agencies routinely budget an additional 20 to 30 cents as an estimate of related benefits cost obligations that dollar will generate. In a related development within the Federal Government, President Bush's FY 2003 Budget for the first time displays agencies' future cost accruals for employee benefits at the agency level, thereby reinforcing this Administration's policy that agencies must be strategic in their use of all human resources-related funding. The President's proposed Managerial Flexibility Act includes statutory changes that would effect this accounting change permanently.

OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   7  Employee expectations. The employees of the 1940s and 1950s shared the experiences of economic depression and war. They sought stability and security. The Federal compensation system, with its career ladders (where employees start their careers in positions at low grades with the prospect of advancement over time to higher-grade positions), time-based pay increases, and benefits keyed to length of service, reflects a conception of employment predicated on a 30-year career with the same employer. That model is designed to reward loyalty by providing stable and secure employment, reflecting and meeting those needs. But increasingly employees neither expect nor seek that form of security from their employer. Instead, they expect immediate rewards and recognition for their individual accomplishments and consider continued employability the key to security. Stakeholder expectations. Employees and their representatives, as well as agencies and other stakeholders, have expectations about how human resources management systems are developed and implemented today. With a consistent migration away from tightly legislated systems to administrative authorities that lend themselves to decentralization and delegation, stakeholders expect to influence how those administrative authorities will be designed and used. Agencies want the latitude to adapt system features to support their strategic needs. At the same time, elected employee representatives expect to have a voice in systems affecting their members. Engaging unions in fundamental workplace change is a sound human capital practice and recognizes that labor and management have a shared stake in building a more effective Government that delivers results to the American people. Although the Federal white-collar pay system has been refined in response to these changes, these refinements have not changed its fundamental character, which remains focused on internal equity (to reflect relative place in a hierarchy of positions) and leaves little meaningful room for external equity (to accommodate changes in labor market rates for different occupations) or individual equity (to reward excellent performance). Consequently, the outdated beliefs and expectations underlying our pay and classification systems have diverged from those of the broader world of work where the war for talent must be fought today. This divergence has led observers and architects of Government human resources management systems to contemplate possible modernization of the  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   8  Federal compensation system.3 During the 1980s and early 1990s, these observers advocated reform of various aspects of the Federal compensation system, such as the classification system4 and the pay-setting process,5 as well as benefits.6 The calls for reform continue, but their character has changed. Observers continue to recommend measures such as simplifying the classification system, but an increasing number believe that incremental changes will not suffice. For example, when the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) examined Federal information technology (IT) recruitment and retention issues in 2001, it recommended that the Federal Government reexamine the core values of its compensation system, and noted: By focusing on internal equity, the federal government's human resources management system is severely constrained in competing for IT talent and effectively managing the IT talent that it already has. . . . A new federal IT compensation system should move to a better balance between and among internal equity, external equity, and contribution equity.7  Other observers have reached similar conclusions,8 and some now contend that the current system is unsalvageable: Title 5 provides a rigid, rule-based system that is unlikely to provide the needed flexibility to compete for talent in the twenty-first century.9 [The Administration] is quite right to keep pushing for greater flexibility. If that means abolishing the current system and its 450 job classifications, all the better. This is one case where nothing is truly better than something.10  These calls for pay and classification reform have gone largely unheeded. Although Congress has, in selected instances, acknowledged the inadequacies of  3  4  5 6 7  8  9  10  The possibility of a need for systemic change was acknowledged and anticipated in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which authorized the establishment of ""demonstration projects"" by the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. 4703 to test progressive human resources practices for possible governmentwide adoption.

The phrase ""haves and have nots"" is often used to contrast conditions. When it comes to compensation in the Federal Government, a more apt phrase might be ""cans and cannots."" A few agencies ""can"" design, modify, and manage their own compensation systems. But most agencies ""cannot"" and must follow the General Schedule. More than 10 percent of white-collar employees are in such ""can"" organizations that have been granted the opportunity to manage compensation in ways that meet their strategic goals, from the General Accounting Office in the 1970s to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2001. All other agencies  operating in the same economic environment as the ""cans"" and faced with the same expectations to achieve important goals  are forced to press on as ""cannots."" The Federal white-collar pay system continues to be defined by the General Schedule  the pay and classification structure established by the Classification Act of 1949  and thus remains essentially unchanged. Readers less familiar with the workings of the General Schedule will find a description of its current design and operation in the second Closer Look: A Primer on the General Schedule (pages 4344). The General Schedule and its supporting practices have served us well. But it is not realistic to expect it to remain functional forever. The third Closer Look: Why Not Preserve the General Schedule? (pages 4547) considers the pros and cons of sustaining it further. The fact that a system like the General Schedule may be at the end of its useful life is nothing new in modern post-industrial organizations, as the Federal Government must become. Here is one compensation consultant's description of the futility of expecting any private sector compensation system to endure indefinitely: If an organization is within a stable economy, in a stable industry, and operating in a status-quo operation, a pay program can be designed and forgotten. It [will not] need to change. But, for most organizations, the macroeconomy is constantly changing, as is the industry and the company. . . . Unfortunately, many organizations put a pay design in place and, other than periodic market-  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   10 based pay level adjustments, forget about it. Unfortunately, this does not work. The business world is dynamic.11  This point is equally applicable to the Federal Government. In the age of the computer, the Federal Government is still using  with relatively minor modifications  a compensation system that was custom-built for the processobsessed age of the file clerk. A structure that regarded performance differences as negligible in the context of highly standardized clerical routines has lasted to a time when the nature of knowledge work makes performance differences a crucial element in the value of many jobs. A structure made to maximize internal equity has lasted to a time when the Government may need to make more useful comparisons to non-Federal rates of pay. The result is that many observers believe our pay system no longer works and is not a useful tool for the strategic management of human capital. Kay Frances Dolan, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources at the Department of the Treasury, offered this perspective: We have critical occupations at Treasury that range from economists, to criminal investigators, to computer specialists and accountants. A pay system needs to be flexible and responsive so we can compete with other employers in the marketplace, and also take into account an individual's competencies and performance. Our current system wasn't built with these goals in mind.  Even more important, however, is whether the pay system is congruent with the values and objectives that 21st century public sector leaders have embraced. Our pay system has significant features that are antithetical to the performance-based and results-rewarding Government that the framers of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 on both sides of the aisle had in mind.  If What We've Got Is Wrong, What Would Be Right? To support achievement of the Government's strategic goals, a more modern pay system is needed. A modernized system could allow agencies considerable flexibility so that each agency might develop specific pay programs and practices to recruit, manage, and retain the results-oriented competencies necessary to accomplish its mission. Specific elements of effective strategic compensation programs  salary levels that target specific labor markets, means of adjusting individual pay within a pay range, use of performance-based pay  tend to vary  11  Paul Gilles, ""Building a Foundation for Effective Pay Programs,"" Workspan, vol. 44, No. 9, WorldatWork, Scottsdale, AZ, September 2001, p. 31.

Allowing agencies to tailor their practices to their strategic human capital management needs would permit them to reorient their rewards systems and reach performance goals and objectives more effectively and efficiently. Changes made to the Government's compensation system would impact the working lives of more than a million Federal employees. While in OPM's opinion, bargaining pay should not be part of a new system, it is recognized that Congress would establish whether and to what extent that system will be subject to collective bargaining. In advance of any potential legislative action, it is also recognized that the only effective way to bring about change on this scale is to involve all stakeholders, including employee unions, in the redesign process. The challenge will be to formulate and design a modern, more strategic approach to Federal pay that effectively serves the shared interests of Federal employees and their representatives, Federal agencies and their missions, and the American people in the 21st century.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   12  The System Is Market Insensitive One of the precepts embodied in the Federal Government's merit system principles is market sensitivity. Even with the reforms in the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), however, the Federal concept of comparability is two dimensional, reflecting only grade (level of work) and locality. This conception bears little resemblance to established compensation practice. Labor market shortages and excesses are described and analyzed in terms of occupations, skills, specialties, and locations, not grade level. Private-sector employers tend to respond to labor markets in similar terms. FEPCA's Achilles heel is its inability to reflect pay differences across occupations at the same level of work; the auxiliary mechanisms under the General Schedule are simply inadequate to recognize occupational differences. In addition, FEPCA's survey methodology loses relevance owing to its pretense of precision and its lengthy deliberations. Alternative means of following the merit system principle and giving ""appropriate consideration to both national and local rates"" need to be investigated.  The Federal Government's merit system principles include several precepts for governing the pay of Federal employees, including: Equal pay should be provided for work of equal value, with appropriate consideration of both national and local rates paid by employers in the private sector.1  Commonly, that principle is cited only in terms of its first element, and even that is often misquoted as ""equal pay for equal work."" However, as the fuller text indicates, the conception of merit includes considering the pay offered by employers outside the Federal Government, and thus comprises the principle of external equity. One of the reasons the Federal compensation system falls short of this ideal is that it may fail to provide ""appropriate consideration"" of those external rates. As Gail T. Lovelace, Chief People Officer at the General Services Administration put it: ""Under the current system we are unable to compete in the labor market for candidates for our most important occupations."" This failure in considering external rates, however, is not simply reflected in an overall ""gap"" between Federal and non-Federal pay. Many observers argue that at least some gaps exist for some occupational categories and should be addressed 1  5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(3) OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   13  appropriately. Under the current methodology for calculating pay gaps, the gaps vary significantly by occupational group. For example, some occupational groups in some locations show little or no pay gap, while the gap is as much as 40 percent for other occupations in other locations. The current system does not address such differences effectively. This is because the system recognizes imperfectly  if at all  that: Labor market rates differ across occupations, as well as across pay grades; Labor market rates differ within an occupation; Labor market rates differ across individuals; Labor markets can change rapidly; and Organizations do not respond uniformly to labor market changes, because they are not affected uniformly by those changes. In the late 1980s, legislation was proposed to address these shortcomings. A key element of the proposal would have aligned the Federal pay structure more closely with labor markets. The initial proposal would have replaced the General Schedule with a national pay structure covering professional and administrative positions and a set of local pay structures covering clerical and support positions.2 This proposal encountered substantial opposition reflecting concerns that the two pay structures would diverge and that one group of employees might benefit at the expense of the other. Eventually, a compromise was reached in which the General Schedule would remain intact, but would be supplemented by localitybased payments, which could be extended to other employees. This compromise, enacted in the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), has proved problematic. Although FEPCA was acceptable enough to be enacted into law, it was not plausible enough to be fully implemented: In the 10 years since the FEPCA was enacted, annual pay increases have not followed official recommendations to close the ""pay gap."" The main reason: Neither Congress nor the Administration has found the official methodology credible or compelling.3  2  3  Technically, the division would have followed career patterns, with the national structure covering two-grade interval work and the local structures covering one-grade interval work.

APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   14  Three factors contribute to this ""credibility gap."" The first is rooted in FEPCA's definition of comparability, reflected in its statutory principle that ""Federal pay rates be comparable with non-Federal pay rates for the same levels of work within the same local pay area.""4 In other words, FEPCA's conception of labor markets is two-dimensional, with the dimensions being grade (i.e., level of work) and locality. This conception bears little resemblance to the reality of labor markets. For example, labor market shortages and excesses are described and analyzed in terms of occupations, skills, specialties, and locations, not grade level. When the Department of Commerce examined employment trends in the information technology (IT) workforce, it reported significant job growth and prospective shortages in specific occupations, such as database administrator, systems analyst, and computer engineer;5 it did not report a shortage of undifferentiated GS-12s and GS-13s. The fourth Closer Look: Labor Markets Are Not Supermarkets (pages 4852) discusses this issue for Federal compensation in more detail and illustrates what may be FEPCA's Achilles heel  its inability to reflect systematic pay differences among occupations at the same level of work. Private sector employers tend to respond to labor markets in terms of occupations or specialized skill sets. For example, companies may raise salaries and starting offers for IT professionals with hard-to-find skills, but such actions do not automatically result in pay increases for their employees in other occupations. The Federal Government lacks this nimbleness, because its auxiliary mechanisms available under the General Schedule to recognize occupational differences are inadequate, as discussed in the fifth Closer Look: The Problem With Special Salary Rates (pages 5354). The second factor underlying FEPCA's credibility gap is that its methodology presumes an unrealistic level of precision and requires lengthy deliberation, both at the expense of relevance and strategic utility. Under FEPCA, general pay increases are based on changes in the Employment Cost Index (ECI). Locality payments, which are calculated to one one-hundredth of one percent, are based on surveys of salaries in each locality pay area.6 Because these surveys are extensive and statistically rigorous, significant time lags occur between data 4 5 6  5 U.S.C. 5301(3). U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of Technology Policy, ""Update: The Digital Workforce,"" August 2000. A survey is also used to calculate locality payments for the ""rest of U.S."" locality pay area, generally referred to as RUS. RUS consists of all areas of the continental United States that are not part of another locality pay area. OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   15  gathering and pay-setting and implementation. After adding the time that the Federal budget planning and appropriation processes must necessarily entail, the result is a tenuous relationship between pay adjustments and current market conditions. The third factor diminishing FEPCA's credibility is that its statutory language requires the calculation of a single average pay gap in each locality pay area. Even though sophisticated methods of weighting are used to take into account the actual presence and distribution of Federal work, the result nonetheless disguises and ignores substantial differences in the degree to which Federal and non-Federal salaries for particular occupations or grades differ. By its very nature an average is describing a set of values half of which are higher and half are lower than the summary statistic. In this instance, the average the law requires us to use in describing a ""pay gap"" is no Golden Mean, but more of a Great Muddle that describes nothing very meaningfully and masks the relevant differences across occupations and levels of work in each locality pay area, to the strategic detriment of the entire approach. This is not to say that FEPCA should be rated a failure. It would be more accurate to say that FEPCA has been both a partial success and an unavoidable failure. Under FEPCA, the Federal Government has: Successfully implemented and administered a locality pay system; Gained a better understanding of labor markets; Developed experience in conducting and applying salary surveys; Introduced market-oriented tools such as recruitment bonuses and retention allowances; and Learned that defining and implementing comparability in simplified and overly broad terms would eventually and inevitably produce the effect of delivering actual comparability to relatively few while overpaying or underpaying others. For many years, employee groups and others considering further changes to the Federal pay system have taken the position that FEPCA should be fully implemented before making more changes.7 However, as the Federal budget once again faces deficits, the Administration has not requested and Congress may  7  See Strengthening the Link Between Pay and Performance.

APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   16  be unlikely to fund the $11 billion for locality adjustments and related benefits costs  which would subsequently be built into the budget base and increase outyear costs  that ""full implementation"" of FEPCA in 2003 would require. This reality is particularly compelling in light of that final ""lesson learned"" from FEPCA implementation  that ignoring occupational differences undermines the system's strategic utility. Rather, it may now be time to build on FEPCA's significant lessons and explore and develop alternative means and meanings for following the merit system principle to give ""appropriate consideration to both national and local rates."" The sixth Closer Look: Whither Comparability? (pages 5556) discusses this issue in more detail. This much remains clear: the market sensitivity that our merit system contemplates is essential for a robust 21st century pay system.  If What We've Got Is Wrong, What Would Be Right? Our white-collar pay system should be reexamined to identify and explore alternatives for addressing external or market equity and making more useful comparisons with non-Federal pay. External comparisons might better be made against segments of outside labor markets  not against the entire economy of non-Federal white-collar work  so that a nimble system can recognize and accommodate strategic occupational differences. The methodology for such comparisons may need to provide a better balance of cost, timeliness, and precision. And the system should perhaps recognize the limitations of any methodology used to give the merit system principle's ""appropriate consideration of both national and local rates paid by [other] employers"" and move beyond attempting to survey and measure rates precisely for specific positions in specific locations.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   17  The System Is Performance Insensitive In the current Federal white-collar pay system, performance does not matter very much. The way the Government delivers pay increases  and the relative value of those pay increases  reinforces the message that performance is secondary at best. In any given year, Federal employees receive more pay increases for remaining on the rolls than for meeting or exceeding performance expectations. The dominance of these performance-insensitive pay increases can make performanceoriented tools appear trivial. As recent events have shown all too clearly, Government performance is critically important, and system improvements may be needed so that agencies can recognize and value the competencies and contributions of their employees better. To be truly results-oriented, the Government would require a compensation system where performance truly makes a difference.  The Federal white-collar pay system sends and reinforces the message that performance does not matter. This message harms both mission accomplishment and recruiting effectiveness: [The] current system is weakening the It underwhelms at almost every task it young Americans are asked to picture picture themselves in dead-end jobs w public service undertakes. . themselves in here seniority, it was designed to protect. . . Sad to say, when public service careers, they not performance, rules.1  This was not the intent of the framers of the system. The closing words of the very same merit system principle that charges us to consider external equity make it quite clear that performance should matter: . . . and appropriate incentives and recognition should be provided for excellence in performance.2  But the current system's structures and incentives were designed for a time when ""performance"" was so highly routinized that many employees simply had little means or opportunity to distinguish themselves from their coworkers. Within the Federal Government, our understanding of ""performance"" has become much more sophisticated, particularly with the advent of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which shifted our focus 1 2  Paul C. Light, ""Battle of the Bureaus,"" The Washington Post, March 11, 1999. 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(3).  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   18  away from process and toward results and strategic outcomes. But our compensation system does not reflect that sophistication. (The Glossary of this paper offers a further discussion of this shift in conception of the term ""performance"" on page 74.) At the organizational level, we now understand that performance is the organization's success in achieving its mission; it is not the arithmetic average of individual employees' performance ratings, nor is it the sum of the organization's outputs and activities. At the individual level, we now understand that performance is not limited to how reliably a position's tasks are executed (such as the quality and quantity of a typist's output). Instead, individual performance can be measured and recognized in several ways. For example, an organization can evaluate an employee on the significance of his or her work, in addition to its objective quality, with rewards contingent on both the employee's contributions and the organization's success. Or an organization can evaluate and reward an employee for acquiring the competencies that truly make a difference in achieving expected results. Private sector organizations have recognized such options and created supporting compensation practices such as results-driven variable pay and pay linked to strategic competencies. With some exceptions, the Federal Government has not done so to any meaningful extent.3 Worse yet, the Federal Government does not provide clear, strong incentives for excellent task execution, let alone individual contributions or organizational success. We do not even have a functioning merit pay system, the prevalent mainstay of private sector compensation systems designed for the kind of professional4 white-collar knowledge work that now dominates the Federal Government. Some observers have noted a general interest coupled with a general hesitancy among public employers to adopt new models for pay design and delivery,5 and the most recent attempt at a governmentwide pay-forperformance system, the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) for Federal managers in grades GS13 through GS15, was abandoned nearly a decade ago. Unfortunately, that system was not replaced by another 3  4  5  Demonstration projects have tested such practices. Examples include merit pay in the Department of Commerce and contribution-based pay in the Department of the Air Force. However, attempts to make these practices more broadly available have not been successful. In the private sector, ""professional"" is a term of art that covers nonsupervisory work that is FLSA-exempt. The Federal counterpart is two-grade interval professional and administrative work, including occupations such as IT specialist, attorney, and budget analyst.

That message actually begins with the very structure of the General Schedule itself. OPM's research into non-Federal compensation practices shows that in private sector organizations carrying out similar kinds of work and recruiting similar talent, pay structures provide much more room for performance-based distinctions. The General Schedule uses a 30 percent range width (i.e., a GS grade's maximum rate equals 130 percent of its minimum rate). In contrast, our competitors' pay structures typically have range widths of at least 50 percent for professional positions, and ranges of 80 percent or more are common under paybanding systems.7 In effect, a ""pay band"" in the Federal sector is simply a normal salary range in the private sector. The General Schedule pay administration rules do have some pay-forperformance features. But these features do not make the current system a performance-oriented system. The Department of Energy's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, Timothy M. Dirks, put it this way: Greater flexibility is needed in calibrating pay to individuals' skills, contributions, and value to the enterprise. The current system is too rigid and does not provide the range of mechanisms needed to make meaningful distinctions.  Indeed, the way Government delivers pay increases  and the relative value of those increases  reinforces the message that performance is secondary at best. Consider that:  6  7  Those lessons included a recognition that creating a statutory entitlement to a predetermined base pay increase on the basis of an assigned summary performance rating, in combination with a statutory ban on limiting the use of rating levels  all in the name of ""fairness"" compared with the treatment of non-managerial employees under the regular General Schedule  produced substantially increased costs with no demonstrable benefit to the taxpayer. The performance management programs the agencies designed and operated remained largely focused on process measurement and at the termination of the system in 1993, five out of six PMRS employees were rated above ""Fully Successful.""

Promotion  placement in a position at a higher grade  results in an immediate pay increase and a substantial increase in long-term earnings, while outstanding performance at a particular level of work guarantees nothing. The Federal Government's tools for managing base pay are limited. Fundamentally, the pay system treats pay setting and pay adjustments as a series of binary decisions. Exceptions are permissible, but expected to be rare and may require higher level approval. Upon appointment, the pay system takes into account only the fact that the employee meets basic qualifications requirements  in our binary scheme, the employee is in a ""go"" status without further differentiation. Statute then specifies that the pay for a newly hired employee must be set at the minimum rate of the grade of the employee's position, unless the employee has unusually high or unique qualifications or the agency has a special need. An appointee with better than average qualifications still gets the minimum rate. Consequently, with rare exceptions, no differentiation can be made to relate starting pay to an incoming individual's performance capacity. After initial appointment, pay adjustments occur either within a grade's pay range, where the employee progresses further through the grade's fixed-step rates, or between ranges, when an employee is promoted to a higher grade. Here, too, the law establishes lock-step rules using ""go""/""no go"" judgments. - The primary means for adjusting an employee's relative position in a grade's pay range is the within-grade increase (WGI). The WGI is designed to reward experience and loyalty, not excellence, and is based on a judgment that the employee's work is of an ""acceptable level of competence""  again, a binary decision. There is no way to make base pay distinctions between a very good  but not outstanding  employee and a moderately good one; their WGIs are identical. The quality step increase (QSI), which accelerates movement through the range by awarding the next higher fixed-step rate in advance of the normal waiting period, is also available, but is limited to outstanding employees, and less than 4 percent of all General Schedule employees receive them. In contrast, many private sector and demonstration project approaches to managing within-range movement are designed to affect employees' relative position in the range,  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   21  and pay policies are often set to give only the best performers access to rates in the upper part of a range.8 - When an employee is promoted, statute again dictates the resulting pay adjustment. Promotions, particularly competitive promotions, are perhaps the strongest pay-for-performance linkage currently available. Nonetheless, the outcome is invariable and again of a binary character  the promoted employee is a ""go"" and given a predetermined payoff irrespective of relative performance or value to the agency. Pay-for-performance tools coexist with structural and time-based pay increases. This coexistence creates two problems. - First, it sends the message that pay will  and should  increase with the inflation that fuels wage increases  which drive structural adjustments  and with the passage of time. This message is reinforced by actual practice. In a typical year over the past decade, Federal employees received more and greater pay increases simply for remaining on the payroll than for meeting or exceeding performance expectations. The chart shown below illustrates this point.  The Role of Performance in Pay  Total increase in payroll as a result of increases to individual employees' pay: 7.1%  Over threefourths of that increase in total payroll was insensitive to performance  General increase and locality pay adjustments: 4.8%  Over half of the remaining 2.3% total payroll increase was also insensitive to performance Source: Central Personnel Data File  2000 General Increase + Locality Within Grade Increases Career Ladder Promotions Competitive Promotions Quality Step Increases  8  See Alternative Pay Progression Strategies: Broadbanding Applications, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC, April 1996.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   22  Of the total pay increases granted, those that are either completely automatic or essentially so  given their low threshold and predetermined size and distribution  are shown as the non-patterned wedges of this pie. They truly overwhelm the two forms of increase in the General Schedule system that provide some meaningful performance contingency: the competitive promotion and the QSI. Automatic and semi-automatic increases are artifacts of the fixed-step pay schedule: there is no way to not grant them when the President must issue pay tables with unique dollar amounts assigned to each grade and step. A General Schedule Federal employee's grade and step are known, rather than a precise annual salary. That latter value is derived through a look-up function tied to a published salary table, not through any considered judgment about the value of the employee's contributions or competencies. This year, the Government will distribute 5 billion dollars on these performance-insensitive pay adjustments and related benefits costs. An employee needs to do little, if anything, to earn these increases; they are essentially entitlements.9 In contrast, private sector companies take great pains to avoid creating pay entitlements and focus instead on the strategic leverage that pay delivery tools provide. - Second, the dominance of performance-insensitive pay increases makes performance-oriented tools appear trivial. For most employees, their timedriven increases have much more value than any awards or raises they receive for outstanding performance. Furthermore, the limited extent and impact of performance-sensitive pay is strongly at odds with a strategic human capital management perspective. In light of the limitations that constraining statutory system features impose, many Federal leaders with a General Schedule workforce may well have felt some frustration as they applied the General Accounting Office's self-assessment checklist for evaluating the effectiveness of their human capital management and scored the following item: 4. Compensation. Does the agency's compensation system help it attract, motivate, retain, and reward the people it needs to pursue its shared vision?  Look for: Indications that the agency has examined its compensation system and considered changes in light of its human capital needs, 9  This characterization is not rhetorical: statute, appeal rights, and case law make it quite clear that employees do, in fact, have a property right in these increases.

Evidence that consideration has been given to making compensation packages more competitive. . . . Industry benchmarks on compensation and information . . . on average salary and projected demand for given occupations.10  In these various, cumulative ways, the General Schedule pay system sends the subtle but unmistakable message  overriding any management protestations to the contrary  that performance is a secondary consideration at best. This phenomenon is documented more specifically in the seventh Closer Look: How the System Does  and Doesn't  Reward Performance (pages 5763), which examines the relative impact of performance alongside General Schedule system features like general increases, time, and position. Agency efforts to strengthen the linkage between pay and performance are undermined by the fiscal dynamics of the compensation system. One bright spot in the Federal compensation system is awards. When compared to other public sector employers, such as State governments, our awards system gives Federal agencies considerable flexibility to reward excellence through honorary recognition, cash, or time off. But few agencies offer the financial incentives commonly available in the private-sector, where employees may receive bonuses of several percent of salary or more.11 This is not surprising, because, as the earlier chart illustrates, our system requires Federal agencies to deliver a substantial amount of money through pay increases that are essentially automatic. For example, in 2000, General Schedule employees received a pay adjustment of approximately 3.7 percent of base pay,12 and more than one in every three General Schedule employees received a within-grade increase.13 Such increases do not merely send the message that performance is secondary. By absorbing the lion's share of annual personnel funding, they may effectively prevent agencies from suggesting otherwise through performance-based increases and lump-sum  10 11  12  13  Human Capital: A Self-Assessment Checklist for Agency Leaders, General Accounting Office (GAO/OCG-00-14G), Washington, DC, September 2000, p. 21.

In addition, Congress has on occasion curtailed the limited agency spending on performance-driven lump-sum cash awards that does occur  few agencies spend more than 1 percent of their basic payroll on awards. Such congressional action  usually carried out through the appropriations process and affecting only a few agencies at a time  can have a severe chilling effect on other agencies' use of these flexibilities to link pay and performance. This situation would need to change if the Government is to establish a meaningful performance culture. As recent events have shown all too clearly, Government performance is critically important, and we would be better served by a compensation system that reflects and reinforces this importance. Of course, it is also important to remember that any compensation system changes that increase an emphasis on a performance linkage will only succeed to the extent that credible, reliable measures of that performance are readily available. A rigorous performance management system that employees trust to make appropriate performance distinctions is the sine qua non for stronger linkages, both for setting clear expectations and accountability and for establishing measures that can bear the burden of driving pay decisions. Our eighth Closer Look: The Challenge of Performance Measurement (pages 6466) discusses this issue further. Past and present efforts aimed at improving financial management and information in the Federal Government will support efforts in this regard. The fact that Federal agencies do not have the luxury of refined accounting systems measuring a competitive bottom line or economic value added is finally fading as an excuse for not defining and measuring expected results. A results-focused, accountable Government operating effectively under the Government Performance and Results Act must know where it stands and how it has or has not improved.  If What We've Got Is Wrong, What Would Be Right? The Federal pay system needs to include improved mechanisms for addressing individual equity so that it could allow agencies to recognize and value the competencies and contributions of their employees better. The current system's narrow pay ranges, time-based pay progression rules, and across-the-board delivery of annual increases impair the Government's ability to use pay, and particularly adjustments to base pay, to communicate important values and goals and to reward results. The Government's ability to establish and sustain a performance culture is essential. Such a culture requires clear expectations and U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   25  robust measures that make meaningful distinctions across levels of performance and reinforce accountability. More importantly, however, that culture must be supported by a compensation system where those performance distinctions matter.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   26  An Excess of Internal Equity The Federal compensation system emphasizes internal equity at the expense of external equity and individual equity. The system does not permit Federal agencies to allow non-classification factors  such as the importance of the work to the employing agency, salaries paid by competing employers, and turnover rates  to influence base pay. The classification system's rigid quality defeats strategic human capital management and nimbleness. Most important, this internal equity emphasis limits the Government's ability to give external equity and individual equity their appropriate weight in compensation decisions.  The merit system principle governing Federal pay includes as its most familiar and most prominent precept that the Government should establish and maintain logical and equitable salary relationships inside the organization itself, stated as: Equal pay should be provided for work of equal value. . . .1  As noted earlier, this precept is known as internal equity. It is an indispensable element of fairness in the workplace and a core principle of every modern compensation system. But modern compensation systems balance this principle with two other principles, as discussed above: external equity (relating employee pay to external labor market rates) and individual equity (relating employee pay to the individual employee's contributions and results). The merit system principle clearly recognizes the need for balance, and its language contemplates all three forms of equity: internal, external, and individual. Unfortunately, the Federal compensation system does not achieve this balance: it emphasizes internal equity at the expense of external and individual equity. This overemphasis is reflected in: A rigid linkage between a position's value  as determined by classification2  and its grade; and A rigid linkage between a position's grade and the employee's pay.  1 2  5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(3). Here, ""classification"" refers to the Federal Government's job evaluation system, the General Schedule position classification system, which applies centralized criteria across all white-collar work to determine the proper occupational series, position title, and pay grade of each position.. This use of the term ""classification"" differs from private sector usage, where ""classification"" refers to a specific method of job evaluation. OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   27  In the Federal Government, job evaluation points = grade = base pay. Under this approach, job evaluation does not simply inform base pay; it dictates base pay. The system's architecture and guidelines do not permit Federal agencies to allow nonclassification factors  such as the importance of the work to the employing agency, salaries paid by competing employers, turnover rates, and added value derived from employees acquiring additional competencies applicable to the same level of work  to influence base pay, other than by notable exception. OPM's research into public and private sector compensation systems suggests that this situation is extraordinary. Even organizations that place a high value on internal equity do not implement it in such a confining manner.3 More important, the dominant rigidities of the classification system put strategic human capital management and nimbleness nearly beyond reach. The Government's emphasis on and implementation of internal equity creates several problems. First, it rewards and perpetuates hierarchy. Modern communications technology and more enlightened, empowering management practices have rendered the command-and-control paradigm an irrelevant and inefficient allocation of scarce resources. Past and present executive branch leadership has consistently called for agencies to use organization structures that are much more flat, responsive, and adaptable: To shrink the distance between citizens and Cabinet members, the Administration will flatten the Federal hierarchy, reduce the number of layers in the upper echelon of Government, and use work force planning to help agencies redistribute higher-level positions to front-line, service delivery positions that interact with citizens.4  On the surface, this inconsistency is surprising because the principle of ""equal pay for work of equal value"" is egalitarian, and using classification to value work seems to provide effective controls to limit the potential for unfettered ""empire building."" But our job evaluation system values work in a way that insistently encourages developing and maintaining organizational layers. For  3  4  One example is the State of Minnesota. Although internal equity is a primary value of Minnesota's compensation system, job evaluation is not the sole determinant of a position's grade. Job evaluation produces a preliminary grade, which may be adjusted upward or downward one or two grades based on staffing, market, or other considerations. (See ""State Employee Compensation,"" Office of the Legislative Auditor, State of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, February 2000, p. 13.)

APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   28  example, the classification system rewards supervision, by requiring  with very few exceptions  supervisory positions to be evaluated at least one grade higher than subordinate positions.5 And the three classification factors that carry the most weight in the classification of nonsupervisory jobs  knowledge required, supervisory controls, and guidelines  are all explicitly or implicitly related to a position's location in the organization's chain of command.6 Second, the internal equity emphasis limits the Government's ability to give external equity and individual equity their due weight in pay decisions. This limitation has both cultural and technical aspects. The cultural aspect is a continuing  though decreasing  reluctance to make pay distinctions between employees based on factors other than job value as measured by classification, as illustrated by the history and implementation of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. The technical aspect is that position carries more weight in Federal compensation than market pay or performance. Consequently, classification is more readily available  and much more powerful (in dollar terms)  than tools for making pay distinctions based on performance and labor market considerations. Congress has delegated to agencies the authority to classify positions. A manager can immediately increase an employee's pay substantially by getting the employee's position reclassified to a higher grade.7 The additional funding that the higher grade requires, particularly in future years, has often been provided automatically through centralized agency budgeting processes  like ""manna from heaven,"" as one manager put it. Providing an award or retention allowance of comparable value can prove much more difficult and may even require OPM approval.8 Finally, limiting the potential for performance and labor market distinctions to influence base pay has actually undermined internal equity, because a lack of adequate market- and performance-oriented compensation tools creates a strong incentive to misclassify positions. This paradox is illustrated in the final Closer Look: Classification  The Unintended Tool of Choice (pages 6768).  5 6  7  8  This oversimplifies the concept of ""base level of work supervised,"" but is generally accurate. These are the three dominant factors used under the Factor Evaluation System (FES), a point-factor job evaluation system. FES classification standards do not cover all occupations, but even non-FES standards use conceptually similar factors. Depending on the employee's grade and step, reclassification to a higher grade will usually result in an immediate pay increase ranging from 5 to 20 percent. For example, most agencies continue to require multiple internal approvals for substantial payments like significant retention allowances and large cash awards. For most agencies outside the Department of Defense, OPM approval is required for most cash awards of more than $10,000. OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   29  The outcome of these problems is a classification system that lacks credibility and is perceived by many as superfluous at best, a hindrance at worst. A recent, precipitous decline in the number of Federal classification specialists reflects broader trends such as reductions in staff functions, the replacement of HR specialists with HR generalists, and increased efficiency through automation.9 However, this decline  which shows no signs of reversal even as other human resources functions are being revitalized  can also be construed in part as a management commentary on the ""value added"" by classification. The recent OPM research on job evaluation suggests that many organizations are reassessing the costs and benefits of spending scarce resources to operate an elaborate job evaluation apparatus and drastically simplifying their processes.10 11 Another possible interpretation of the decline in Federal classifiers is that classification requires a decreasing degree of analysis and extent of expertise. This would certainly be true if classification has become, in many cases, a routinized exercise to justify a specific outcome (i.e., a desired grade and pay level) or  worse yet  a cynical ""game"" that is played by a few cagey and artful practitioners, instead of a careful analysis of work and a thorough, objective comparison of that work to established standards. These developments contribute to decreasing expertise and accuracy in classification  which will further erode the system's credibility and perceived value.  If What We've Got Is Wrong, What Would Be Right? Equal valuation of work with similar characteristics within an organization maintains internal equity, which is an appropriate and important part of any sound compensation system. However, the apparatus used to ensure internal equity must be credible and cost effective and add value. Although internal equity may over-dominate the current system  crowding out the ability to make useful judgments about external market rates and to reward performance  retaining some internal equity structure, grounded in job evaluation, would be critical to support fairness to employees. Some governmentwide framework for job evaluation would also be valuable to ensure accountability and transparency, as  9  10  11  An Occupation in Transition, ""Part I: Federal Human Resources Employment Trends"" U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC, September 1999.

U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   31  Conceptual Flaws, Tangible Problems The Government's approach to compensation management rests on the outmoded idea of the single ""correct"" answer. Maintaining a ""single employer"" model for pay has required the Government to retain a level of central management that is increasingly at odds with the world we live in. At the same time, striving for the single ""correct"" answer has slowed the Government's decision making ability to the point where often even ""correct"" answers cannot be made in a timely manner. And deviating from the ""correct"" answer is difficult to achieve and takes too long to be effective.  The problems in Federal white-collar pay and job evaluation are not simply a product of ineffective practices; they are also the product of the Government's approach to compensation management. That approach is one of centrallydesigned, uniform solutions based on thorough planning and analysis. It dates to the nationwide application of the General Schedule classification system, and it has persevered into the 21st century. Even as more pay flexibilities became available is the 1990s, the central system dominated and distributed the vast majority of payments employees received. This approach supplied and reinforced a powerful connotation to the phrase ""Government as a single employer""  underscoring the idea that there is a single, demonstrably correct solution to human resources management problems which every Federal agency should use. In the modern era of strategic human capital management and particularly for many areas of compensation management, that conception may have outlived its usefulness  because a single correct solution probably does not exist and because the search for the correct solution may result in untimely action.  The limits of ""single"" solutions Today few compensation problems are amenable to a ""single"" correct answer. In 1949, a ""single employer"" approach to pay system design and delivery made sense, for two reasons. First, the Federal Government was composed largely of clerical employees performing stable, routinized work. It had, if not a ""single employee,"" a highly homogeneous workforce. Second, there were practical arguments for central management of pay. In a ""Government of clerks,"" the expertise needed to design and administer a pay system was not widely distributed. The generally accepted models of personnel administration typically confined wage and salary APRIL 2002 U.S. OFFICE OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   32  administration to the comptroller's shop where labor economics models predicated on tenure as a surrogate for value cranked out annual salary budgets and controls. And uniform procedures and treatment reduced the possibility of administrative error and were more amenable to oversight and inspection. But now, neither reason holds true. The Federal Government's work and workforce are highly complex. Agencies perform diverse missions, with diverse workforces, and increasingly compete in different labor markets. A single approach to pay and job evaluation that closely specifies how agencies will evaluate work, how agencies will set and adjust individual salaries, and how agencies will move employees through pay ranges cannot realistically hope to accommodate this diversity. Congress has, on occasion, acknowledged the inadequacies of a monolithic approach to pay by giving selected agencies the authority to design pay and job evaluation systems specific to their unique missions and workforces. But strategic management of human capital would call for pay design and delivery tailored to the agency, mission, and workforce to become the rule rather than the exception. This view is supported by ongoing agency efforts to be released from the strictures of the current compensation system. An increasing number of Federal agencies have demonstrated that they have the capacity to design and manage their own compensation systems. Efforts have been made to address the problems of excessive centralization through delegation. This has worked well when the pay system and its tools are viable, as is seen increasingly with targeted recruitment and retention payments well planned and budgeted in advance. But delegation will be insufficient if the problem lies within the system itself; and, as noted above, our system with its myriad technical specifications is increasingly unable to accommodate Federal agencies' diverse demands.  The problem with searching for the ""correct"" solution Federal pay practices are implicitly assumed to be ""correct."" Once established, agencies must implement them as written, often with no or little room for judgment. For example, agencies must classify jobs in accordance with published classification standards, must provide within-grade increases in the amount and at the time specified by regulation, and must provide the annual pay raises specified by governmentwide pay tables.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   33  An agency that wishes to change these ""correct"" practices must prove the need to do so. And the burden of proof is high. For example, if an agency perceives a need to increase salaries for employees in a given occupation, that agency (and other agencies in the area) must prepare and submit a request for special salary rates.1 This request must document, in detail, the need for the special salary rate, including factors such as vacancy and quit rates, the nature of the existing labor market, and the inadequacy of existing pay and non-pay solutions.2 Similarly, to establish a personnel demonstration project,3 the agency must develop and submit a project plan that describes, in detail, the project's intended outcome, methods, measurable objectives, costs, and benefits.4 Then OPM must review and approve these submissions. A high burden of proof makes it easier for the Government to defend those few deviations from standard pay and job evaluation practices that are allowed. But that same burden of proof also makes it costly and difficult to change such practices when necessary and even when they offer improved strategic value. The planning and consultation a demonstration project requires can consume 2 years or more. The result is that the pay system is not nimble; even if the Government's response to change is technically appropriate, it may well be untimely. In its most recent annual report on locality pay, the President's Pay Agent raised questions about the process carried out under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), which in many respects is emblematic of the ""single"" and ""correct"" solution approach. The Pay Agent noted: . . . serious concerns about the utility of a process that focuses too much attention on locality payments and not enough attention on the differing labor markets for major occupational groups or the performance of individual employees.5  1  2 3  4 5  Consensus among affected agencies is not required, but a lack of consensus may signific that a special salary rate will be established.

Of course pay systems and decisions should be grounded in facts and analysis. But the Federal Government's current paradigm makes the pay system very inflexible and quite unresponsive. Addressing this shortcoming would require the Federal Government to broaden its conception of ""Government as a single employer."" This likely would entail acknowledging the limitations of centrallydesigned, uniform systems by establishing a more open framework  based on some core values and using some umbrella principles  and giving agencies greater flexibility to tailor pay systems and practices to their missions and strategic objectives. And that, in turn, would also require more openness to change  a greater willingness to adopt, modify, and discard pay systems and practices in the interest of effective strategic human capital management.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   35  Final Thoughts About the Timelessness of Merit Merit system principles, the foundation of the modern idea of a civil service, remain important today. Principles such as equity, procedural justice, and openness are essential to a sound public service. Agencies that have already moved outside the mainstream pay and job evaluation systems continue to use these principles effectively. As the Federal Government considers modernizing our compensation systems, merit system principles can remain our essential guides.  Even in a modernized pay system, the merit system principles, with their clear recognition of internal equity, external equity, and individual equity, can and should still serve as the fundamental drivers of Government action. These core  and remarkably timeless  principles sustain the vision that the Government remains a single employer in principle, if not in all areas of specific practice. Some particularly important lessons in this regard emerged from the research into Federal agencies that use pay systems outside the general title 5 model, either through demonstration projects or through independent authority granted by Congress. The first lesson is that when one looks across the entire Government, a significant portion of the Federal Government has already left the centralized system,1 so the notion that further change would disrupt a completely stabilized system is misplaced. Even more important, however, is the second lesson: when agencies operating under the merit system are free to do ""anything,"" they generally do sensible things.2 They own and adapt what makes sense for them and their missions. Managers are not given unfettered discretion to set and adjust pay, but operate within agency-specific rules and guidelines, including budget restrictions. And these agencies have in fact succeeded in using their pay and job evaluation systems to improve the strategic management of their human capital by aligning reward systems with strategic goals and mission accomplishment. Congress has recognized such successes by its actions to make permanent successful paybanding demonstration projects in the Navy and Commerce Departments.  1  2  HRM Policies and Practices in Title 5-Exempt Organizations, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC, August 1998.

APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   36  Aside from their specific directives related to pay, the merit system principles include other precepts that characterize our current systems. These constitute some extremely important elements that are ""right"" and that ought not to be jettisoned as ""wrongs"" are addressed. In particular, the merit system principles underscore important themes that compensation systems ignore at their peril. One such theme is the principle of what has come to be called procedural justice, whether expressed generally as ""all employees . . . should receive fair and equitable treatment"" 3 or spelled out in specific prohibited personnel practices. A great deal of the dense, rigid administrative detail that characterizes our current pay and job evaluation systems originated in the interest of procedural justice. The time may have come to recognize that this principle might be equally well served by simpler, more flexible practices designed to fit a particular organization and workforce. Nonetheless, honoring the procedural justice principle is essential to establish and maintain trust among employees about any core human capital management system. Another theme the merit system underscores is openness supported by effective communication. However arcane the Federal pay system may appear to outsiders, most Federal employees understand its basic design and deployment. Organizations crafting new compensation approaches learn quickly that the key to success is constant and consistent communication. The idea that employees should have a clear understanding about what they can expect to happen and what will affect the outcomes that impact them is particularly relevant for the pay systems and other strategic rewards programs that not only put food on the table, but also may subsidize transportation costs and finance educational expenses. Any strategic human capital management improvements an agency might hope to achieve with a refined strategic rewards approach could be at substantial risk if employees are left to divine its contingencies and payoffs on their own. It is appropriate to acknowledge and use the lodestone quality our merit system principles provide. Their core values and fundamental themes can serve well to keep the enormous diversity of Federal agencies, missions, and workforces on course, even as the Federal community sets out together to consider and explore possible system improvements.  3  5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(2). OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   37  Conclusion and Next Steps This White Paper paints a ""warts and all"" portrait of the current Federal pay system. OPM expects  and indeed genuinely desires  its honesty to provoke an equally honest discussion of the disturbing issues it raises. We have an outdated pay system  built on the firm foundation of the merit principles but fundamentally out of step with today's work and workplace and workforce. Continuing to muddle through with an uneven set of ""cans and cannots"" across the spectrum of Federal agencies is not a meaningful answer for attracting, managing, developing, and retaining the quality workforce needed to produce the critical results that the American people expect from their Government. Several valiant attempts have been made to ""fix"" specific problems  most recently the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA)  but these fixes ultimately fall short because they cannot overcome the underlying root problems. The question is not whether we can maintain the current system, the question is should we. As Sharon Barbee-Fletcher, Director of Personnel at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, put it: ""The system has outlived the time in which it was an effective way to do business. It is time for a more flexible approach."" So perhaps the hour has indeed come to start over, with a blank sheet of paper, and design a system that responds to 21st century organizational demands and makes sense for today's workers. The next steps in this journey will involve all the stakeholders in the public service community. OPM will circulate this pre-decisional White Paper widely and provide specific opportunities for any and all who wish to comment or submit ideas. The intent is to trigger a broad conversation about the future of Federal pay and job evaluation. In the coming weeks and months, OPM will invite interested parties  including agencies, employee unions, and other stakeholders  to participate in discussions. OPM anticipates a wide range of views will be shared and looks forward to these exchanges and the opportunity to learn about and identify our agreements, disagreements, and concerns. Only through such discussion will the ideas emerge to modernize the way the Federal Government pays its employees to respond to contemporary market conditions and employee concerns. Ultimately, OPM hopes to build consensus on possible new answers for Federal pay and job evaluation for the 21st century.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   38  Working together, guided by the merit system principles, OPM believes our shared goal can be to identify ways to improve the balance across internal, external, and individual equity to promote distributive justice while maintaining openness and procedural justice. By such means, we can ensure that the Federal compensation system will serve employees and agencies alike. The outcome can be a system that makes a significant contribution to achieving the strategic, results-driven Government that the Government Performance and Results Act envisions.

Simply put, ""It's not just about money any more."" Today's conception of reward systems has necessarily widened to include a spectrum of conditions that might be termed a ""reward environment."" The depth of this change in perspective was seen most clearly in May 2000 when the American Compensation Association reinvented itself as WorldatWork and adopted a ""Total Rewards"" approach. In the 1980s and 1990s, employers increased their sophistication in analyzing and delivering what their employees  and potential employees  valued. In particular, employers looked for answers to the conundrum of fighting turnover when they were already paying salaries well above the market. Some of the most telling research revealed that even well-paid employees will leave when competing employers offer a better total rewards package. Such a package might include a commitment to skill development or a clear sense of mission and well-trained leaders who recognize results or an opportunity to balance work and family responsibilities better. Increasingly, it has become clear that the battle for talent involves much more than highly effective, strategically designed compensation and benefits programs. While these programs remain critical, the most successful companies have realized that they must take a much broader look at the factors involved in attraction, retention and motivation. And they must deploy all of the factors  including compensation and benefits  to their strategic advantage.1  Federal agencies are also rethinking how they offer talented and highly-skilled employees and applicants the rewards that will engage and focus them on meeting strategic objectives. OPM has developed a Strategic Rewards Framework to aid agencies in their analysis and investment in employee rewards. Strategic rewards embrace everything that employees value in the employment setting, and the term refers to the complete bundle of employee reward elements. The framework uses  1  ""A Historical Snapshot,"" What is Total Rewards? WorldatWork, 2001, Online (URL: http://www.worldatwork.org/Content/About/aboutwaw-whatis-frame.html) OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   41  four quadrants that map the overall rewards environment agencies can manage and deliver, as depicted below:  Compensation  Base Salary  Variable Pay  Other Payments  Paid Time Off Support Processes  Benefits  Health Care  Retirement  Savings  Other Insurance Support Processes  Learning & Development  Training  Learning Experiences  Career Paths Support Processes  Work Environment  Work/Life Balance  Leadership  Performance Culture  Organizational Climate Support Processes  The top two quadrants of the framework are sometimes called transactional rewards because they include the tangible results of the agreement between the employee and employer. In this agreement, or transaction, the employee provides time, labor, and competencies in return for salary and benefits. (NOTE: OPM includes paid time off, or leave, in the compensation [i.e., pay] quadrant simply because leave is so closely tied to hours of work and related pay entitlements.) The framework's bottom two quadrants cover areas that are increasingly recognized as critical factors for employee satisfaction and retention. They are sometimes called relational rewards because they tend to represent the relationship (vs. the transaction) between employee and employer. Indeed, effective balanced scorecard measures of the employee perspective usually focus on these areas. And investing in relational rewards is not a matter of the employer being nice; it's a matter of being smart.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   42  Each quadrant also refers to support processes. These include related activities and services such as performance management, job evaluation, workforce planning, competency modeling and assessment, leadership development, work/life program implementation, and employee surveys and analysis. This conception is particularly noteworthy for the Federal Government because of the strengths and competitive edge we can achieve in the bottom quadrants. Agencies have flexible authorities to invest in learning and development, and the opportunities to develop and sustain a performance culture that also values work/life balance are strong assets for the Federal employer. Although many of these relational rewards compete for limited funds, there is little doubt about the payoff on that investment. The evidence is clear: people may join your organization for the pay, but they stay for the chances to develop and make meaningful contributions under strong leadership. Were the Government overnight to start paying at or above market salaries, we would still have to keep employees engaged through strategic investment in relational rewards. OPM has labeled this framework ""Strategic Rewards"" (vs. the more commonly applied ""Total Rewards"") to underscore the role its elements play in an agency's overall strategic management of human capital. A reward is ""strategic"" when: it is valued by employees (or job candidates) that the agency must attract, retain, and manage because they make a difference for meeting the agency's strategic goals and objectives; and the agency can use it to communicate and focus on those strategic goals and objectives, and to enhance its capacity to achieve them (e.g., by building skills and rewarding results).  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   43  A Primer on the General Schedule Reference: A System Whose Time Has Come  and Gone (page 9)  The term ""General Schedule"" denotes the major compensation structure for white-collar work in the Federal Government. The General Schedule covers more than 1.2 million Federal employees. The system has governmentwide rules and procedures for setting pay for newly hired employees, for increasing an employee's pay, for adjusting the overall pay structure based on comparison with outside pay levels, and for paying overtime and other sorts of premium pay (such as hazard pay). At the heart of the General Schedule is a job evaluation (position classification) structure that sorts jobs into classes of positions across 15 grade levels and hundreds of occupations. The grade levels are differentiated by the difficulty and responsibility of the work. The primary function of the job evaluation structure is to facilitate setting and adjusting pay, but this structure was designed to be useful in all aspects of human resources management, not just pay. For example, when Federal hiring was more centralized than it is now, the General Schedule job evaluation system helped channel applicants to agency jobs through a nationwide examining system. The General Schedule job evaluation system also serves as part of the framework for determining how employees are affected during lay-offs.  The General Schedule as a Pay Structure The term ""schedule"" also refers to the schedule of pay rates that make up the salary structure for white-collar work. Each of the 15 grades has a pay range of about 30 percent. (The actual dollar values in the pay ranges for each grade vary from one locality to another.) The pay range for a given grade (in a given locality) is the same for all agencies and for all occupations, except that OPM may increase the value of the pay range by establishing special salary rates for occupations and grade levels for which there is serious difficulty in hiring and retaining staff at the regular pay levels. Each pay range is divided into 10 specific rates of pay called ""steps."" An employee's pay generally has to be fixed at one of the steps. (There is an exception to this rule for managerial employees who were moved to the General  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   44  Schedule upon the termination of the Performance Management and Recognition System in 1993.) An employee moves upward from step to step after serving a prescribed waiting period and on the condition that performance is at an ""acceptable level of competence."" Governmentwide regulations specify that that level is reflected through assignment of a summary performance appraisal rating at Level 3 or higher. Generally, agencies describe Level 3 as ""Fully Successful."" In appraisal programs that use only two summary levels, Level 3 is sometimes referred to as ""Pass."" The law sets waiting periods for moving from step to step at 1, 2, or 3 years, depending on an employee's position in the pay range. An agency may accelerate step movement for a high-performing employee by awarding a Quality Step Increase.  $120,000  $100,000  $80,000 Step 10 Rate $60,000  $40,000 Step 1 Rate $20,000  $0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  2002 General Schedule Grade Ranges and Pay Rates (without locality adjustments)  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   45  Why Not Preserve the General Schedule? Reference: A System Whose Time Has Come  and Gone (page 9)  All the reform efforts of the last 50 years  including the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990  have left the General Schedule system intact. However, as the President and the Congress work to pursue good government policies and practices that improve management and accountability, OPM believes the time may have come for substantive reform that brings the era of the General Schedule to a close. Legitimate arguments can be made for maintaining the current General Schedule system. These include stability, cost containment, and a lack of agency readiness or capacity to design and implement an alternative. OPM recognizes the need to maintain the General Schedule in the absence of an alternative and to provide an orderly and well-managed transition to any new system. However, should the Government maintain the General Schedule simply because it is convenient? The Government Performance and Results Act  and, more broadly, the concept of performance-based government  holds Government programs and activities to a much higher test: they must ""add value"" by making a cost-effective contribution to mission accomplishment. For the reasons described below, the General Schedule system will not meet the ""value added"" test in the presence of a new framework for Federal compensation.  Culture First, the Federal Government is shifting its emphasis from inputs and processes to performance and results. A ""default"" compensation system that communicates  however subtly  that position is more important than performance will not support the cultural change needed to effect and reinforce this shift. For some organizations  such as those where employees have limited scope of action to directly influence organizational results and therefore emphasize process improvement  it may still be sensible to have pay and job evaluation systems in which internal equity predominates. It is one thing to allow an agency to consciously and deliberately establish such a system as a strategic choice. It is quite another to imply a priori that such a system is appropriate by making it the ""default.""  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   46  Second, maintaining two systems  with the implicit prospect of returning to the old system if the new system is unsuccessful  conveys the message that cultural change is optional. This message would undermine the Government's ability to use compensation strategically. This is amply illustrated by the Federal Government's experiment with pay-for-performance under the Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) in the 1980s. PMRS, which based pay increases on performance ratings, existed side-by-side with the traditional General Schedule practice of increases keyed to longevity. The existence of parallel systems proved distracting and counterproductive. First, many employees focused on whether they were ""better off"" under the new system, devoting more attention to their pay than to their performance. Second, some employees perceived that they had ""lost"" pay because they no longer received full withingrade increases  even when they had, in fact, demonstrably gained pay by receiving partial increases in advance of the within-grade increase schedule. The result was that PMRS failed to establish a credible link between pay and performance,1 and did not measurably improve Government performance.  Cost Even if it were desirable to maintain the General Schedule, it would not be particularly cost effective or practicable. The resources and effort needed to maintain the General Schedule system  which include developing precisely defined locality pay areas and adjustments, establishing and administering special rates, developing and applying classification standards, and day-to-day pay administration  are substantial and presume considerable numbers of employees are still covered by the system. Given the extent to which agencies have already left the regular General Schedule ranks  some estimates are as high as 20 percent  and the prospect that progressive agencies would take advantage of the opportunity to design and implement more strategic pay systems, the dwindling numbers of employees remaining under the General Schedule would quickly become a new drain on the system's credibility. Maintaining the General Schedule would not prove cost effective from another, broader perspective as well. This paper makes the case that the General Schedule system has limited capacity to provide strategic support to agency missions.

The General Schedule no longer meets that value-added test. Concerns about increased costs in the absence of the mechanical cost controls that the General Schedule's narrow pay ranges, fixed steps, and tightly scheduled within-range pay progression provide are not misplaced. However, the price of that control in the loss of strategic leverage discussed throughout this paper carries its own costs in human capital management terms. Experience from demonstration projects and other extra-title 5 systems indicates that the Government and its agencies can effectively use alternative cost control mechanisms such as salary increase budgets. In fact, such alternatives are better suited to supporting the integration of budget and performance that the Government Performance and Results Act envisions.

Valuing and acquiring talent in the labor market is much more complex than pricing and purchasing canned goods or packaged products. Nevertheless, all markets present the buyer with similar challenges: the need to be clear about what one is shopping for, the need to make intelligent comparisons among and between possible choices, the need to make decisions with incomplete price information, and the need to know when the price one is hoping to pay simply will not obtain the necessary level of quality. The processes the Federal Government is currently obliged to use to make pay decisions make it difficult to meet these challenges.  Labor market rates differ across occupations, not just grade and locality In the Federal system, grade is the major determinant of base pay. For example, all GS-12s are presumed equal: the Federal Government will pay GS-12 budget analysts, GS-12 attorneys, and GS-12 HR specialists the same amount of money unless agencies document the need to do otherwise. Most employers do not make this presumption, because they recognize that employees in different occupations are not interchangeable. For example, a GS-13 attorney is not a satisfactory substitute for a GS-13 biologist. Not surprisingly, labor markets reflect this reality: as shown in the charts on the next page, pay differences between occupations are often greater than pay differences between grades or localities.1 For example, in Atlanta, market rates for Occupation 1 at the GS-5 level are 35 percent higher than the market rates for Occupation 2 at the GS-5 level. However, the Federal process for determining whether and how much market prices have increased does not even price occupations in the labor market. It prices, instead, the Federal job classification system itself by superimposing the Government's internal equity structure onto the non-Federal jobs it looks at. Under current methods, when a non-Federal job is sampled, a determination is made about which of the 15 GS grades the sampled job would hold if it were a Federal job. Then the process rolls up the data for all the samples in a grade and 1  Locality remains important; some areas, such as San Francisco, appear to have uniformly higher labor costs.

This result loses all clarity about what one is shopping for  a grocery shopper would not find such rolled-up price data (i.e., the average price of myriad items in the store) helpful in knowing what to pay for meat or milk or soap.

In other words, not all IT specialists  or secretaries or nurses or engineers  are equal. Employees are not interchangeable; their skills, strengths, and performance vary. Labor markets recognize this fact. A professional recruiter, noting that job titles are less important than skills and performance, describes how this has changed his approach to interviewing  and valuing  job seekers: I used to look at the title. Now I just ask, ""What exactly do you do?""2  The Federal Government has become more willing to acknowledge and act on skill- and knowledge-based distinctions. One example is the establishment of special salary rates for support employees with office automation skills. Another, more recent example is the establishment of special salary rates for attorneys and accountants performing work directly related to the securities industry. This is a move in the right direction. But our system assumes that a given occupation or skill has a fixed, continuing value.3 This assumption is problematic, for two reasons. First, skills may be valuable only in combination with other skills. Second, skills do not necessarily hold their value over time: they may lose their value if the employee does not maintain currency, if employers' needs change, or if technology changes. In such a situation, flexibility is required to adjust pay levels sensibly, e.g.., by adjusting the pay ranges for some occupations by a smaller percentage than for other occupations, while offering employees the opportunity to acquire more valuable skills. It could be useful to be able to go beyond narrow, predetermined categories like pay grade when necessary to make intelligent pay choices.

In theory, special salary rates (SSRs) are subject to ongoing reappraisal and adjustment. Pending enactment of the President's proposed Managerial Flexibility Act, regulations require annual review of SSRs, and there are strong disincentives for abolishing them.

However, we lack the ability to create similar differentials based on performance, because our pay ranges are too narrow and our pay progression rules too restrictive. It could be useful to be able to make intelligent choices about paying within the market range for a set of skills and for the value added by high-performing employees.  Labor markets can change rapidly Market rates are the product of supply and demand. Supply and demand are, in turn, influenced by factors including economic conditions, business opportunities, and technological changes. The result is that labor markets are dynamic. Market rates do not necessarily move in the steady, predictable manner suggested by broad indices such as the Employment Cost Index. This dynamism is amply illustrated by two ""reports from the front"" in the information technology (IT) industry: IT professionals of all ranks are having another big year.

It is the tool Congress has provided to address external equity anomalies. Through special salary rates, OPM can take steps to ensure that Federal rates are competitive enough in the labor market to ensure adequate staffing. OPM can target special salary rates to a particular group of employees defined by occupation, location, grade, and other appropriate factors. Performance is not a factor in establishing special salary rates, since the underlying General Schedule pay system is not designed to address the performance of individual employees through scheduled pay adjustments. The current special salary rate authority, however, is limited in its usefulness  primarily because special salary rates still operate within the General Schedule system. Special salary rate employees are still subject to General Schedule paysetting and pay progression rules. They are classified in a GS grade, and their pay is set at a fixed GS step. Movement through the rate range is still largely driven by time in grade, with performance (individual equity) having little influence. When a special salary rate schedule is approved, all covered employees at a given grade receive the same pay increase regardless of their performance. In contrast, private sector employers typically have an open pay range instead of fixed longevity-based steps. Thus, an increase in the pay range (i.e., increases in the range's minimum rate and maximum rate) to respond to labor market demands does not necessarily translate into pay increases for all current employees in that pay range. Private sector employers can adjust individual pay rates by taking into account individual performance, skills, or contributions. Mediocre performers may receive no increase at all, as their value in the labor market may not warrant a pay increase. In recent years, OPM has acted to make special salary rates in the General Schedule system more focused and responsive. OPM has sought to accelerate the approval process and has provided agencies with greater levels of assistance. Nevertheless, special salary rates remain challenging to administer and difficult to terminate, as documented in a previous OPM study of special salary rates.1 1  The Use of Special Salary Rates in Federal Agencies, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, March 1996.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   54  Although legislation has been proposed as part of the President's Managerial Flexibility Act to correct many shortcomings of the current special salary rates program, this proposal cannot address problems that are rooted in the General Schedule pay system itself. It could be useful for the Federal Government to have a more competitive and flexible pay structure that can address external and individual equity more effectively. If the Federal employee pay system were to be redesigned to place more emphasis on both external and individual equity, there might be less need for ""special"" solutions. Market-based adjustments could be part of the normal pay-setting process. Individual performance, skills, and contributions could play a stronger role in adjusting an employee's pay. There might, therefore, be less need for special rates. If, however, a subset of jobs still experienced severe recruitment or retention problems, those jobs could be placed in a separate category or covered by a special salary range or pay supplement.

Reference: The System Is Market Insensitive (page 16)  Although this report documents numerous problems with the General Schedule structure and the existing pay comparability system, the idea of comparability should not be abandoned. The Federal Government cannot recruit, manage, and retain the talent needed to perform its missions and functions unless it can provide an attractive employment package, which includes a competitive salary. Our system's current approach to comparability promises much. The statute governing pay comparability states that ""any existing pay disparities between Federal and non-Federal employees should be completely eliminated.""1 This statement has no qualifiers; it does not say that we will eliminate some disparities, for some employees, on some occasions. Thus, ""comparability"" appears to be a promise from the Federal Government to the individual employee. The difficulty is that the Federal Government defines and implements comparability in a collective manner. An individual employee's market value  and thus any gap between his or her current pay and that value  is the product of many variables, including level of work, locality, occupation, credentials, skills, and accomplishments. But the locality pay system accounts for only two variables  level of work and locality. Consequently it does not  and cannot  precisely determine what individual occupations, specialties, or employees should be paid. The result is that the Federal Government does not deliver on the promise of comparability under the current white-collar pay system, because it cannot reliably make market comparisons that are meaningful for the purpose of setting and adjusting the pay of actual jobs. Agencies  convinced they cannot offer employees ""fair market rates"" for their occupations  have sought authority to leave the General Schedule.2 Therefore, new approaches to comparability probably should be explored. The merit system principle about pay says only to take into consideration other national and local rates of pay. The precise form of that consideration is left undefined. The statutory language of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability  1 2  5 U.S.C. 5301(4). This occurred most recently when Public Law 107-123 was enacted allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop its own pay system consistent with related Federal agencies subject to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA).  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   56  Act (FEPCA) offers only one operationalization of such consideration or comparison  namely, the calculated disparity between General Schedule and non-Federal white-collar pay rates. Others are certainly possible and worth examining. The lessons of FEPCA include much that has been learned about the resources that extensive salary surveys require to calculate gaps that leave many users and observers still dissatisfied with the results. Possible alternative approaches to addressing the issue of comparability and establishing competitive pay approaches might include: At the governmentwide level, a commitment to providing a competitive pay structure  one that enables agencies to set employee pay at competitive levels without resorting to extraordinary measures; and At the agency level, a commitment to monitoring market rates and employee compensation levels  and making appropriate pay adjustments  so that employees can be fairly and competitively compensated.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   57  How the System Does  and Doesn't  Reward Performance Reference: The System Is Performance Insensitive (page 23)  To recruit and retain the talent it needs, the Federal Government points with pride to its merit system principles and their promise that excellence will be rewarded. The reality for employees, however, is somewhat different, and it does not take a new employee long to discover that time and uniform treatment dominate the pay system. For some employees, the prospect of reliable  if not immediate  rewards for steady  if not stellar  performance is a completely acceptable employment relationship. Unfortunately, these systemic properties put the Government at a disadvantage when trying to attract and retain top-flight employees who may expect more timely recognition of their achievements and who keep a careful eye on whether and how the agency also rewards their colleagues who may contribute less to meeting the agency's goals and objectives. The pay system's limitations and counterintuitive dynamics can have perverse effects on employees. System properties that may have been sensible for a homogeneous workforce of clerks with little latitude to make different performance contributions now have serious unintended consequences for present and prospective employees. Characteristics that may have been established in the interests of precluding administrative error (e.g., fixed-step pay rates) leave employee and employer unable to move beyond rigidities that prevent pay distributions that properly reflect differences in performance. The following examples illustrate how these systemic features affect employees, undermine the promise to reward merit, and send conflicting messages instead.   The Distant Relationship Between Pay and Performance The General Schedule system does not permit an agency to send strong messages about performance through base pay. The outcome is that even mediocre employees can prosper, and a better performer will not necessarily get better pay. In fact, as shown below, the system, even when applied properly, can pay an indifferent employee more than a good one. The only way that an agency could avoid this outcome would be to abandon rewarding outstanding performance through base pay  which would also be unsatisfactory and inconsistent with the general pay-related merit principle.

The agency made full use of performance-based salary tools; it granted a quality step increase (QSI) when possible and denied a within-grade increase (WGI) when possible. At the start of the 5-year period, both employees occupied grade 12 General Schedule positions and were paid at GS-12, step 4. The employees remained in these positions throughout the 5-year period. Both employees were located in Washington, DC. Pay changes took effect at the end of the year. Thus, Employee A's QSI affected the Year 2 salary, but not the Year 1 salary. Begin Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 End Employee A Salary: $48,906 Rating: 5 Employee receives QSI Rating: 3 Rating: 3 Employee receives WGI Rating: 2 Employee B Salary: $48,906 Rating: 4 Rating: 4 Employee receives WGI Rating: 4 Rating: 4 Employee receives WGI Rating: 4  Rating: 2 WGI denied Average rating: 4.0 Average rating: 3.0 Salary: $62,013 Salary: $62,013 Cumulative salary: $270,982 Cumulative salary: $267,824  The employee whose performance actually deteriorated during this period ""earned"" more pay than the employee who maintained a record of good performance. We expect good performers to sustain their efforts even when less effective colleagues keep pace and can occasionally move relatively higher in the pay range through time-driven WGIs. The system almost seems predicated on employee inertia that will keep the better employees in place even during those periods when their base pay may lag somewhat.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   59   How Time Trumps Performance The following observation about needed changes in Federal civil service systems suggests that our pay system should adopt an increased performance orientation: [Civil service] reforms should include placing greater emphasis on skills, knowledge, and performance in connection with federal employment and compensation decisions, rather than the passage of time and the rate of inflation, as is often the case today.1  It is not apparent why time and inflation should overshadow skills, knowledge and performance: the merit system principles governing Federal human resources management do not state that the Federal Government should or must compensate employees for years on the job or changes in either the cost of living or the cost of labor. But this is, in fact, the current reality. As shown on the next page, base pay increases are driven primarily by changes in the pay structure and the employee's time on the job. Performance plays almost no role in pay increases for the average performer and only a limited role in pay increases for the exceptionally good performer.  Assumptions Both employees were rated under a 5-level system, with 5 being the highest possible rating. The agency made full use of performance-based salary tools, and granted a quality step increase (QSI) when possible. If it was possible to grant both a WGI and a QSI, the agency did so. At the start of the 5-year period, both employees occupied grade 11 General Schedule positions and were paid at GS-11, step 2. Both employees were located in Washington, DC.  1  David Walker, Comptroller General of the United States, testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, July 17, 2001.

Average rating: 4.4 Increase in salary: +$14,891 % of increase resulting from: General increases: 55% Longevity (WGI): 27% Performance (QSI): 18%  How did this phenomenon come about? The situation has its roots in efforts to make Federal pay more rational and objective, which produced two hallmarks of the Federal white-collar pay system: the periodic within-grade increase (WGI) and across-the-board pay increases. The WGI was designed to reward employees for increasing their value to the organization. The WGI is based on the theory of the ""learning curve""  the idea that an employee will become more productive (and thus more valuable) as he or she learns the organization's subject matter and work processes. But WGIs are not based on a rigorous measurement of employee productivity. Instead, the WGI uses a ""waiting period"" as a proxy for increased value. Unfortunately, the assumptions underlying this practice  that value always increases with experience and that the increase does not vary across employees  are questionable. So it is no longer clear that WGIs reflect or reward increased performance, but it remains very clear that they reflect the passage of time. Across-the-board pay increases are intended to establish and maintain fair and competitive pay levels. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   61  (FEPCA) established two types of increase:2 the general increase and locality adjustments. These increases are delivered automatically and uniformly3 to General Schedule employees. In effect, the Federal Government uses changes in the Employment Cost Index and changes in salaries in large, geographic areas as a proxy for changes in an individual employee's ""market value."" As with WGIs, the assumption underlying this practice  that an employee's ""market value"" is independent of occupation, skills, and level of performance  is questionable. So it is not clear that an employee's structural pay increases reflect changes in his or her actual ""market value""  but it is clear that they reflect the historical rate of labor market inflation. The result, from both a financial and employee perspective, is that time carries more weight in pay decisions than does performance. The history of the Federal pay system makes this understandable, but it does not make it appropriate or acceptable for today's performance-oriented government.   The Relative Rewards of Better Performance vs. Better Position For the employee who defines ""advancement"" solely in terms of increased financial rewards, the path to that advancement is clear: the pay system will not reward improving performance to meet outstanding standards, irrespective of its relevance to the agency's strategic objectives, as much as it will reward merely acceptable performance at the next higher level of work. Even allowing for the fact that the higher level work requires greater skill or has more responsibility that merits greater pay, the agency must still grapple with the challenge of keeping and motivating top performers at the other work level on the front line, where more direct impact on desirable results may be achieved. The illustration that follows shows why this is so. Even using unrealistic ""best case"" assumptions to make performance as rewarding as possible,4 performance remains much less lucrative than promotion. Moreover, when OPM analyzed how performance and schedule adjustments contribute to pay increases, performance finished  at best  in a  2  3  4  Technically, these changes are adjustments rather than increases. In theory, they can be negative; in practice, they are not. There are some exceptions. For example, employees on pay retention and employees covered by a special salary rate may receive a lesser increase. It is uncommon for a Federal employee  even an outstanding one  to receive both a within-grade increase and a quality step increase in the same year. It is highly unlikely that this would happen twice, or that an employee would receive QSIs 5 years in a row. (It is much more probable that the outstanding employee would simply receive withingrade increases  in which case the employee's salary would increase no faster than that of his or her merely satisfactory peers.)  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   62  dead heat with schedule adjustments. Why does this happen? First, because the pay structure and pay-setting rules make position (raises through promotion) more valuable than performance (raises due to high performance). Second, because structural increases are independent of performance and are delivered across-the-board. Finally, because the current system limits performance-based pay increases to an annual level that will rarely exceed the annual structural increase. Thus, the pay system strongly encourages employees to seek promotion. This is not illogical: in theory, incentives for promotion support efficient use of human capital by channeling the best employees into higher graded positions which will, presumably, put their abilities to better use than less demanding, lower graded positions. And this system has often served the Government and its employees very well. The Federal Government has many employees who have ""worked their way up"" to high-level positions, where they serve with distinction. But our system's overwhelming incentive to seek promotion appears increasingly problematic. First, restructuring agencies and shifting resources to front-line work will, over time, reduce the number of available managerial and quasimanagerial5 positions  traditionally the highest-graded positions in the General Schedule. Retaining a strongly promotion-oriented pay system in this context will, at best, generate frustration when employees who aspire to promotion face a lack of opportunities. At worst, it will discourage the reengineering and delayering needed to achieve the leaner, flatter structures that increasingly characterize modern, more strategically shaped organizations. Second, it is difficult to argue that a system that so strongly encourages an employee to devote substantial attention to ""the next job""  at the possible expense of the job at hand  is truly performance- or results-oriented.  5  ""Quasi-managerial"" positions include positions in policy, internal coordination and control, and administrative functions such as budget and human resources.

Its predictability and control as positives are starting to be heavily outweighed by the strong negative of denying employee performance its relevant place in determining pay.

APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   64  The Challenge of Performance Measurement Reference: The System Is Performance Insensitive (page 24)  The success of a performance-oriented compensation system depends heavily on the quality of the underlying performance management system. A universal challenge in performance management is establishing and communicating credible and reliable measures of performance, whether at the organizational, work unit, or individual level. Informed observers of Government agree that the rigor and quality of Federal agency performance management  and performance measurement in particular  is uneven at best. Nevertheless, OPM believes it may be time to establish a governmentwide framework for making pay distinctions based on performance  whether or not agencies are fully prepared to use this framework. Such a framework could be critical to making Government more performance- and results-oriented, as envisioned in the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), for two reasons. First, the Government needs to convey to its employees an unequivocal message that performance matters. For this message to be credited as more than rhetoric, however, the compensation system would need to reinforce it. To that end, basing all pay increases on performance may need to become the rule rather than the exception. But this approach could well fail unless the Government makes rigorous performance standards and measures a precondition for any performancedriven system. Second, linking pay to performance will focus agency and employee attention on performance management. This could create a strong and much-needed incentive for agencies to improve how they measure and manage performance, as some have noted: The new President and Congress should reconsider the issue of pay for performance within the federal government. For a performance appraisal system to have real meaning, there must be real consequences. Tying pay to performance by a management that is committed to performance makes the system real.1  1  Angela M. Antonelli and Peter B. Sperry, editors, A Budget for America, Heritage Foundation, Washington, DC, 2000, p. 341. OF PERSONNEL  U.S. OFFICE  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   65  This is also the perspective of the private sector, which links pay to performance as a matter of principle.2 At an absolute minimum, nearly all private sector firms have a merit pay program for their professional3 and managerial employees that links base pay increases to performance ratings.4 Our approach  across-theboard general increases and time-based increases  is almost unheard of.5 This is not to say that merit pay is always appropriate or effective. Ineffective merit pay systems can produce the same muted pay distinctions and lack of credibility that afflict our current system. But they do, at least, send the message that pay depends on performance, although the reality may fall short of the ideal. High-performing organizations emphasize the need to differentiate levels of performance and to take actions based on those differences. The Federal Government's practices in this area, while perhaps understandable in some respects, are impossible to defend. Many agencies have basically drained all meaning from the label ""Outstanding"" by applying it to such large proportions of their workforce that no connotation of ""standing out"" remains. Performance rated as better than fully successful starts as low as the 20th percentile in many agencies. The dynamics that contribute to rating inflation are well known, particularly the perceived, although not substantiated, impact on retention standing in a reduction-in-force and the desire not to disadvantage employees when ""everyone else is doing it"" (i.e., inflating ratings). Perhaps a more daunting and insidious cultural dynamic that mitigates against effective differentiation comes from the rigidities of our pay system with its predefined and undifferentiated payouts from general increases, within-grade increases, and career ladder promotions. Managers who might be inclined initially to differentiate levels of performance among their employees get little or no payoff. As noted elsewhere in this paper, they are extremely limited in their ability  2  3  4  5  Some organizations have adopted a total quality management approach and do not link pay to individual performance. These are few, and are concentrated in manufacturing and other process-centered industries. In this context, ""professional"" refers to salaried employees whose work involves the application of specialized knowledge. ""Professional"" includes, but is not limited to, employees in occupations with a positive educational requirement. The Federal counterpart is employees in two-grade interval positions. Research indicates that merit pay can be problematic. Criticisms include cost, a lack of credibility in supporting performance measures and evaluations, and limited pay differentiation between high and average performers, particularly in times of low inflation. Yet merit pay remains prevalent: private sector organizations link pay to performance as a matter of principle to communicate and reinforce performance as a core value, even if the mechanism is flawed. And few organizations that discontinue merit pay programs abandon the idea of linking pay to performance. Instead, they take steps to strengthen the linkage. The trend is to make more pay contingent on organizational and individual performance, not less.

Indeed, many agencies appear to operate under the principle that the awards amounts are so small that the prudent course is to distribute them widely and evenly and thereby avoid disputes. OPM's hopes in this arena rest with the continued implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 throughout Government and its integration with the strategic management of human capital. As organizational performance measurement improves, OPM is confident that agencies will continue to improve employee performance measurement as well. There can be no turning back from the shift to measuring results. Agencies increasingly are paying attention to these issues and looking to improve the ways they plan and measure employee results as well as program results. These efforts can be expected to continue, and OPM is committed to supporting them.6 Performance-oriented pay that communicates and reinforces what is important and provides the ""appropriate incentives and recognition . . . for excellence in performance""7 that the merit system contemplates can work effectively only when trusted, credible measures of that performance are available.  6  7  See A Handbook for Measuring Employee Performance: Aligning Employee Performance Plans with Organizational Goals, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC, September 2001. 5 U.S.C. 2301(b)(3).

Historically, managers have been given only one tool to deal with a variety of situations across the bulk of populations  merit pay. This is akin to the master carpenter giving an apprentice a hammer and then trying to teach him to build something: Everything the apprentice looks at appears to be a nail.1  Although the compensation consultant quoted above was discussing the private sector, his remarks are equally applicable to the Federal Government, with one important difference: substitute ""classification"" for ""merit pay."" The example below illustrates why classification is the ""hammer"" of the Federal pay system. Suppose an agency has two employees in a work unit who occupy the same position. As is typical in the Federal Government, both were hired at the first step of the grade level. One employee is a recent hire but an excellent performer; the other employee has been on the rolls for many years, but is an average, although still acceptable, performer. Consequently, the senior employee is paid considerably more than the junior employee. Using the terms of the merit system principle, their work is not of equal value to the organization. What can the agency do about the disconnect between these employees' salary levels and their levels of performance and contribution? Very little, with existing pay-forperformance provisions.2 Promoting the first employee through reclassification appears much more promising. First, there is a manifest difference in the two employees' work. Second, promoting the better performer will help bring the employees' compensation in line with their relative contributions by placing the better performer in a higher graded  and thus better paying and higher status  position. But a problem lurks: as every classifier knows, matters such as  1  2  Todd M. Manas, CCP, ""The Compensation Carpenter,"" Workspan, vol. 44, No. 9, WorldatWork, Scottsdale, AZ, September 2001, p. 8. A quality step increase will not erase the disparity, although it could reduce it. Retention allowances may not be granted solely on the basis of performance.  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   68  workload, quality of work, and results are not classification factors under our statutory system.3 So the problem is not simply that the only tool available is classification; the problem is that the only tool available is misclassification. And the incentives to misuse classification are not only financial; they are also cultural and include the following: Ease of budgeting. Although changes are developing in this regard, the fact remains that under an FTE-based system, the budget process tends to focus on the number of employees. If an FTE is approved, the associated salary may be fully funded, or at least is not subjected to intense scrutiny. Awards and retention allowances, on the other hand, have often been viewed as incremental and nonessential expenses. Ease of justification. Rewarding excellence through a cash award or a quality step increase is discretionary. Thus, the agency must decide to reward the employee, document the performance, and justify the expenditure. In contrast, to promote an employee through classification, the agency must simply document the existence of a sufficient amount of higher level work. If that work exists, payment is automatically justified by the principle of ""equal pay for equal work"" and the associated requirement to classify positions accurately and pay employees accordingly. Acceptability. Our compensation system places a high value on fairness and internal equity. This has created an organizational culture where pay distinctions based on ""objective"" factors such as classification are less controversial than pay distinctions based on ""subjective"" factors such as managers' assessments of employee performance. Consequently, misclassification  although inappropriate  may be much less controversial than openly making and rewarding performance distinctions. The point is not that agencies may be abusing the current classification system. The point is that agencies should not be forced to choose between complying with law and merit principles and managing their workforce effectively.  3  The classification factor of ""scope and effect"" is conceptually related to results. However, it has relatively little weight, and is evaluated in the abstract.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   69  Glossary ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCREASE  An equal flat rate (dollars and cents) or percentage increase in salary given to every eligible employee. Also known as a general increase. Something given (e.g., cash or a certificate) or an action taken (e.g., granting time off with pay or holding a ceremony) to provide an incentive or recognition for individual or group achievements that contribute to meeting organizational goals or improving the efficiency, effectiveness, or economy of the Government. Examples of specific types of awards include: honorary award, informal recognition, time off award, performance award, special act or service award, onthe-spot award, group incentive, suggestion award, referral bonus, and travel savings incentive. The basic cash compensation that an employer pays for the work performed, typically expressed as an annual salary. Also referred to as basic pay, which generally means an employee's regular and recurring base pay excluding irregular payments such as overtime pay. In some contexts, ""basic pay"" has different definitions for different purposes. When pay is used as the basis for computing another payment or benefit, it is basic pay for that purpose. In statute, a class (of positions) contains all positions that are so similar in their type and level of work that they can be treated similarly for all human resources purposes. Essentially, a ""class"" includes all jobs in the same grade and the same occupation. (The word ""class"" is not used often by Federal HR workers.) The Office of Personnel Management produces standards and guidance agencies must use in placing positions in their correct classes.  AWARD  BASE PAY  CLASS  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   70 CLASSIFICATION  A hierarchical structure of jobs, usually arranged into classes or pay grades according to some form of job evaluation. Also the term generally used to describe the Federal Government's job evaluation system. Generally, all forms of financial returns and services employees receive as part of an employment relationship. Historically the term included benefits such as insurance and retirement income plans like annuities. More commonly today, practitioners refer to benefits design and administration separately and use ""compensation"" to denote only the various forms of pay, including equity pay, the employer may offer as part of a broader strategic or total rewards design. Under the Federal compensation statutes, the results of position classification are so rigidly tied to employee pay that the term ""compensation"" is sometimes construed to cover both pay and job evaluation.  COMPENSATION  EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX (ECI)  A number of statistical measures published quarterly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure changes in specified non-Federal compensation. ECIs for different quarters are used to adjust the General Schedule and the Executive Schedule. A general term denoting fairness and the means and criteria established to ensure fairness. Equity is properly distinguished from equality, which more often connotes uniformity. NOTE: In compensation practice, the term equity pay applies to forms of compensation that publicly traded private sector corporations offer as financial rewards  usually stock options (i.e., equity in the company) provided to executives and managers and increasingly to other employees as well  to promote risk sharing and engage employee commitment.  EQUITY  E  XTERNAL  E  QUITY  A fairness criterion that directs an employer to set pay levels based on comparisons with rates prevailing in external markets for an occupation.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   71 INDI VIDUAL  E  QUITY  A fairness criterion that provides a guideline for employers to set salary rates for individual employees (people on the same job, in the simplest case) according to individual variation in merit. Also sometimes referred to as contribution equity. A fairness criterion that directs an employer to set pay rates that correspond to each job's relative value to the organization. The pay reform legislation that made several changes in the way pay is set for the white-collar Federal workforce covering a broad range of compensation issues, including locality pay, pay for administrative law judges and Boards of Contract Appeals, a new aggregate limitation on pay, higher pay for critical positions, interim geographic adjustments for New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, law enforcement officer special pay entitlements, recruitment and relocation bonuses and retention allowances, senior level pay, expanded special rate authority, supervisory differentials, time off as an incentive award, payment for academic degree training, travel and transportation expenses for interviewees and new appointments, and higher uniform allowances. The classification and pay system for most white-collar employees in the Federal Government. The pay structure for the General Schedule has 15 grade levels, with 10 salary steps at each grade. Positions are classified using governmentwide standards to determine their proper occupational series, title, and grade within the General Schedule. Each of the 15 grades in the General Schedule represents a unique band of difficulty and responsibility and is defined in statute at 5 U.S.C. 5104.. Grades are the same across different occupations, so that a GS-7 secretary, a GS-7 engineer, and a GS-7 photographer are in positions of equivalent difficulty and responsibility. Each of the 15 grades is defined in statute (the definitions were written in 1949). In the General Schedule system, grade also is used to mean level of work.  INTER  NAL  E  QUITY  FEDERAL EMPLOYEES PAY COMPARABILITY ACT OF 1990 (FEPCA)  GENERAL SCHEDULE (GS)  GRADE  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   72 GRADE INTERVAL ""T WO-GRADE INTERVAL"" RADE INTERVAL""  ""ONE-G  The terms ""two-grade interval"" and ""one-grade interval"" refer to the differing patterns of career advancement through a sequence of General Schedule grades. The two basic patterns reflect a basic distinction between the two general kinds of white-collar work covered by the General Schedule. Two-grade interval work generally comprises jobs in the professional and administrative occupational categories, and promotions are granted in two-grade increments from grades GS-5 through 11 and in one-grade increments at GS 12 and beyond. One-grade interval work generally comprises jobs in the clerical and technical occupational categories, and promotions are granted in one-grade increments. These two labels perform roughly the same function that ""exempt"" and ""non-exempt"" tend to have in the private sector as a short-hand way to distinguish higher level ""professional"" work and lower-level clerical and technical work. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) did not apply to the Federal Government when the General Schedule was established. Therefore, the FLSA categories do not serve, in the Federal compensation environment, as a basic distinction upon which the pay structure is built.  JOB EVALUATION  A formal process by which management determines the relative value to be placed on various jobs within the organization. The end result of job evaluation consists of an assignment of jobs to a hierarchy of grades or some other hierarchical index of job value. Job evaluation is most closely associated with the criterion of internal equity. Job evaluation methods can focus on the position being evaluated, irrespective of any information about its market value, or determine the market price of that work among other employers, or use some combination. The Federal Government's job evaluation system relies on the first method in its position classification system.  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT  APRIL 2002   73 LOCALITY PAY  Supplemental locality-based payments in addition to the rate of basic pay that apply in the 48 contiguous States in areas where non-Federal pay exceeds Federal pay by more than 5 percent. Most Federal employees  including GS, SES, and SeniorLevel employees, but excluding blue-collar employees and officials paid under the Executive Schedule  are eligible for locality pay. A locality pay area is a geographic area that serves as the basis for setting pay and is established by the President's Pay Agent for General Schedule employees in the 48 contiguous States and Washington, DC. The Pay Agent has established 32 GS locality pay areas, including the Rest of U.S. locality pay area.  PAYBANDING  A salary structure divided into fewer, broader pay ranges than traditional grades. Broad grades reduce the number of traditional grades, widen them, and generally retain traditional salary administration. Career bands are fewer and broader than broad grades and involve alternative salary administration. Also commonly called broadbanding. The positive movement of salary within a pay range. For example, pay progression is approximately 1% if salary increases by 4% while the pay range increases by 3%. An organization's policies for managing position-in-range are implemented through the pay system's pay progression method (e.g., the conditions an employee must meet to advance in the range or to be paid the top rates in a pay range).  PAY PROGRESSION  APRIL 2002  U.S. OFFICE  OF PERSONNEL  M  ANAGEMENT   74 PERFORMANCE  1. The act of going through or executing in the proper, customary, or established manner. 2. The manner in which or the efficiency with which something reacts or fulfills its intended purpose. NOTE: These two complementary, but distinct, definitions of performance reflect the fundamental evolution in conception that occurred throughout the public sector in the late years of the 20th century as expectations and accountability shifted from processes (definition 1) to results (definition 2). Further, the connotation of ""results"" has increasingly expanded to entail constant improvement. Given continually evolving technologies and expected improvements in human capital and financial management, performance goals typically describe increases in terms of results (e.g., customer satisfaction index targeted to improve from 85 to 90, unit cost decreased by 8 percent) rather than in terms of process.  PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT  In the context of employee performance, an integrated set of managerial processes that consists of: planning performance  both by translating organizational goals and objectives to specific results employees and units are expected to achieve and by establishing the measures that will be used to assess such achievement and maintain accountability, monitoring performance  through ongoing observation and feedback, including taking steps to address and resolve poor performance, developing the capacity to perform  both by increasing needed employee competencies through learning management and by improving business processes, appraising performance  including formally measuring and reporting individual, group, and organizational achievements and periodically summarizing performance in an employee's formal rating of record, and rewarding performance  both informally using ongoing recognition and formally using financial rewards such as variable pay based on organizational, group, or individual achievements and adjustments to individual rates of pay.

The position of a pay rate relative to all pay rates in a range. Position-in-range is normally expressed as a percentile, but may be expressed relative to control points or range zones. The increase of a General Schedule employee's pay from one step rate to the next higher rate for that same grade in advance of completion of the applicable waiting period. A range of pay rates, from minimum to maximum. A hierarchical structure of pay ranges. The salary structure may be expressed in terms of job grades, job-evaluation points, or policy lines. An organization may use different salary structures for different categories of employees. Derived from the statutory phrase ""series of classes,"" this term is synonymous with occupation for almost all purposes. Rates of basic pay that are higher than the normal GS rates. OPM may establish special rates for a group or category of GS positions in one or more geographic areas to address existing or likely significant handicaps in recruiting or retaining well-qualified employees. Special salary rates address staffing problems caused by pay disparities, undesirable working conditions, remoteness, or any other circumstance considered appropriate.

Strategic rewards refer to the bundle of all employee reward elements, including compensation, benefits, development and learning, and the work environment. Strategic rewards mix traditional with non-traditional rewards and make the employment relationship more meaningful and satisfying to the employee. An equal flat rate (dollars and cents) or percentage increase of the pay rates that define a pay structure, including pay range minimums, maximums, steps, and control points, if applicable. In non-Federal organizations, the increase is often not reflected in employee paychecks (see across-the-board increase). Non-Federal organizations often increase employee pay at approximately the same time as a structural adjustment, but use other mechanisms to do so, such as merit increases, which for most employees might closely track the adjustment in amount. In such circumstances, pay progression occurs to the extent employee increases exceed structural adjustments. Lump sum pay that is not guaranteed; variable pay is usually dependent on employee or organizational performance, or both.

Throughout this effort we have received assistance from many quarters. A number of State and city governments provided information about their pay systems. Federal agencies with established demonstration projects and with unique pay systems provided information freely. Agencies, Federal employee unions, and management and professional associations sent representatives to informal workgroups to hear about OPM's research and to offer observations about the wide range of compensation practices and issues we described. We want to make clear that the views expressed in this paper are those of OPM and not necessarily of any of the individuals or organizations who have helped us in our endeavor to understand the strengths and the challenges of the Federal white-collar pay system.

Agencies such as California Community Colleges, Council for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education, California Department of Commerce, Department of Rehabilitation, Department of Social Services, Employment Training Panel, and the State Department of Education have a vital role in the operation of the CCOIS. Should you have any questions regarding the information in this report, please contact Carol Viola, Golden Sierra Job Training Agency, at (530) 265-3201. Occupational Outlook Summaries The information included in the Occupational Outlook summaries is based on confidential surveys with employers within the Golden Sierra area (Alpine, El Dorado, Nevada, Placer, and Sierra Counties). The methods used to collect this information were designed and followed with the intention of collecting accurate and unbiased data. The occupations summarized in this publication are listed in alphabetical order on the Table of Contents page. If you are a first time user of this publication, please read the section in the appendix entitled Definitions and Terminology. Those who want a thorough understanding of the data and its strengths and limitations will also want to read the section on Program Methods. The information reported in the occupational summaries can be used by a variety of organizations and individuals for many different purposes.
