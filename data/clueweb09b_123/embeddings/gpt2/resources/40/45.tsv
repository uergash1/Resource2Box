The acupuncture needles used are usually hair-thin, and they are inserted into various points in the ear where they remain for about 20 minutes. For help in between sessions, many acupuncturists provide tiny balls (the size of the tip of a ball point pen), that are taped with invisible tape to the ear. When a craving for cigarettes hits, the smoker is instructed to press gently on the ball, which stimulates the acupuncture point.   A 2006 study analyzed 24 placebo-controlled trials on acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy, or electrostimulation for smoking cessation. There was no consistent evidence that these therapies were effective for smoking cessation. The researchers, however, concluded that further research was needed because the poor design of many of the studies made it difficult to draw a conclusion. One study involving 141 people found that acupuncture plus education on smoking cessation was four times as effective as acupuncture alone. The study also found that acupuncture plus education was twice as effective as sham acupuncture plus education.   For more information about acupuncture, read the  Acupuncture Fact Sheet .   2)  Lobelia The herb lobelia ( Lobelia inflata ) has been promoted to help people fight the effects of nicotine withdrawal and is found in many anti-smoking products. The active ingredient in lobelia, lobeline, is thought to have similar actions on the body as nicotine.  In 1993, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily prohibited the sale of certain lobelia products marketed to help people quit smoking. According to the report, the reason was because evidence showed they were not effective.   Later research has shown that lobeline may increase levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain similar to cigarettes. Dopamine influences mood and produces feelings of pleasure. There is still no evidence, however, showing that lobelia supplements help people quit smoking.  Lobelia is a potentially toxic herb, and should not be used unless under the supervision of a qualified health practitioner. It can cause dry mouth, profuse sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, rapid heartbeat, confusion, convulsions, coma, and in larger doses, even death.  People with heart disease, high blood pressure, heart disease, tobacco sensitivity, paralysis, seizure disorder, shortness of breath, or who are recovering from shock should not take this herb. Pregnant and nursing women and children should also not take lobelia. 3)  St. Johns wort  Although the herb St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )is used primarily for depression, there is some preliminary research on this herb to help people quit smoking. In one pilot study, 24 people who smoked 1 or more cigarettes a day received St. John's wort (450 mg capsule 2 times a day) plus smoking cessation counseling. After 12 weeks, 37.5% or 9 out of 24 people had quit.  Another pilot study found some effect, but the results were not long-term. Twenty-eight smokers were randomized to receive St. John's wort (300 mg once or twice a day), either once or twice daily for one week before quitting and continued for 3 months after. In addition, all participants received motivational/behavioural support. At 3 months, 18% continued to abstain from smoking. At a 12 month followup, it was 0%. Neither study was double-blind or placebo controlled, so they cannot be used as evidence. Although St. John's Wort appears to be reasonably safe when taken alone, it can interfere with the effectiveness of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, such as antidepressants, drugs to treat HIV infections and AIDs, drugs to prevent organ rejection for transplant patients, and oral contraceptives. St. John's wort is not recommended for pregnant or nursing women, children, or people with bipolar disorder, liver or kidney disease.

Dopamine is what makes people feel good after smoking and is part of the addiction process. Although intriguing, no studies to date have examined whether ginseng supplements can help people quit smoking. For more information about ginseng, read the  Ginseng Fact Sheet . 5)  Hypnotherapy  In 2000, a study by the Cochrane Collaboration analyzed nine longer-term studies on the use of hypnotherapy to quit smoking. The researchers found that hypnotherapy was not more effective on 6 month quit rates than other treatments or than no treatment.   Two subsequent studies had more promising results. In 2006, a pilot study examined the effect of hypnotherapy (one visit a week for 8 weeks) or no treatment (people were put on a waiting list). After the 8 weeks, 40% had abstained from smoking. At 12 months, 60% had abstained, and at 26 weeks, the abstinence rate was 4%.  In the second study, researchers looked at 12 hypnosis studies that reported the results by gender and found that the odds of achieving smoking abstinence were 1.37 times greater for male than female participants.

clueweb09-en0008-63-42215	"                          Home Topics Body Quit Smoking   Feel Better: Quit Smoking     "" Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics ."" letcher Knebel      Fletcher was right. Most smokers have at least one well-meaning soul lurking in the shadows (a suitable distance from that naughty secondhand smoke) who has in hand all the available National Cancer Institute statistics on lung cancer, emphysema, and the evils of tobacco. Pull out a lighter and he or she's all over you, informing you of the latest study proving that smoking leads to a whole bunch of things you already know.   It didn't work. You know all about lung cancer, nicotine, and additives. You also know about weight gain, irritability, cravings, and all those other lovely side effects of quitting. Funny how they rarely get mentioned in the statistics, huh?    Things You May or May Not Know   Someone probably told you what happens when you quit smoking, but did you know that the benefits begin almost immediately?                  Time Since Quitting      Health Changes that Take Place        20 minutes      Blood pressure and pulse rate return to normal.        8 hours      Nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in the blood are cut in half. Oxygen levels in the blood return to normal.        24 hours      Carbon monoxide is completely eliminated from the body. Lungs start to clear out the mucus and other debris of smoking.        48 hours      Nicotine is completely eliminated from the body. Your sense of taste and smell greatly improve.        72 hours      Breathing becomes easier. Energy levels increase. Bronchial tubes relax.        2-12 weeks      Circulation improves.        3-9 months      Lung function improves up to ten percent. Breathing problems (i.e. coughing and wheezing) are reduced.        1 year      Risk of heart attack falls by half.        10 years      Risk of lung cancer falls by half.        15 years      Risk of heart attack falls to the same level as someone who never smoked before.    The Difficulties of Quitting Smoking   Sure you'd like to quit, but so would a majority of other smokers. It's not as easy as it may seem, otherwise everyone would be quitting. Nicotine is addictive, and like any other drug, once it sinks its claws into you, getting them out is going to be an uphill battle.                  Withdrawal Symptom      Duration       Percent of Quitters Affected        Aggression/Irritability      Less than 4 weeks      50%        Craving      More than 2 weeks      70%        Depression      Less than 4 weeks      60%        Increased Appetite      More than 10 weeks      70%        Light-Headedness      Less than 48 hours      10%        Poor Concentration      Less than 2 weeks      60%        Restlessness      Less than 4 weeks      60%    Smokers seem to be in a lose-lose situation. If they continue to smoke, they're at higher risk for a number of lung and heart diseases. If they try to quit, they experience a series of withdrawal symptoms (which are extremely unpleasant) such as weight gain, poor concentration, depression, irritability, and nicotine cravings. And it's not that many smokers don't try to quit. The problem is that quitting is so difficult. Statistics show that only about 2.5 percent of smokers successfully quit each year.    If you truly want to stop smoking, you'll have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. You must believe that not smoking outweighs all the difficulties you will encounter, or you're not in the right frame of mind to stop. This is a tough decision, and if you're having trouble deciding, a few options can help.   What Are My Options for Quitting?   There's no foolproof way to stop smoking, but you knew that already. You'll probably have to experiment with several different techniques before you stumble across one that works for you.   Nicotine patches:  The patch has a fairly decent track recordbout twenty percent of people who use it have quit and remained smoke-free after six months. It has the convenience of being over-the-counter, but it's wise to consult a doctor before you start anyway, especially if you're pregnant. Possible side effects include skin rashes, nausea, headaches and stomach problems, and children should not come into contact with the patch at all. Most importantly, don't smoke while using the patch! Doing so can rocket your body's nicotine level up to toxic levels, which sort of defeats the purpose if you're quitting for health reasons!   Nicotine gum:  Like patches, nicotine gum is available over-the-counter. Some people prefer it to the patch because chewing gum provides the oral stimulation that also comes from smoking. The goal is to have quit by the end of six months, but some ex-smokers chew it for longer periods. The taste may turn off some people.   Medication:  Certain antidepressants curb nicotine cravings. Obviously, choosing to explore this route requires the involvement and consent of your doctor, who can explain the advantages and disadvantages of using medication to combat smoking.   Hypnosis:  One of the biggest advantages of hypnosis is its non-medicinal approacht can be combined with patches or medication without fear of unwanted physical side effects. It may prove to be what you need to quit, or it may give you enough of a push to let the more physical methods work.   Cold Turkey:  Ah, the macho way to quit! Just say no! Unfortunately, only about three percent of smokers who use this method succeed. Your chances of success rise if you have a good support group, however. Using a scheduled reduction plan, where you slowly reduce cigarette consumption, has also proven itself more effective than just quitting ""cold turkey.""   After You Quit Smoking   If it's not one thing, it's another. With smoking, you've either got the health problems of smoking or the withdrawal symptoms of quitting. If you've decided to quit smoking, good for you! Here's what you can look forward to.     Weight gain:  Smoking is an oral fixation. People who quit usually find something else to do with their restless mouth, such as eating. This can lead to weight gain (and water retention), but don't worry. The average weight gain is about 6 to 8 pounds, but don't let that weigh you down. A few trips to the gym and you'll be back to your smoking weight!   Cravings:  Nicotine is a drug. You're going to crave it for a long time (years). Try and find something to fight your cravingsike caffeine! Just kidding, try something like sugar-free gum, instead.   Other withdrawal symptoms:  The first week is most likely the worst. When the nicotine is completely eliminated from your system (about 2 to 3 days after your last cigarette), you're going to find out what ""a kick in the head"" feels like.     Will you ever feel better?  Let's just say you won't feel worsehat is unless you find breathing through a tracheostoma a step up.                                               Share your thoughts...

I smoked since I was 15. I have not had a cigarrete in almost 5 years. I don't want them anymore. Cravings are only fleeting almost nestalgic and only occure in any sense about 3 or 4 times per year. The entire habit can be removed from your life. Give this to yourself and your loved ones. You can do it!!!!!! Don't be the person pointing to your cigarette telling your kids, ""I don't want you kids to ever do this""                                                  Reply to  Scott                                       Report this Post                                                Name:                              Validate:              <- Type these numbers                     Email:                              Answer:                                                                                                                                                       Posted by  ByTor       November 22, 2008 at 05:45 PM                               Just wanted to say that whoever wants to quit can. Its easy...  I smoked from the age of 13 till 39 about 2 packs a day. I was always nervious about how ""hard"" it was going to be, and had heard that it was tougher then quiting heroin   : O   Long story short, I decided to focus on the gross feeling I sometimes got when I smoked (like the last drag of a smoke ya dident need, YUK!). For some reason that kind of green feeling/taste I just kept in my mind, and i thought of it every time I wanted a smoke. It was kinda like reinforcing in my mind that I hated smoking and that I definatly dident need them. Then, I usually started thinking of all the reasons I wanted to quit, and that I was a complete wimp if I couldent do it. I realized it was ALL in my mind. That, and it really wasent all that tough to not smoke. As a matter of fact it was easy when I related something bad (green feeling)with smoking rather then good. Trust me, I feel sooooooo much better now on so many levels that I cant begin to list them all here. Just know that in the end it\'s well worth it and it\'s really not that tough. ITS JUST ALL IN HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.  GOOD LUCK ALL. AND REMEMBER, ITS EASY.   :  )                                                     Reply to  ByTor                                       Report this Post                                                Name:                              Validate:              <- Type these numbers                     Email:                              Answer:                                                                                                                                                       Posted by  ton       October 05, 2008 at 09:02 AM                               wanted to stop smoking for a long long time. tried once but unfortunately was not successful because of the widrawal symptoms I experienced for 3 weeks.. want to try again tom.. hope this time I'll succeed..

CrossBow Bowflex and  Bandflex  are all similar type gyms that are often seen on TV. Like the   Weider  CrossBow Bowflex uses a rigid set of bars (which resist bending) to provide the resistance.                   At the time of writing this there are 4 models of the Bowflex:                                                             Ultimate                                                               Power Pro                                                               Motivator                                                               Versatrainer                                                         It is very similar to the Weider CrossBow in most ways. Particularly the types of exercises you can do. The major difference between the 2 besides the price is the orientation of the bending bars. On the Bowflex they are parallel to the lat tower but on the CrossBow they are perpendicular.                   The advantages of this gym is are its versatility and the weight. Since there are no weight plates and stacks, the gym is quite light.                   The major disadvantage of this gym is the price. The Bowflex is undoubtedly a fine piece of machinery but so are many other gyms that retail for a much lower price.                   Our choice as the leading alternative to this gym is the    Weider CrossBow   which retails at about half the price of the Bowflex.

Resistance training  is a form of  strength training  in which each effort is performed against a specific opposing  force . Exercises are  isotonic  if a body part is moving against the force. Exercises are  isometric  if a body part is holding still against the force. Resistance exercise is used to develop the  strength  and size of  skeletal muscles . Properly performed, resistance training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall  health  and well-being.

clueweb09-enwp00-21-19891	"                     Dieting          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Calibrated diet plate )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  may not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .              Measuring body weight on a  scale         Dieting  is the practice of  ingesting  food in a regulated fashion to achieve or maintain a controlled weight. In most cases the goal is  weight loss  in those who are  overweight  or  obese , but some athletes aspire to gain weight (usually in the form of  muscle ) and diets can also be used to maintain a stable body weight.

What works to reduce body weight for one person will not necessarily work for another, due to metabolic differences and lifestyle factors. Also, for a variety of reasons, most people find it difficult to maintain significant weight loss over time. Among individuals that have lost 10% or more of body weight, only 20% are able to maintain that weight loss for a full year. [ 1 ]       Athletes participating in  professional sports  may sometimes undertake weight-gain diets to increase their body mass and gain advantage in their field.       Individuals who are underweight, such as those recovering from  anorexia nervosa  or  starvation , may adopt weight-gain diets which, unlike those of athletes, have the goal of restoring normal levels of body fat, muscle, and stores of essential nutrients.       Actors, and people participating in similar activities, may pursue weight loss or gain in order to better portray a particular role.       [ edit ]   In children and young adults   Receiving adequate nutrition through a well-balanced diet is crucial during childhood and adolescence. Some diets can deprive the body of necessary nutrients, for instance  lipids . In addition, there are some indications that the harmful effects of starvation or extreme dieting during adolescence exceed the expected benefits, sometimes even leading to increased weight gains. [ 2 ]   Research shows that putting children on starvation or extreme diets can be harmful. The brain is unable to learn how to correlate taste with nutritional value, which is why such children may consistently overeat later in their life despite adequate nutritional intake.  [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Thermoregulation   As  endotherms , humans expend energy to maintain our blood temperature at  body temperature , which is approximately 37 C (98.6 F). This is accomplished by metabolism and blood circulation, by shivering to stay warm, and by sweating to stay cool. [ 4 ]   In addition to  thermoregulation , humans expend energy keeping the vital organs (especially the lungs, heart and brain) functioning. Except when sleeping, our  skeletal muscles  are working, typically to maintain upright posture. The average work done just to stay alive is the  basal metabolic rate .     [ edit ]   Physical exercise   Physical exercise  is an important complement to dieting in securing weight loss.  Aerobic exercise  is also an important part of maintaining normal  good health , especially the  muscular strength  of the heart.   Though the energy for muscle activity is primarily derived from the  glycogen  stored in the body, continued activity results in an increased use of the  fatty acids  as well. After the available glycogen stores are exhausted, fatty acids alone are used  [ 5 ] . It is often recommended that muscle activity be maintained for 20 minutes or more for increased usage of fatty acids.   The energy burnt during physical exercise has only a limited effect on weight loss, since an hour of aerobic exercise for a man in reasonable physical shape would burn about 2 megajoules (500 kilocalories), which is equivalent to only 60 grams (2 oz) of fat.   Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise would increase the  basal metabolic rate  (BMR) for some time after exercising. This leads to an additional caloric loss.     [ edit ]   Fat loss versus muscle loss   Weight loss typically involves the loss of fat, water and muscle.  Overweight  people, or people suffering from  obesity , typically aim to reduce the percentage of  body fat . Additionally, as muscle tissue is denser than fat, fat loss results in increased loss of body volume compared with muscle loss. To determine the proportion of weight loss that is due to decreased fat tissue, various methods of measuring  body fat percentage  have been developed.   Muscle loss during weight loss can be restricted by regularly lifting weights (or doing  push-ups  and other strength-oriented  calisthenics ) and by maintaining sufficient  protein  intake. Those on low-carbohydrate diets, and those doing particularly strenuous exercise, may wish to increase their protein intake. According to the  National Academy of Sciences , the  Dietary Reference Intake  for protein is ""0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight for adults.""   Excessive protein intake, may cause liver and kidney problems and may be a  risk factor  for  heart disease . [ 6 ] . There is no conclusive evidence that moderately high protein diets in healthy individuals are dangerous, it has only been shown that these diets are dangerous in individuals who already have kidney and liver problems.     [ edit ]   Energy obtained from food   The energy intake from food is limited by the efficiency of  digestion  and the efficiency of utilization. The efficiency of digestion is largely dependent on the type of food being eaten, while efficiency of utilization is affected by individual factors, including body weight and  hormones .   The effects of  chewing , especially in elderly people, have been shown to affect the intake of  micronutrients . However, there was no significant effect on the intake of  macronutrients , such as sugars, fats, and proteins [ 7 ] .     [ edit ]   Proper nutrition   Food provides nutrients from six broad classes:  proteins ,  fats ,  carbohydrates ,  vitamins ,  dietary minerals , and  water . Carbohydrates are metabolized to provide energy. Proteins provide  amino acids , which are required for cell, especially muscle, construction. Essential  fatty acids  are required for brain and cell membrane construction. Vitamins and trace minerals help maintain proper electrolyte balance and are required for many metabolic processes.  Dietary fiber  is another food component which influences health even though it is not actually absorbed into the body.   Any diet that fails to meet minimum nutritional requirements can threaten general health (and physical fitness in particular). If a person is not well enough to be active, weight loss and good quality of life will be unlikely.   The  National Academy of Sciences  and the  World Health Organization  publish guidelines for dietary intakes of all known essential nutrients.   Sometimes dieters will ingest excessive amounts of vitamin and mineral supplements. While this is usually harmless, some nutrients are dangerous. Men (and women who don't  menstruate ) need to be wary of  iron poisoning . Retinol (oil-soluble vitamin A) is toxic in large doses. As a general rule, most people can get the nutrition they need from foods. In any event, a multivitamin taken once a day will suffice for the majority of the population.   Weight-loss diets which manipulate the proportion of macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc.) have not been found to be more effective than diets which maintain a typical mix of foods with smaller portions and perhaps some substitutions (e.g. low-fat milk, or less salad dressing). [ 8 ]  Extreme diets may, in some cases, lead to malnutrition.     [ edit ]   The impact of meal frequency   An important but often overlooked factor in weight gain or loss -- in addition to the kinds of foods that are ingested -- is meal frequency. A number of studies on the subject have determined that eating more frequent, smaller meals or snacks during the day tends to lower total serum cholesterol levels, improve glucose tolerance, and mute weight gain. Tests conducted on groups participating in this eating approach, often termed grazing vs. gorging, show that spreading caloric intake throughout the day instead of compressing it into two or three meals has positive effects on general health as well as on achieving and maintaining ideal weight. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   How the body gets rid of fat   All body processes require energy to run properly. When the body is expending more energy than it is taking in (e.g. when exercising), the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, like complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source the body turns to is  glycogen  (by  glycogenolysis ). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, where 65% of it is stored in skeletal muscles and the rest in the liver (totaling about 2000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested  macronutrients , mainly carbohydrates. When those sources are nearly depleted, the body begins  lipolysis , the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or  fat cells , are broken down into  glycerol  and  fatty acids , which can be used to make energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.   Fats are also secreted by the  sebaceous glands  (in the skin).     [ edit ]   Psychological aspects of weight-loss dieting   Diets affect the ""energy in"" component of the energy balance by limiting or altering the distribution of foods. Techniques that affect the  appetite  can limit energy intake by affecting the desire to overeat.   Cognitive Behavior Therapy  has been effective in producing long term weight loss  [ 10 ] .  Judith S. Beck  has been one of the most prominent practitioners and writers to bring this method to a popular audience.   Consumption of low-energy, fiber-rich foods, such as non-starchy vegetables, is effective in obtaining satiation (the feeling of ""fullness""). Exercise is also useful in controlling appetite as is drinking water and sleeping.   The use of drugs to control appetite is also common. Stimulants are often taken as a means to suppress hunger in people who are dieting. Ephedrine (through facilitating the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline) stimulates the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor subtype, which is known to act as an  anorectic .  L-Phenylalanine , an amino acid found in whey protein powders also has the ability to suppress appetite by increasing the hormone  cholecystokinin  (CCK) which sends a satiety signal to the brain.     [ edit ]   Weight loss groups   There exist both profit-oriented and non-profit weight loss organizations who assist people in their weight loss efforts. An example of the former is  Weight Watchers ; examples of the latter include  Overeaters Anonymous , as well as a multitude of non-branded support groups run by local churches, hospitals, and like-minded individuals.   These organizations' customs and practices differ widely. Some groups are modelled on  twelve-step programs , while others are quite informal. Some groups advocate certain prepared foods or special menus, while others train dieters to make healthy choices from restaurant menus and while grocery-shopping and cooking.   Most groups leverage the power of group meetings to provide counseling, emotional support, problem-solving, and useful information.     [ edit ]   Food diary   A July 2008 study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, showed dieters who keep a daily food  diary  (or diet journal) of what they eat lose twice as much weight as those who do not. The researchers concluded, ""It seems that the simple act of writing down what you eat encourages people to consume fewer calories."" [ 11 ]  Diet journaling software and websites have become popular to help people track calorie consumption, calorie burning, weight loss goals, and nutritional balance.     [ edit ]   Medications   Certain medications can be prescribed to assist in weight loss. The most recent prescription weight loss medication released is Acomplia (generic name Rimonabant), manufactured by Sanofi Aventis. Used to treat obesity in persons with a BMI ( body mass index) of 30 or above as well as for smoking cessation treatments, Acomplia is still pending FDA approval for use in the United States. Other weight loss medications, like  amphetamines , are dangerous and are now banned for casual weight loss. Some supplements, including those containing  vitamins  and  minerals , may not be effective for losing weight.     [ edit ]   Diuretics   Diuretics  induce weight loss through the excretion of water. These medication or  herbs  will reduce the amount that a body weighs, but will have no effect on an individual's  body fat . Diuretics can thicken the blood, cause cramping, kidney and liver damage. There was even a report of a woman who died of swelling in her brain after she drank a large amount of water over a short period of time, while being on a special water diet. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Stimulants   Stimulants  such as  ephedrine  or  synephrine  work to increase the  basal metabolic rate  and reduce appetite.     [ edit ]   Dangers of fasting       Main article:  Fasting       Lengthy  fasting  can be dangerous due to the risk of  malnutrition  and should be carried out under medical supervision. During fasting or  very low calorie diets  the reduction of blood glucose, the preferred energy source of the  brain , causes the body to metabolize sugars from protein. Most experts believe that a prolonged fast can lead to muscle wasting although some dispute this.     [ edit ]   Side effects   Dieting, especially extreme food-intake reduction and rapid weight loss, can have the following side effects:     Prolonged hunger   Depression   Reduced sex drive   Fatigue   Irritability   Fainting   Sinus  problems (especially  post-nasal drip )   Muscle atrophy   Rashes   Acidosis   Bloodshot eyes   Gallbladder  disease   Seizures   Malnutrition , possibly leading to  death   Subsequent weight gain       [ edit ]   Low carbohydrate versus low fat       Main article:  Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets       Many studies have focused on diets that reduce calories via a low-carbohydrate ( Atkins diet ,  Scarsdale diet ,  Zone diet ) diet versus a low-fat diet ( LEARN diet ,  Ornish diet ). The  Nurses' Health Study , an observational  cohort study , found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less  coronary heart disease . [ 13 ]   A  meta-analysis  of  randomized controlled trials  by the international  Cochrane Collaboration  in 2002 concluded [ 14 ]  that fat-restricted diets are no better than calorie restricted diets in achieving long term weight loss in overweight or obese people. A more recent  meta-analysis  that included  randomized controlled trials  published after the Cochrane review [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ]  found that ""low-carbohydrate, non-energy-restricted diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. However, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to induce weight loss are considered."" [ 18 ]   The  Women's Health Initiative  Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial [ 19 ]  found that a diet of total fat to 20% of energy and increasing consumption of vegetables and fruit to at least 5 servings daily and grains to at least 6 servings daily resulted in:     no reduction in cardiovascular disease [ 20 ]   an insignificant reduction in invasive breast cancer [ 21 ]   no reductions in colorectal cancer [ 22 ]     Additional recent  randomized controlled trials  have found that:     A comparison of Atkins,  Zone diet ,  Ornish diet , and  LEARN diet  in  premenopausal women  found the greatest benefit from the  Atkins diet . [ 23 ]       The choice of diet for a specific person may be influenced by measuring the individual's insulin secretion:       In  young adults  ""Reducing glycemic [carbohydrate] load may be especially important to achieve weight loss among individuals with high insulin secretion."" [ 24 ]  This is consistent with prior studies of diabetic patients in which low carbohydrate diets were more beneficial. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]     The  American Diabetes Association  released for the first time a recommendation (in its January 2008 Clinical Practice Recommendations) for a low carbohydrate diet to reduce weight for those with or at risk of Type 2 diabetes. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Low glycemic index   ""The  glycemic index  factor is a ranking of foods based on their overall effect on blood sugar levels. Low glycemic index foods, such as lentils, provide a slower more consistent source of glucose to the bloodstream, thereby stimulating less insulin release than high glycaemic index foods, such as white bread."" [ 28 ] [ 29 ]   The glycemic load is ""the mathematical product of the glycemic index and the carbohydrate amount"". [ 30 ]   In a  randomized controlled trial  that compared four diets that varied in carbohydrate amount and glycemic index found complicated results [ 31 ] :     Diet 1 and 2 were high carbohydrate (55% of total energy intake)    Diet 1 was high-glycemic index   Diet 2 was low-glycemic index       Diet 3 and 4 were high protein (25% of total energy intake)    Diet 3 was high-glycemic index   Diet 4 was low-glycemic index         Diets 2 and 3 lost the most weight and fat mass; however, low density lipoprotein fell in Diet 2 and rose in Diet 3. Thus the authors concluded that the high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index diet was the most favorable.   A  meta-analysis  by the  Cochrane Collaboration  concluded that low glycemic index or low glycemic load diets led to more weight loss and better lipid profiles.  However , the  Cochrane Collaboration  grouped low glycemic index and low glycemic load diets together and did not try to separate the effects of the load versus the index.

The study also showed that as the stride is lengthened, more calories are burned without any higher rate of perceived exertion by the user. This study lends credibility to the claims made about the adjustable stride length feature on some newer ellipticals. ==========================================    Aero Beds- Air Beds & Mattresses   *****  AmeriBag- Healthy Back Bags  *****  Back Support, Back Rests & Seat Cushions  *****  Bedding, Pillows, Silk Sheets, More  *****  Body Pillows & Bed Wedge Supports   *****  Fitness Exercise Equipment & Home Gyms  *****  Inversion Tables  *****  KneelingChairs & Computer Chairs  *****  Lafuma Recliners & Lafuma Chairs  *****  LaptopTables & Office Computer Desks  *****  Massagers & Massage Tools  *****  Massage Chairs & Massage Loungers   *****  Portable Massage Tables  *****  Meditation & Relaxation Products  *****  Obus FormeBack Care Products  *****  Office Chairs & Desk Chairs  *****  Outdoor Chairs & Ergonomic Comfort  *****  Zero Gravity Chairs  I*****  More Comfort Products  *****  Clearance & Special Sales   ==================================================== An elliptical trainer (aka cross trainer, elliptical, crosstraining machine) is a stationary exercise machine used to simulate walking or running while reducing excessive pressure to the joints, and the risk of impact injuries. (User does not take feet off of pedals)  Elliptical trainers offer a non-impact cardiovascular workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on the resistance preference. Most elliptical trainers work the user's upper and lower body (please note some models do not have moving upper body components).   sales@sitincomfort-store.com       All contents copyright 1994-2008.

The primary reasons I like the Nordictrack ACT are the adjustable stride          length from 18-22"", the built-in iFit workout routines with digital          eddy current resistance and the small size of this unit compared to bulky          rear drive elliptical machines.         I think they could have done without the built-in games on the console,          and it would be nice to get a wireless heart rate control, but for the          price they're selling these units I'm willing to give on these two points...

It is primarily sold through the use of  infomercials .           Contents       1   Design and History   2   2004 recall   3   2006 new model introduced   4   Bowflex Home Gym Models   5   See also   6   References   7   External links               [ edit ]   Design and History   The Bowflex grew out of a now expired patent first conceived by an  Ethiopian  engineering student in San Francisco, Tessema Dosho Shifferaw. Bowflex of America, Inc. began marketing the first product, The Bowflex 2000X in 1986. Bowflex of America changed its name to Bowflex, Inc, and became a public company on the  Toronto Stock Exchange . In 1999 the company changed its name to Direct Focus, Inc. and initiated an IPO on  Nasdaq . With the success of Bowflex, the company bought the  Nautilus Corporation ,  Schwinn Fitness , and  Stairmaster Fitness . In 2002 the company moved to the  NYSE  and renamed itself The Nautilus Group and is now  Nautilus, Inc.  which owns and markets the Bowflex along with Nautilus, Schwinn Excersise, Stairmaster and  Pearl Izumi  lines among other brands. [ citation needed ]   Instead of conventional  weights  or  pulley  machines, the original Bowflex machine used a combination of polymer rods to create constant resistance or tension. The machines are marketed as taking up much less space than a complete set of weights and machines. The company held a  patent  ( U.S. Patent 4,620,704   ) on this ""power rod"" design which expired in April 2004.  [1]   [2]     [ edit ]   2004 recall   In January 2004, about 420,000 Bowflex machines were  recalled  due to mechanical problems. In November 2004, there was a recall of nearly 800,000 (680,000 Power Pro units and 102,000 Ultimate units) Bowflex machines after reports that several models had broken unexpectedly. The  Consumer Product Safety Commission  said that the seats could unexpectedly break, and that the backboard bench could collapse when in the incline position on the Power Pro model. This recall was voluntary and the company offered every purchaser a free safety repair kit. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   2006 new model introduced   In 2006, Nautilus released the Bowflex Revolution with a completely new design and new resistance technology. The new model uses circular plates containing coiled straps around a  cam  which can interlock in place of the polymer rods. Nautilus claims that the new system makes the machine easier to use than its predecessor. It has more adjustments to accommodate different sized users and provides a larger variety of exercise variations.

It is    also common to find that elliptical trainers are most enjoyed by people    because they tend to be the most fun to use, and at the same time, give    you one of the best results for your efforts. The term 'elliptical' is    actually a shorter term for 'elliptical motion', which is a commonly    used term in physical fitness reviews, as well as other fitness exercise    journals. An elliptical motion refers to a physical motion that is    repeated in the same pattern, which simulates activities that are    natural or instinctive to the body, such as walking, running, rowing or    climbing stairs. By having the body repeat this same motion over and    over again, the elliptical trainer is able to train isolated muscles,    thereby building stamina and helping you develop specified areas of your    body. Those who have used  elliptical equipment  constantly, find    that these trainers are very effective in helping you achieve your    desired heart rate while exercising. This is mainly because the repeated    actions involved in using elliptical trainers, help to gradually bring    your body's cardiovascular rate up comfortably. This is very different    from exercises such as jogging, whereby your heart rate is immediately    pushed to its peak performance. Also, activities such as running or    jogging put a lot of strain and pressure on your bones and joints, which    is why the repetitive motions that elliptical trainers utilise, are a    good low impact alternative to these high impact activities. For those    who are looking for a full body workout without having to go to the gym,    you will be surprised to know that this is also possible with elliptical    cross trainers. These trainers are specially designed to help you train    and strengthen every major part of your body. Being able to have this    fully body workout also helps you burn calories at a faster rate, as you    are doing more high performance exercises. Once again, the repetitive    motions of elliptical trainers help you to minimise the wear and tear    that your bones might experience with high impact sports, which is why    elliptical trainers are a very good long-term option, as it minimises    unnecessary pressure on your body. To get an even better idea on the    benefits of elliptical trainers, you should pick up some magazines that    might contain reviews and more detailed information on    elliptical equipment .                                                                                                              Home          Buy Elliptical Machine              Elliptical           Trainer             Elliptical           Machine             Elliptical           Exercise                         Elliptical Equipment                       Elliptical Cross Trainer            Copyright (c) www.buyellipticalsbynet.com

Contents       1   Design and History   2   2004 recall   3   2006 new model introduced   4   Bowflex Home Gym Models   5   See also   6   References   7   External links               [ edit ]   Design and History   The Bowflex grew out of a now expired patent first conceived by an  Ethiopian  engineering student in San Francisco, Tessema Dosho Shifferaw. Bowflex of America, Inc. began marketing the first product, The Bowflex 2000X in 1986. Bowflex of America changed its name to Bowflex, Inc, and became a public company on the  Toronto Stock Exchange . In 1999 the company changed its name to Direct Focus, Inc. and initiated an IPO on  Nasdaq . With the success of Bowflex, the company bought the  Nautilus Corporation ,  Schwinn Fitness , and  Stairmaster Fitness . In 2002 the company moved to the  NYSE  and renamed itself The Nautilus Group and is now  Nautilus, Inc.  which owns and markets the Bowflex along with Nautilus, Schwinn Excersise, Stairmaster and  Pearl Izumi  lines among other brands. [ citation needed ]   Instead of conventional  weights  or  pulley  machines, the original Bowflex machine used a combination of polymer rods to create constant resistance or tension. The machines are marketed as taking up much less space than a complete set of weights and machines. The company held a  patent  ( U.S. Patent 4,620,704   ) on this ""power rod"" design which expired in April 2004.  [1]   [2]     [ edit ]   2004 recall   In January 2004, about 420,000 Bowflex machines were  recalled  due to mechanical problems. In November 2004, there was a recall of nearly 800,000 (680,000 Power Pro units and 102,000 Ultimate units) Bowflex machines after reports that several models had broken unexpectedly. The  Consumer Product Safety Commission  said that the seats could unexpectedly break, and that the backboard bench could collapse when in the incline position on the Power Pro model. This recall was voluntary and the company offered every purchaser a free safety repair kit. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   2006 new model introduced   In 2006, Nautilus released the Bowflex Revolution with a completely new design and new resistance technology. The new model uses circular plates containing coiled straps around a  cam  which can interlock in place of the polymer rods. Nautilus claims that the new system makes the machine easier to use than its predecessor. It has more adjustments to accommodate different sized users and provides a larger variety of exercise variations.

Abdominal exercise equipment                   Imagine a person with a thin frame but layers of fat around his waist. A lot of people get into this ugly shape because of their work routines and sedentary lifestyles which require them to sit for long hours. Such a lifestyle does nt burn up the required calories, the metabolism rate gets low and the fat in the body starts to grow especially in the abdominal area. Most of the middle aged men suffer from a fat belly. Getting  abdominal exercise equipment  is a good idea for your fitness goals.   There is no single way to reduce fat in the abdominal area. You have to start with some basic exercises and combine them together for effective fat loss. Start with cardiovascular or aerobic exercises to increase your metabolism, a lot of  fitness equipment  like treadmills and elliptical trainers are available for your cardio workouts.  Elliptical vs treadmills   can help you choose whats best for you. There are numerous  benefits of cardiovascular fitness   itself, second would be getting into some form of weight training which strengthens your muscles and bring some strength and shape to your body. Third part would be working up your abdominal muscles and toning them. A combination of all this will get you in shape faster than anything else and reduce that extra fat in your body   There is a number of abdominal exercise equipment available in the markets which claim to reduce the extra fat around the waist but how many of them really work. The truth is that there is no short cut to a fit body, if you want to be fit and lean, looking good in what ever you wear you have to work it out. Now out of the abdominal exercise equipment what works the best or which is the best ab exercise machine and is most effective.   The most common of the abdominal fitness equipment is the ab exercise bench or ab bench which can be put on an incline or decline. This is the most basic and one of the most effective ab equipment you can use. The thing to remember is to target your ab muscles and not strain your back or shoulders.   Other ab exercise equipment would be an exercise ball. This can be used very effectively while working on your abdominals doing crunches. The only thing to keep in mind is that you can go off balance if you dont use the right technique, so go slow and use the right muscles.     Other common abdominal fitness equipment would be roman chair. This has parallel arms with a padded straight and high back. It does require a little bit of strength in fore arms to use roman chair. And people who do not have enough strength in their arms or are overweight may not be able to use it the way its supposed to.   Apart from all these there are so many other abdominal exercise equipment available. Some made popular by TV commercials claiming to reduce your belly fat. Most of them dont work as expected and then get you demotivated. The rule is that equipment should be able to isolate your ab muscles so that you can get them to work easily. Everything else would strain your back or shoulders and would be ineffective. So get on to your fitness routine and work those abdominals for a great shape.                  April 30th, 2008   | Posted in  Gym  |    No Comments                                        Nordic track elliptical trainers reviews                   Nordic track is a quite a well known brand in  fitness equipment  industry.  Nordic track treadmills   are have a good range and are popular among fitness enthusiasts. Treadmills are good for indoor cardio exercises but elliptical trainers are catching up to them in terms of good cardiovascular machines. You can read about  elliptical Vs treadmills  in a previous article.   Elliptical trainers can give you a good cardiovascular workout. Usually they acquire up about as much space as a treadmill and are a safer workout than treadmills. There is an added advantage of an elliptical workout that you can use your upper body along with your lower body movements which is good for an overall exercise.   So how good are Nordic track elliptical trainer reviews .  There are a number of models of Nordic Track elliptical trainers to choose from according to your budget and fitness goals.     The  Nordic Track elliptical  is a heavy unit and by comparable standards with other ellipticals, not very solidly constructed. A few models of Nordic Track elliptical trainers are the Ellipse, the Space Saver (fold up), the Ramp series also known as Auto Strider series and the A series(ASR 700 and ASR 1000). Unlike other brands of cross-trainers or elliptical exercise machines, Nordic Track ellipticals are affordable. A good feature is the adjustability of some of their settings. The resistance and incline of the trainer can be adjusted for a more challenging workout for your requirement which help you loose more weight effectively. Space saver elliptical has a unique design which folds up neatly if you have space constraints which makes it a popular choice.   The NordicTrack elliptical machines are built with a long stride with a variety of resistant settings able of adapting to any user’s needs. With long strides, most users can use the machine effectively as it targets more muscle groups. But for some short people a long stride may not be comfortable. Most NordicTrack elliptical machines come with an LCD screen, you can download programs and fit it straight to your machine for an extra workout. Other than these models there is Nordic track commercial series elliptical (1300 and A.C.T.)available for commercial or heavy duty use in clubs and gyms.   A Nordic track elliptical can be a good choice for your exercise regime. Just decide on the model you want to buy and get on to some exiting and healthy lifestyle.                  April 21st, 2008   | Posted in  Ellipticals ,   Nordic track  |    2 Comments                                               New Balance 8000 elliptical trainer                   New Balance 8000 elliptical trainer is a product of New Balance which is a company better known for shoes and fitness apparels, they are also in the marketing of elliptical trainers and exercise bikes. New Balance elliptical trainers have been around for some years and people like them for their exercise trainings. The company’s fitness equipment is made in  China  and  Taiwan  is marketed through Fitness Quest of Canton Ohio, which also markets other brands like Ab Lounge, Edge and Total Gym. So a person looking forward to an elliptical trainer would be a little skeptical about buying equipment from a company which specializes in shoes and apparels.     New Balance elliptical machines are made with both front and mid drive designs. This is the  New Balance 8000 elliptical trainer review  as it   is one of their new products that are available with a centre drive. Foot pedals are wide enough for anyone who wants to use the machine. The stride length can also be adjusted from 18 to 20 inches to match the strides of a tall person and a person with medium height. Usually the taller the user longer will be his natural stride. So this machine can be used comfortably by many people with varying requirements. At a weight of 180 lbs, the elliptical machine is quite stable during the workouts; the user weight it can handle is 300 lbs. Noise levels during the workout is average and comparable to other elliptical trainers. There are 16 resistance levels to choose from and the resistance comes from magnetic brakes.   Warranty for New balance 8000 elliptical trainer is Frame - 10 Years; Electronics - 2 Years; Parts - 1 Year. At this price its a machine which does its job well. If you are looking for some thing more you have other options to look for. There are elliptical trainers available to suit every requirement, if you are looking a good machine in terms of your budget or the effectiveness of your workouts. As in buying any other  home gym exercise equipment , keep in mind your exercise goals before you come to a decision. For serious workouts you have to pay out more to get equipment that will take an extra handling and last for years to come.                  April 18th, 2008   | Posted in  Ellipticals  |    No Comments                                        Schwinn 418 elliptical trainer                   Schwinn is part of the Nautilus Health and Fitness Group, and this brand includes equipment like elliptical trainers, stationary exercise bicycles, indoor cycling, treadmills,  home gyms , and much more. The company promotes a lot of bicycle competitions. Schwinn ellipticals are aimed primarily at home rather than commercial use, but are aimed at every level. The Schwinn 418 is a basic low-end front drive elliptical machine. The  Schwinn 418 elliptical trainer  is one of the more popular elliptical trainers on the market. The elliptical trainer is quite steady and sturdy. It is more of a stationary elliptical machine and chances are, you will not be transporting this elliptical from room to room though it does come with transportation wheels.             The Schwinn 418 elliptical trainer uses an over sized fly wheel at the front of the elliptical. The machine also uses an articulating footplate for added comfort. Basically, it means the footplate adjusts according to the motion of movement to provide ankle relief and support The Schwinn 418 elliptical trainer uses the eddy current brake system which is possibly the quietest and smoothest resistance system on the elliptical market today.. The elliptical stride is more than enough to accommodate most of the users in your home with its lengthened 18 inch/46 centimeter stride.   The Schwinn 418 elliptical trainers 12 programmes include rolling, valley, fat burn, ramp, random, plateau, intervals, mountain, 2 heart-rate, 1 fitness test, & manual mode.. The LCD console is not backlit and there are only 8 levels of resistancenot enough to provide workout variety. Maximum user weight is 275 pounds. Warranty is 15 year frame, 2 years parts, 1 year electronics and 6 months labor. Warranties could be better as people expect their machine to last for a few years. The single wheel design is more likely to wear out, where the pedals are attached to a bar that rolls back and forth on a rail. But if you want a high quality elliptical trainer, you have other choices in the market.   The Schwinn elliptical trainers are not your health club machines like  Precor   and  Life Fitness . They are a moderately priced and ideal for those who want the convenience of working out at home, but have a limited budget. So it is primarily your fitness goals and the budget that decides which equipment you should buy.                  March 28th, 2008   | Posted in  Ellipticals  |    No Comments                                        Best exercise machine- Elliptical vs Treadmill                   Most of us know about elliptical trainers now, they are gaining popularity fast as the best cardio workout machines. Exercise machines with big handles also known as cross trainers. They are also effective in giving you a good workout for your  cardiovascular fitness  just like treadmills. Looking for the best fitness machine, when we compare  elliptical Vs treadmills , elliptical trainers have some advantage over treadmills in the sense that they give you a upper body workout as well. Your feet do not lift from the footpads so there is no impact on your feet, knees and joints as you move in an elliptical motion. Although the treadmill belt is better for your knees than the ground, there is still a significant amount of impact on your joints. A lot of people switch over to elliptical machines for this reason alone.      Now the question in analyzing elliptical Vs treadmills is that, which one burn more calories?   If you are looking for a quality cardiovascular workout with the maximum efficiency, Elliptical cross trainer could be your best choice.   Elliptical trainers give you a more thorough workout as there is an involvement of upper body movement as well. Because elliptical trainers also work the upper and lower body simultaneously, the heart rate climbs more quickly. Thus, less time is required to achieve more results. With  treadmill exercises   also,   the ideal workout would be using arms to make a natural walking or jogging motion but most of us do not follow this and our upper body movement is almost negligible. That makes a difference in calorie burn out. Studies suggest that exercising numerous muscle groups increases fat burning efficiency.   If your joints are suffering from strain or just old age, and if you would like to exercise your upper body, the elliptical trainer is a good choice.   With ellipticals you can add versatility to your workouts as the foot pedals can be worked in a forward or reverse direction. When you change the direction of the pedals, you’ll target your lower body in different ways. The intensity level can be adjusted on elliptical equipment according to your fitness levels. Resistance may be added as desired to increase the workload on your legs throughout the forward or backward stride. With all this added to your workout, you dont do the same thing everyday and get bored out of it.   In elliptical Vs treadmill comparison, with respect to burning calories, an elliptical gives you the same results as running on a treadmill, but you burn fewer calories if you walk or jog on a treadmill. So it depends on what kind of exercise are you doing on a treadmill. Walking or jogging does not burn many calories. And if you like to go light with your treadmill workouts you will find elliptical much more effective and more  calories burned on an elliptical trainer   However if you like to walk or run, nothing beats a good treadmill.                  March 27th, 2008   | Posted in  Ellipticals ,   Treadmills  |    2 Comments                                        Precor 9.33 treadmill                   Precor treadmills  offer one of the best workout experiences on a treadmill.

But at the same time it is assembled with highly durable parts and therefore the quality is good.                  The  Precor 9.33 Treadmill  has some beneficial upgrades over the Precor 9.31. 9.33 has a great design with a powerful 3.0 CHP motor, speeds ranging from 0.5 to 12 mph (0.8-20 km/h).

CR rated the Precor 9.33 as “Excellent” for quality, exercise range and ergonomics. Precor offers a very generous 10 year parts and wear items warranty with one year labor and a Lifetime warranty on frame.

Life fitness treadmills  have some good option in the premium segment.

Elliptical Trainers for $800-$1500    Finding a trainer in this range that can be a quality piece of workout equipment can be very difficult.  Most of the higher quality elliptical trainers will cost in excess of $1500, but there are some really good models in this price range if you know what to look for.   The first feature to consider is step distance. Many trainers in this price range offer a very small step distance.  This means a much poorer workout for you.  Look to see if you can find a machine with the step distance you require to complete a solid workout.     Most of the elliptical trainers in this price range offer some advanced features like pulse trackers, varied programs, and self programmable routines.  Do                   not expect much, as was stated earlier when shopping in this price range the most important thing is that you get a machine that can stand up to your workout.   Shopping in the $1500-$3000 Price Range   Here is where some of the machines start to get much more advanced features.  Workout machines in this price range are starting to push towards the very expensive, so the first thing to consider when looking in this range is what kind of warranty, service, and support comes with your elliptical trainer.     Make sure that the trainer has at least a two year warranty.  Also, you should be able to find most if not all of the features that you are looking for, so be sure to double check that the trainer comes with everything you need before you buy.   Shopping in the $3000+ Range   Here is where you get the truly gym class elliptical trainers.  For most people, spending this much money on a trainer is not a good idea because these are designed for everyday 7-20 hour a day use.  For a normal home user that is just not practical.     In addition, most, if not all, of the features available on units in this price range are available on trainers in the lower cost bracket.  You would probably do better to simply find a trainer in that price range that has all the features you need.

But you don't necessarily            need to be a professional body builder and compete in order to do body            building. Many people practice this sport to change their physique and            improve their health.                        So do you want a more muscular body? Whether you're skinny or fat, body            building can help you achieve your goals that is to have the body of            your dreams. For skinny people, body building will help you bulk up            and get a massive and ripped body. For fat or obese people, body building            will help you tone your muscles and along with cardio exercises, you            will get rid of your fat and get a leaner and muscular physique. Body            building not only helps you physically but mentally as well because            it builds self-confidence, makes you more disciplined and helps you            achieve your goals in life.

E35 Sole Elliptical Trainers  smoothly add new members to the Sole Fitness Elliptical fan club. This Sole Elliptical Machine doesn't bring any warranty woes with it, as there is lifetime coverage on the frame and a 5 year warranty on Sole Elliptical parts and labor. The Sole E35 Elliptical Trainer, mostly purchased from Dick's Sporting Goods Store, has a whisper quiet action, and the comfortable stride length seen in all Sole Fitness Elliptical Trainers.    E35 Sole Elliptical Trainer Mechanics:  The ultra smooth, quiet drive system allows for both a forward and reverse mode. This is an important aspect not seen in all elliptical trainers. It has the advantage of bringing different muscle groups into play for greater muscle fitness efficiency. The heavy 30 lb flywheel and the high gear ratio are also not often seen in machines in this price range. You will experience the benefit in increased resistance that will challenge all your leg muscles during a workout. The Sole E35 Elliptical comes with 16 adjustable resistance levels.    E35 Sole Elliptical Trainer Console:  This elliptical machine sports a user-friendly console with a blue backlight LCD display.    Sole E35 Elliptical Trainer Comfort Zone:  The built-in cooling fans treat you to a soft breeze during your workout, while the bottle holder takes care of your thirsty throat. The oversized foot pedals of the Sole Elliptical ensures a comfortable training period. These pedals come with an innovative 2 degree inward slope, designed to further reduce ankle and knee stress problems, thus minimizing injuries. Four rear wheels on the E35 Elliptical Sole help to stabilize the machine.    E35 Sole Elliptical Trainer's Cross Training:  The Sole E35 also sports a set of handlebars which facilitate an upper body workout while you are targeting your lower body.    Sole E35 Elliptical Trainer Sensors:  Hand grip pulse sensors feature on the handle bars. A chest strap is also included.    E35 Sole Elliptical Trainer Stride:  The comfortable stride length of 20"" should suit most users.    Sole E35 Elliptical Trainer Workouts:  The Sole E35 features 8 built-in programs, and 1 custom program to be used for personal goal setting.    E35 Sole Elliptical Trainer Weight:  The Sole Elliptical E35 is sturdy enough to deal with user weights of up to 300 lbs.    Sole E 35 Elliptical Trainer Warranty:  One of the trademarks of Sole Fitness Equipment is the extensive warranties the company offer. Sole E35 reviews mention that this machine comes with a lifetime warranty on the frame, Sole Elliptical parts and electronics coverage for five years, as well as a labor warranty of 2 years. When you look at a range such as the  Proform Treadmills , the skimpy warranties compared to those of the  Sole Treadmill  for example, are the source of major complaints. Sole clearly trusts its products and know that the components are of a high quality.   The basic model in the Sole Elliptical range is the  Sole E25 Elliptical Trainer . Other models include the Sole E55 Elliptical Trainer, and the flagship Sole E95 Elliptical Trainer. In the past, the Sole E89 Elliptical Trainer also proved to be a popular machine.   Other Sole products stocked by  Dick's Sporting Goods Store , are the folding  Sole Treadmills , featuring models such as the  Sole F63 Treadmill , the Sole F80 Treadmill, Sole F83 Treadmills, and the Sole F85 Treadmill.    Sole Elliptical reviews  are mostly favorable. If you are looking for a low-impact exercise option that is reliable and robust, with the reassurance of a lengthy warranty, the Sole E35 Elliptical Trainer has all this in its package.

Our  review of Smooth elliptical trainers  comes in two forms, the Smooth CE and the Smooth ME elliptical exercise machines. Before we talk about the specific features of the Smooth ME, here is a quick overview of why Smooth elliptical trainers are regarded so highly in the marketplace.      (1) Smooth elliptical trainers have a 3 to 1 lower to upper body resistance ratio. Since this is typically proportional to weight composition of the human body, the result is a more intense and efficient workout.      (2) In our review of smooth elliptical trainers, we found that this company uses components and applies construction methods that are comparable to industry leaders in terms of quality. However, as you will soon realize, Smooth elliptical trainers are much more affordable than many of these competitors. This is partially the result of selling online directly and eliminating the cost of retail sales.      (3) Their warranties are valid in the US and Canada. In our review of smooth elliptical trainers, we also found that they operate with a 30 day money back guarantee policy on all their products.     Smooth ME Elliptical trainer:   The ME is the base model that is usually around $899.00.      Editor's note:  Please read our  Smooth ME elliptical review s for detailed information about this product.      Smooth CE Elliptical trainer:     The CE elliptical trainer ranges from $1399 to $1999 depending on what time of the year you purchase the equipment.      Editor's note:  Please read our  Smooth CE elliptical revie ws  for detailed information about this product.                                                                                                                          Where to buy Smooth Elliptical Trainers               Smooth Fitness       This is the only one place online to purchase Smooth elliptical trainers. The Smooth fitness store currently carries both its CE and ME elliptical trainers. In early 2004, they plans to release a few additional ellipticals.

(December 2008)              Commercial Elliptical Trainer (rear drive version)       An  elliptical trainer  (also  cross trainer  or simply  elliptical ) is a stationary  exercise machine  used to simulate  walking  or  running  without causing excessive pressure to the joints, hence decreasing the risk of impact injuries.   Elliptical trainers offer a non-impact  cardiovascular  workout that can vary from light to high intensity based on the resistance preference set by the user.           Contents       1   History   2   Overview   3   Motor fitness   4   Usage instructions   5   See also   6   References   7   External links               [ edit ]   History   Elliptical trainers are relatively new additions to cardiovascular fitness equipment.     [ edit ]   Overview   Most elliptical trainers work the user's upper and lower body (although some models do not have moving upper body components). An elliptical trainer is designed to provide a cardiovascular workout rather than build muscles. Though elliptical trainers are considered to be minimal-impact, they are an example of a weight-bearing form of exercise. [ 1 ]  They can be self-powered by user-generated motion or need to be plugged in for adjustment of motion and/or for supplying their electronic consoles and resistance systems.   There are three types of elliptical trainers, categorized by the motor or ""drive"" location. The oldest elliptical design is the ""rear drive"" type from manufacturers such as Life Fitness and Precor. The ""front-drive"" elliptical was the second generation design by manufacturers such as Octane Fitness. The latest design technology is the ""center-drive"" by manufacturers such as Quantum Fitness.   On some models, the incline of sloping roller ramps beneath the pedal-links can be adjusted to produce varying pedal motion paths. The result of such adjustment changes the burdens on various  muscle  groups in the legs. Some  mechatronic  models can vary both the incline, resistance and stride length over the course of a workout according to a preset program. Some trainers can be driven in a reverse as well as in a forward direction. Elliptical trainers are primarily driven via the legs, and most are combination designs having handle-levers attached to each pedal-link for the purpose of enabling a burden on the arms to provide a secondary source of driving power. The user grips the handles below shoulder height and pushes/pulls them while shuffling the feet back and forth within their elliptically shaped paths. Thus the oscillating handle motions are dependently coordinated with the constrained pedal motions. Poorly designed machines are too dependent on the user's leg power, producing excessive handle speeds as a result of mechanical ratios that do not provide enough advantage to the handle-levers. Consequently such machines feel to the user as if his or her arms are simply going along for the ride, rather than sharing in the work. The better models offer a harmonious combination of arm and leg exercise in the correct ratios.   Some manufacturers produce commercial models, which focus on durability and are made to withstand the more frequent use of the fitness club environment. These units typically sell for well over $4,000 (US), offering greater durability and programming than the typical home user would ever need. There are also models available for use in one's home. These can be purchased at a more reasonable price, with some machines starting at under $500 (US).   An elliptical cross trainer is comparable to a  treadmill  in its exertion of leg muscles and the heart. Ellipticals produce an intermediate range of leg motion between that of  stationary bikes  and treadmills.   There are claims that the dual action exercise of an elliptical trainer can actually be more efficient in burning calories. The logic is that by exercising more muscle groups simultaneously, a more intense workout can be achieved in less time. It is also suggested that the perceived rate of exertion is lower. However, other studies have shown that the rate in which calories are burned on an elliptical trainer is similar to that on a treadmill. [ 2 ]  Thomas Altena, a professor of nutritional and exercise physiologist of the University of Missouri-Columbia measured oxygen retention, lactic acid build-up, heart rate, and perceived rate of exertion to compare treadmills and elliptical trainers. [ 3 ]  According to Altena, the ""physiological responses associated with elliptical exercise were nearly identical to treadmill exercise"". [ 3 ]   Regardless, elliptical trainers are growing in popularity. One reason may be that because the person who is exercising is not taking his or her feet off of the pedals, and exercise can be done at a gentler rate, still getting the same degree of results as with a treadmill. Also, at home, especially in an apartment setting, they are said not to make as much noise as a treadmill may make for one's downstairs neighbours.   A recent study by the University of Idaho [ citation needed ]  shows that varying the stride length on the elliptical trainer can recruit a larger variety of muscle groups. The study also showed that as the stride is lengthened, more calories are burned without any higher rate of perceived exertion by the user. This study lends credibility to the claims made about the adjustable stride length feature on some newer ellipticals.     [ edit ]   Motor fitness   By using the elliptical without holding onto the handgrips, the user can improve his or her motor fitness and balance. [ citation needed ]  In this position, the core muscles are held in a state of constant tension. This hands-free position also promotes better posture. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Usage instructions   The user should adopt a comfortable standing position with his or her spine in a neutral position (with a straight back). The knees, hips and ankles should be kept in alignment. Weight should be distributed between the heels and the balls of the feet.   While gripping the handrails in a smooth controlled motion, the user should stride either forward or reverse, working through a full natural range of movement smoothly and continuously.

Why Purchase a Cross Trainer                                      Elliptical cross trainers  provide an elliptical movement that reduces the stresses and impacts associated with other forms of exercise such as running, or using  exercise bikes  and other types of fitness equipment. As well as protecting joints from strain, shear and compression type injuries, the elliptical engineers also wanted to ensure that any movement required minimal co-ordination, and involved a maximum proportion of the lower body large muscle groups in order to help promote aerobic fitness gains and efficient fat burning. What they came up with was an elliptical or elliptic type movement, where the feet perform an ellipse, whose long axis is aligned roughly parallel to the ground. The cross trainer was born, and with the addition of upper body handles to work the chest back and arms, it quickly evolved into the elliptical trainer! Today, home-use ellipticals are almost as popular as  treadmills , and nowadays there is such a wide range of cross trainer models available                                            Before Buying A Cheap Elliptical Trainer                                      Sometimes purchasing a cheap clearance elliptical trainer can prove to be a risky investment. The elliptical cross trainer is a complex piece of fitness equipment that provides a variety of fitness levels to offer a low impact work out. For this reason, the elliptical trainer must be durable and well built. The elliptical trainer mirrors running and walking somewhat like a treadmill, however the difference is that instead of the foot coming down on a hard surface, the feet move in a smooth, seamless ellipse fashion like using an exercise bike. This eliminates a vast amount of damage to the knees, ankles and joints that a treadmill imposes. As a consumer when purchasing a cheap clearance elliptical trainer, one must do some research before buying. The amount you would expect to pay widely depends on if the elliptical trainer is motorized or non-motorized. Other factors include the brand name, the programs available on the elliptical machine, and other options that the machine offers. Also, one needs to pay attention to the length of stride that the elliptical has to offer. It needs to be a minimum of 20 inches for best effectiveness. There are many UK websites that offer cheap clearance elliptical trainers on sale. A person just needs to be aware of the website and make sure it is a reputable website like us that specialises in  fitness equipment . There are some good legitimate sales on cheap clearance cross trainers but make sure the company is bricks and mortar                                            Features To Look Out For                                      The Braking system   -  almost all elliptical trainers use magnetic braking, and you will need this option if you want programmes. Lower Body Movement Feel   -  the feel of a cross trainer is very subjective. Ideally it should feel smooth throughout the range of movement, with a natural stride pattern  -  not jerky or snatchy, or with a footplate that changes direction very suddenly as it reaches the 'end' of the ellipse. Upper Body Movement Feel  - the handles should be comfortable to grip and without significant play as the handles change direction. Check that at high resistance levels, there's no rocking or instability. Ellipse Stride length adjustment   -  some machines allow you to shorten or lengthen the stride, making it easier to match the machine's movement to your own natural stride pattern.  Console feedback and ease of use  - how clear and comprehensive is the displayed information? How easy is it to access programmes (if there are any)? Are the buttons clearly visible and easy to use? The Maximum workload  - how much workload can the elliptical provide when used flat out? If you're fit look for at least 250 watts. Elliptical Programmes  - some can offer variety and motivation by simulating various hill courses, allowing you to create your own or by controlling your heart rate. Power type   -  some elliptical trainers are self-powered whilst others require a mains connection.
