He painted it on the back wall of the dining hall at the Dominican convent of Sta Maria delle Grazie in Italy. The reason the painting is laid out the way it is is that Leonardo was trying to ""extend the room"", to make it look like Jesus and his apostles were sitting at the end of the dining hall. This painting became an  instant  famous work, for many reasons.         The painting depicts the very moment that Jesus has said to his disciples:    Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.  And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.  And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.  --Matthew 26     The disciples are all reacting in horror to the thought that someone at that table would betray their master.    Fresco vs Tempera  Dan Brown's error in The Da Vinci Code is that he calls the Last Supper a FRESCO. This painting is not a fresco. This is a critical mistake because if the painting had been a fresco, we would still have a superb image to view and examine. It is *because* it is not a fresco that we have all these questions now about what the painting is showing us. In fact, a main reason why the Last Supper painting is so famous is because it is not a fresco - and therefore that it was in essence destroyed immediately after being painted. It's important therefore to understand this issue.    Normally, the way a painting like this would have been done would be a ""fresco"". That means that the plaster is made wet, and then the painting is done on the wet plaster. When the plaster dries, the paint is sort of intermingled with the plaster and it's nice and permanent. However, that type of painting is limited in its colors and can't be retouched. When the plaster dries, you're stuck.   Leonardo wanted to experiment with a new style he had invented - tempera (egg yolk and vinegar) plus oil painting ON dry plaster. That way he could use more colors and redo portions if necessary. The painting took him four years to complete - 1495 to 1498. His patrons were furious at the delay but Leonardo refused to go any more quickly.   Unfortunately, Leonardo's style experiment was a disaster. The paint almost immediately began falling off the plaster. The humidity was causing the paint to separate from the plaster on which it had been painted. Whole pieces of paint fell off the wall. Over the years, the piece has been vandalized and nearly fell apart completely.   A recent 20-year effort tried to stabilize the piece for future viewing. Art experts tried to re-create what they thought the painting must have looked like originally. There is a lot of debate about whether those experts really did ""fix"" the painting, or if they changed its meaning by making changes in color and detail. There's no way to know, really, since the painting had fallen apart so much over the years. Much of what we know about the way this painting was done and the fact that it was NOT a fresco was learned during that repair process. I agree that some websites still claim the painting is a fresco. They are mistaken. You can't trust everything you read on the web :)     The Scene and Design  Leonardo da Vinci was working based on the few known documents which describe this meal. As all artists do, he was trying to convey an impression and message, and took ""artistic license"" with his source material. Just as artists will often rearrange a scene in order to better convey what they are trying to have the viewer feel and think about, so did Leonardo da Vinci rearrange what was *said* about this important event, in order to convey his own thoughts and feelings on the subject. I list a lot of his changes below.   Part of why Leonardo's version was so famous immediately was that he had chosen a very unusual way to portray the scene. Pretty much every painting of the Last Supper up until now had involved Jesus blessing the bread and wine - a nice, serene scene. Judas was always shown off in a corner, sulking, away from the rest of the disciples. This is what the Dominicans thought they were getting. When they instead got this ""violent"" version with the disciples all screaming and yelling, the monks were not exactly pleased. It created a lot of publicity.          Some people are intrigued by the three ""lunettes"" over the painting, not seen in most copies of the painting's image. These are tributes to Leonardo's patron duke. They are in fact the Sforza coat of arms. Leonardo's patron duke was Duke Lodovico Sforza   So the center spot is the arms of the Duke plus his wife Beatrice d'Este. To the left is that of Massimiliano, the first born son. On the right side is Francesco, the second son.     Latin Saying  Some versions of the painting have Latin words beneath it -   Latin Vulgate  26:21 et edentibus illis dixit amen dico vobis quia unus vestrum me traditurus est   King James Version  26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.   So it is simply quoting the passage of the Bible that Leonardo was depicting.    If you're curious, the top version of the Last Supper shown on this page was the pre-restoration version, while the second version is the one after restoration.

But are we sure that everything written about Leonardo’s works is true?              The story is gripping and although it is fiction, it does refer to many real events.              Some of these references concern Leonardo and may mislead readers who may think that some or all of the material is factual.                           1. Is it true that a murderer is hidden in the painting of the Last Supper?  2. Did Leonardo invent the Cryptex?                                                                                 1. Is it true that a murderer is hidden in the painting of the Last Supper?             Perhaps not.                                                                                                                            You can see the painting of the Last Supper in Milan, in the convent of S. Maria delle Grazie. The last restoration made it much brighter and “barer” than it was before. So much so that to see it as a whole, it’s easier to look at a printed reproduction.                            Dan Brown referred to it in his novel ""The Da Vinci Code” as proof of the fact that Leonardo wanted to send us a secret message. The apostle to the right of Christ has a somewhat feminine appearance and in the novel is described as Mary Magdalene.                                                                  1.1 Thirteen people at the table                                                                                                                                                                                             1.2 But how many hands are there?                                                                                                                                                             Here we have highlighted only the hands present in the fresco.                             Like many others before him, Dan Brown quoted the legend based on the wrong number of hands. Look carefully and you’ll see that they all belong to their proper owners.                                                                  1.3 A table for thirteen, please!                                                                                                                                                             Here we have highlighted each pair of hands and used a number to identify which of the 13 people they belong to.              1 Bartholomew, 2 James the Less, 3 Andrew, 4 Peter, 5 Judas, 6 John,            7  Jesus , 8 James the Great, 9 Thomas, 10 Philip, 11 Matthew, 12 Thaddeus and 13 Simon the Zealot.                            Where’s the mystery? Didn’t they say there were more hands than people? Look carefully and count again. They’re all there: Thomas has one of his hands immediately below James the Great’s left hand.                                                                     1.4 And what about Peter and John?                                                                                                                                                             In this close-up we see two apostles who seem to be in conversation. Traditionally, these are understood to be Peter talking to John and putting his hand on his shoulder to reassure him.                             Dan Brown implies that, in fact, Peter’s position, with a knife nearby and his hand on John’s neck, seems to mean he is saying something like, “Behave, or you’re dead!” But what if all it means is that Peter is saying, “Excuse me, but could you pass me that piece of bread over there?” What could be more natural than to have a knife in your hand when the table is covered with food?                                                                     1.5 Threatening or reassuring?                                                                                                                                                             Peter is resting one hand on John’s shoulder to reassure him; his other hand, with the knife, is far away and anyway, at a table full of food, you would have a knife.                            Dan Brown suggests that the position is threatening, but by the looks on their faces the apostles don’t seem to be nervous or terrified. On the contrary, they both look quite relaxed.                                                                     1.6 Preparatory studies                                                                                                                                                     Leonardo’s study for the Last Supper - Galleria dell'Accademia, Venice.  Preparation and digital composition of individual sketches.                                               Leonardo made many preparatory studies for his painting of the Last Supper. None of these show any sign of the mysterious and “dangerous” allegories or symbolism conjured up in Brown’s novel. The study of Da Vinci’s manuscripts is fascinating and he emerges as an even greater and more mysterious figure.                              The novel in question has the value of stimulating the curiosity of people who have never before had any interest in Leonardo, but such people must not be misled. The manuscripts are available to anyone who seriously wants to learn more and to study the real mysteries of this genius.                                                                                2 The Cryptex             Did Leonardo have a secret project?                                                                                                                                                                    These pictures represent the Cryptex, as described in the novel. Dan Brown writes that it was Leonardo da Vinci who had the idea of this miniature combination-lock strongbox. Indeed, the illustrated edition of the book includes a page from Leonardo’s manuscripts with a mechanism that appears to be similar to the one used for the Cryptex. The drawing in question is on a page from Manuscript B, folio 33 verso, to be precise. Leonardo’s design has nothing to do with the strongbox featured in the novel and there is no trace of this mechanism in the other Codices. So the author must have invented it. In fact, the drawings on this folio are: a means of wheeled transport, a cannon spindle and various mechanisms relating to a complex system with tip-up boxes of a size much larger than a lockable document box.                                                                                                                 The page shown to readers of the novel is actually page 33v of Manuscript B. The machine described has nothing whatever to do with the Cryptex.                                                  Manuscript B - folio 33 verso.                              Leonardo’s drawings feature a great many more significant and mysterious mechanisms that deserve our attention: we would do well to study them closely. This is what L3 is all about. The fascination with the Cryptex and the confusion it has aroused is an indication of interest in a subject that should be approached with greater seriousness.                                                         The design for the Cryptex is not by Leonardo.                                                                                                                                                                 The Cryptex described by Dan Brown is a little combination-lock strongbox for documents. It consists of a series of 5 rings set into a cylinder with a plug at the end. Each ring has a cut corresponding to a letter inscribed on the outside.                                       If the rings are rotated so that the cuts/grooves are lined up, then the way is clear for the plug to be removed completely, revealing the contents of the hollow cylinder.

And the one after that. And after that. And then, even more.         Above: The Sopranos Last Supper for Vanity Fair magazine Whenever I see popular blog posts and online articles about something in pop culture that references something historical, I always wonder if the ... ahem,  younger  generations know the origin of the original and how many other interpretations had been created prior to the one they tweeted, tagged, posted on 'digg' or shared on facebook. Such is the case with a link someone sent me of fun parodies based on Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. I'd seen the Soprano's Last Supper photo in Vanity Fair and was familiar with the Legos one, since it had been e-mailed to me a ways back. Along with those, the link included just about every pop culture version you could think of -from the Simpsons to Star Wars. Above: The Last Supper made of Legos This got me wondering if the people viewing it were aware that The Last Supper was a subject for many well known artists from the 14th-20th centuries, not just da Vinci. From Albrecht Durer to Rembrandt, Tintoretto to Blake, the subject was interpreted by almost every painter who painted for money for centuries. Common sense would tell you that, given that biblical scenes and stories dominated the art world long before any other subjects.   But I wondered how many people e-mailing that very link also know that the piece has since been interpreted by the likes of such artists as Salvador Dali, Andy Warhol, Damien Hirst and even photographer David LaChapelle, to name a few. Well, if they didn't, you can e-mail them this post. I'm not going to show you the scads of photoshopped and parody versions out there in cyberspace because so many other bloggers have done that already*. Instead of parodies, I wanted to show you other fine art and photographer's interpretations of Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting. Don't groan... you may just learn something.

clueweb09-enwp00-88-21939	"                     Indigenous Australian art          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (November 2007)              Aboriginal hollowed log coffin       Indigenous Australian art  is art produced by  Indigenous Australians , covering works that pre-date  European colonization  as well as  contemporary art  by  Aboriginal Australians  based on traditional culture.   These have been studied in recent decades and gained increased international recognition. [ 1 ]  Aboriginal Art covers a wide medium including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture,  sandpainting  and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic decorations found on weaponry and also tools.   Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture and was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about the  dreamtime . Similar to how Christians have their own story of the creation of the Earth, the Dreamtime is how the Aboriginals believed the world was created.   But the importance of art to traditional Indigenous life is difficult for non-Indigenous people to understand. To quote  Howard Morphy  (1991): ""Art was, and is, a central component of the traditional  Yolngu  way of life, of significance in the political domain, in the relationships between clans, and in the relations between men and women. Art was and remains an important component of the system of restricted knowledge, and at a more metaphysical level is the major means of recreating ancestral events, ensuring continuity with the ancestral past, and communicating with the spirit world. For example, a rock painting of a  Rainbow Serpent  is not just a picture of a 'Rainbow Serpent'. It is a manifestation of the  Rainbow Serpent  - she resides in the painting, and will come out and devour you if you behave inappropriately towards the painting.   To quote Morphy (1991) again: ""Paintings as ancestral designs do not simply represent the ancestral beings by encoding stories... As far as the  Yolngu  are concerned, the designs are an integral part of the ancestral beings themselves... The designs themselves possess or contain the power of the ancestral being.""

For example, the  Yolngu  people of  Arnhem Land  cover their bodies in elaborate and exquisite designs to ceremonies or traditional dances. The preparation can take many hours, and the finest artists will be sought after for this. The designs drawn on the body are traditional designs, often involving fine cross-hatching and lines of dots, which are owned by the  clan  of the person who is being decorated.   Body painting is thought to have been the inspiration for many of the designs now found in Bark Painting.     [ edit ]   Rock painting          Aboriginal rock painting at  Namadgi National Park  featuring a  Kangaroo ,  Dingoes ,  Emus ,  Humans  and an  Echidna  or  Turtle       Indigenous art includes a range of styles of rock painting:     The cross-hatch or  X-ray  art  from the  Arnhem Land  and  Kakadu  regions of the  Northern Territory , in which the  skeletons  and  viscera  of the animals and humans portrayed are drawn inside the outline, as if by  cross section .   Dot-painting  where intricate  patterns ,  totems  and/or stories are created using dots; and   Stencil art, particularly using the motif of a hand print.             Wiradjuri  painting of Baiame, near  Singleton , NSW. Note that his arms extend to the two trees either side.       More simple designs of straight lines, circles and spirals, are also common, and in many cases are thought to be the origins of some forms of contemporary Aboriginal Art.   A particular type of Aboriginal painting, known as the  Bradshaws , appears on caves in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia . They are named after the European pastoralist, Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891. To Aboriginal people of the region they are known as Gwion Gwion. Traditional Aboriginal art is composed of organic colours and materials, but modern artists often use synthetic paints when creating aboriginal styles.   Aboriginal rock art has been created for a long period of time, with the oldest examples, in West Australia's Pilbara region, and the Olary district of South Australia, estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old. [ 2 ]  Rock art gives us descriptive information about social activities, material culture, economy, environmental change, myth and religion.     [ edit ]   Bark painting   Main article:  Bark Painting   Bark paintings are paintings made by Australian Indigenous artists on pieces of flattened bark taken from trees such as the  stringybark . The designs seen on authentic bark paintings are traditional designs that are owned by the artist, or his or her ""skin"", or clan, and cannot be painted by other artists. While the designs themselves are ancient, the means of painting them on a piece of flattened bark is a relatively modern phenomenon, although there is some evidence that artists would paint designs on the bark walls and roofs of their shelters.   Bark paintings are now regarded as ""Fine Art"", and the finest bark paintings command high prices accordingly on the international art markets. The very best artists are recognized annually in the  National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award .  Bark painting is also quite popular in some countries.     [ edit ]   Aerial desert ""country"" landscapes   From ancient times, Australian aboriginal culture also produced a genre of  aerial landscape art , often titled simply ""country"". It is a kind of  maplike ,  bird's-eye view  of the desert  landscape , and it is often meant to tell a traditional  Dreaming  story. In the distant past, the common media for such artwork were rock, sand or  body painting ; but the tradition continues today in the form of paintings on canvas (see section  Papunya Tula and ""Dot Painting""  below).     [ edit ]   Rock engravings          Engravings at  Terrey Hills , near Sydney, NSW. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an  increase ceremony , whilst the  well-endowed  man may be  Baiame . More details are in  Sydney Rock Engravings .       There are several different types of  Rock art  across Australia, the most famous of which is  Murujuga  in  Western Australia , the  Sydney Rock Engravings  around  Sydney  in  New South Wales , and the  Panaramitee  rock art in  Central Australia .   The rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of  petroglyphs  and includes images of extinct animals such as  Thylacine . Activity prior to the last ice age until  colonisation  are recorded.   The  Sydney Rock Art  has its own peculiar style, not found elsewhere in Australia, with beautiful carved animals, humans, and symbolism.     [ edit ]   Stone arrangements   Stone arrangements in Australia range from the 50m-diameter circles of  Victoria , with 1m-high stones firmly embedded in the ground, to the smaller stone arrangements found throughout Australia, such as those near  Yirrkala  which depict accurate images of the  praus  used by  Macassan   Trepang  fishermen.   See  Aboriginal stone arrangements  for more details.     [ edit ]   Carvings and sculpture     Carved shells -  Riji   Mimih  (or Mimi) small man-like carvings of mythological  impish  creatures. Mimihs are so frail that they never venture out on windy days lest they be swept away like leaf litter. If approached by men they will run into a rock crevice, if no crevice is there, the rocks themselves will open up and seal behind the Mimih.   Necklaces and other  jewellery , such as those from the  Tasmanian Aborigines       [ edit ]   Weaving and string-art     Basket weaving- see  Australian Aboriginal fibrecraft       [ edit ]   Iconography and symbols   The imagery of the Aboriginal culture, as can be seen in many of the sacred sites, rock and cave paintings, used few colours as they were often made from what was available locally. Some colours were mined from ochre pits, being used for both painting and ceremonies, with ochre also traded between clans and at one time could only be collected by specific men within the clan. Other pigments were made from clay, wood ash or animal blood. There were variations in the symbolic representation of some rock art and paintings, depending on the tribe or region of Australia that you belong to, which is still evident today in the modern art work of Aboriginal artists. The dotted motifs of much of today's Aboriginal modern design work has become the trademark of the contemporary Aboriginal Art movement. Its iconic status developed from a culture stretching back into the history of an ancient land, evolving and weaving into desert dreamtime stories.   Certain symbols within the Aboriginal modern art movement retain the same meaning across regions, although the meaning of the same symbols may change within the context of the whole painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely or in clustered groups. When this symbol is used and depending on the Aboriginal tribe you belong to, it can vary in meaning from campfire, tree, hill, digging hole, waterhole or spring. Use of the symbol can be clarified further by the use of colour, such as water being depicted in blue or black.   Many paintings by Aboriginal artists, such as those that represent a 'dreamtime story', are shown from an aerial perspective. The narrative follows the lie of the land, as created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. The modern day rendition is a reinterpretation of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that was the norm for many thousands of years.   Whatever the meaning, interpretations of the icons should be taken in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water.(Source:  Aboriginal Symbols - Indigenous Australia ) [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Religious and cultural aspects of Aboriginal art          Aboriginal art at  Uluru       Traditional Aboriginal art almost always has a mythological undertone relating to the  Dreamtime  of Australian Aborigines. Many modern purists will say if it doesn't contain the spirituality of Aborigines, it is not true Aboriginal art. [ citation needed ]   Wenten Rubuntja , an Aboriginal landscape artist says it's hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning;     ""Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all  Dreaming . There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture."" - source  The Weekend Australian Magazine , April, 2002            Aboriginal art showing  Barramundi  fish       Story telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. Additionally the female form, particularly the female  womb  in X-ray style features prominently in some famous sites in  Arnhem Land .    [ edit ]   Graffiti and other destructive influences   Many culturally significant sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually desecrated and destroyed by encroachment of early settlers and modern-day visitors. This includes the destruction of art by clearing and construction work,  erosion  caused by excessive touching of sites, and graffiti. Many sites now belonging to National Parks have to be strictly monitored by rangers, or closed off to the public permanently. Also recently there have been animals which have gathered some of the rocks to use in nests.     [ edit ]   Contemporary Indigenous art     [ edit ]   Modern Aboriginal artists          Art work by Richard Bell       In 1934 Australian painter Rex Batterbee taught Aboriginal artist  Albert Namatjira  western style watercolour landscape painting, along with other Aboriginal artists at the  Hermannsburg  mission in the  Northern Territory . It became a popular style, known as the  Hermannsburg School , and sold out when the paintings were exhibited in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities. Namatjira became the first Aboriginal Australian citizen, as a result of his fame and popularity with these watercolour paintings.   In 1966, one of  David Malangi 's designs was produced on the Australian one dollar note, originally without his knowledge. The subsequent payment to him by the Reserve Bank marked the first case of Aboriginal copyright in  Australian copyright law .   In 1988 an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander memorial was unveiled at the  National Gallery of Australia  in  Canberra  made from 200 hollow log coffins, which are similar to the type used for mortuary ceremonies in  Arnhem Land . It was made for the bicentenary of Australia's colonisation, and is in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict with settlers. It was created by 43 artists from  Ramingining  and communities nearby. The path running through the middle of it represents the Glyde River.   In that same year, the new  Parliament House  in Canberra opened with a forecourt featuring a design by  Michael Nelson Tjakamarra , laid as a mosaic.   The late  Rover Thomas  is another well known modern Australian Aboriginal artist. Born in  Western Australia , he represented Australia in the  Venice Biennale  of 1991. He knew and encouraged other now well-known artists to paint, including  Queenie McKenzie  from the East  Kimberley  / Warmun region, as well as having a strong influence on the works of  Paddy Bedford  and  Freddy Timms .   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the work of  Emily Kngwarreye  became very popular. Although she had been involved in craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. She was from the  Utopia community  north east of  Alice Springs . Kngwarreye painted for only a few years near the end of her life. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece  Kathleen Petyarre ,  Minnie Pwerle ,  Dorothy Napangardi , Jeannie Petyarre ( Pitjara ) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centers have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work. [ 4 ]   Despite concerns about supply and demand for paintings, the remoteness of many of the artists, and the poverty and health issues experienced in the communities, there are widespread estimates of an industry worth close to half a billion dollars (Aus) and growing rapidly. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Papunya Tula  and ""dot painting""   Main article:  Papunya Tula   In 19711972, art teacher  Geoffrey Bardon  encouraged Aboriginal people in  Papunya , north west of  Alice Springs  to put their  Dreamings  onto canvas. These stories had previously been drawn on the  desert  sand, and were now given a more permanent form.   The dots were used to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the Tula] artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name:  Papunya Tula  Artists Pty Ltd...however a time of disillusionment followed as artists were criticised by their peers for having revealed too much of their sacred heritage. Secret designs restricted to a ritual context were now in the market place, made visible to Australian Aboriginal painting. Much of the Aboriginal art on display in tourist shops traces back to this style developed at  Papunya . The most famous of the artists to come from this movement was  Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri . Also from this movement is  Johnny Warangkula , whose  Water Dreaming at Kalipinya  twice sold at a record price, the second time being $486,500 in 2000.   In 1983, some members of the Papunya movement, unhappy with the way their paintings were sold to private dealers, moved to  Yuendumu  and began painting 36 doors at the school there with their Dreaming stories, which started an art movement there. In 1985 the Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Association was founded at Yuendumu, which co-ordinates the artists in the area. Some of the best-known painters from this movement include  Paddy Japaljarri Stewart , Paddy Tjapaltjarri Sims, Maggie Napangardi Watson and Judy Napangardi Watson.     [ edit ]   Exploitation of artists   There have been cases of some exploitative dealers (known as carpetbaggers) that have sought to profit from the success of the Aboriginal art movements. Since Geoffrey Bardon's time and in the early years of the Papunya movement, there has been concerns about the exploitation of the largely illiterate and non-English speaking artists.   One of the main reasons the Yuendumu movement was established, and later flourished, was due to the feeling of exploitation amongst artists:     ""Many of the artists who played crucial roles in the founding of the art centre were aware of the increasing interest in Aboriginal art during the 1970s and had watched with concern and curiosity the developments of the art movement at Papunya amongst people to whom they were closely related. There was also a growing private market for Aboriginal art in Alice Springs. Artists' experiences of the private market were marked by feelings of frustration and a sense of disempowerment when buyers refused to pay prices which reflected the value of the Jukurrpa or showed little interest in understanding the story. The establishment of Warlukurlangu was one way of ensuring the artists had some control over the purchase and distribution of their paintings."" (Source:  Warlukurlangu Artists )     Other cases of exploitation include:     painting for a lemon (car): ""Artists have come to me and pulled out photos of cars with mobile phone numbers on the back. They're asked to paint 10-15 canvasses in exchange for a car. When the 'Toyotas' materalise, they often arrive with a flat tyre, no spares, no jack, no fuel."" (Coslovich 2003)       preying on a sick artist: ""Even coming to town for medical treatment, such as dialysis, can make an artist easy prey for dealers wanting to make a quick profit who congregate in Alice Springs"" (op.cit.)       pursuing a famous artist: ""The late (great)  Emily Kngwarreye ...was relentlessly pursued by carpetbaggers towards the end of her career and produced a large but inconsistent body of work."" According to Sotheby's ""We take about one in every 20 paintings of hers, and with those we look for provenance we can be 100% sure of."" (op.cit.)     In March 2006, the ABC reported art fraud had hit the Western Australian Aboriginal Art movements. Allegations were made of sweatshop-like conditions, fake works by English backpackers, overpricing and artists posing for photographs for artwork that wasn't theirs. A detective on the case said:     ""People are clearly taking advantage...Especially the elderly people. I mean, these are people that, they're not educated; they haven't had a lot of contact with white people. They've got no real basic understanding, you know, of the law and even business law. Obviously they've got no real business sense. A dollar doesn't really have much of a meaning to them, and I think to treat anybody like that is just it's just not on in this country."" Call for ACCC to investigate Aboriginal Art industry , ABC PM,  March 15 .       [ edit ]   Australian Senate Inquiry into Australia's Indigenous Visual Arts and Craft Sector   In August 2006, following concerns raised about unethical practices in the Indigneous art sector, the Australian Senate initiated an  inquiry  into issues in the sector. Its terms of reference were:     Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, with particular reference to:     the current size and scale of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector;   the economic, social and cultural benefits of the sector;   the overall financial, cultural and artistic sustainability of the sector;   the current and likely future priority infrastructure needs of the sector;   opportunities for strategies and mechanisms that the sector could adopt to improve its practices, capacity and sustainability, including to deal with unscrupulous or unethical conduct;   opportunities for existing government support programs for Indigenous visual arts and crafts to be more effectively targeted to improve the sector's capacity and future sustainability; and   future opportunities for further growth of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, including through further developing international markets.       The inquiry was conducted over ten months, gathering evidence from around the country, including public hearings in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Sydney and Canberra. In February 2007, the Senate inquiry heard from the Northern Territory Art Minister,  Marion Scrymgour , that backpackers were often the artists of Aboriginal art being sold in tourist shops around Australia. Of particular concern was the art on didgeridoos:     ""The material they call Aboriginal art is almost exclusively the work of fakers, forgers and fraudsters. Their work hides behind false descriptions and dubious designs. The overwhelming majority of the ones you see in shops throughout the country, not to mention Darling, are fanks pure and simple. There is some anecdotal evidence here in Darwin at least, they have been painted by backpackers working on industrial scale wood production."" Sydney Morning Herald (2007) Backpackers fake Aboriginal art, Senate told     The inquiry's  final report , handed down on  21 June   2007 , made 29 recommendations, including:     greater public funding for infrastructure in the sector   more intensive policing efforts to try and eliminate unethical business practices   adoption of a code of practice across the sector   government agencies and collecting institutions to implement a code when dealing with Indigenous visual art     The report also raised the prospect of law reforms if necessary to change the way the industry was regulated.     [ edit ]   Aboriginal art movements and cooperatives   Main article:  List of Australian Indigenous art movements and cooperatives   Australian Indigenous art momvements and cooperatives have been central to the emergence of Indigenous Australian art. Whereas many western artists pursue formal training and work as individuals, most contemporary Indigenous art is created in community groups and art centres. [ 6 ]   Many of the centres operate online art galleries where local and international visitors can purchase works directly from the communities without the need of going through an intermediary. The cooperatives reflect the diversity of art across indigenous Australia from the north west region where ochre is significantly used; to the tropical north where the use of cross-hatching prevails; to the Papunya style of art from the central desert cooperatives. Art is increasingly becoming a significant source of income and livelihood for some of these communities.

Depictions of elegant human figures, richly hued animals, and figures combining human and animal features—called  therianthropes  and associated with shamanism—continue to inspire admiration for their sophistication, energy, and direct, powerful forms. The apparent universality of these images is deceptive; content and style range widely over the African continent. Nevertheless, African rock art can be divided into three broad geographical zones— southern ,  central , and  northern . The art of each of these zones is distinctive and easily recognizable, even to an untrained eye.     Not all rock art in these three zones is prehistoric; in some areas these arts flourished into the late nineteenth century, while in other areas rock art continues to be made today. In the Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa, a number of rock paintings depict clashes between San (Bushmen) people and European colonists mounted on horses and armed with rifles. Many of the Drakensberg works use subtle polychrome shading that gives their subjects a hint of three-dimensional presence. The product of many authors, time periods, and cultures, the flowing naturalism and lively sense of movement of the best rock art attests to the conviction of masterful hands and trained eyes.

Image courtesy of the South African Museum, Cape Town.  This rock painting was extricated from a shelter in the Drakensberg Mountains and currently resides in the South African Museum, Cape Town. Its images of antelopes and humans have been interpreted as evocations of Khoisan trance experiences. Beautifully rendered in subtle tones of red and white, this is among the most famous South African rock paintings. Although its date of execution is not known, it is estimated to have been painted sometime during the eighteenth or nineteenth centuries  A.D.

clueweb09-en0002-47-07116	"                     Indigenous Australian art          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (November 2007)              Aboriginal hollowed log coffin       Indigenous Australian art  is art produced by  Indigenous Australians , covering works that pre-date  European colonization  as well as  contemporary art  by  Aboriginal Australians  based on traditional culture.   It has a history which covers over 30,000 years, and represents a large range of native traditions and styles. These have been studied in recent decades and gained increased international recognition. [ 1 ]  Aboriginal Art covers a wide medium including painting on leaves, wood carving, rock carving, sculpture,  sandpainting  and ceremonial clothing, as well as artistic embellishments found on weaponry and also tools.   Art is one of the key rituals of Aboriginal culture and was and still is, used to mark territory, record history, and tell stories about the  dreamtime . Similar to how Christians have their own story of the creation of the Earth, the Dreamtime is how the Aboriginals believed the world was created.   But the importance of art to traditional Indigenous life is difficult for non-Indigenous people to understand. To quote  Howard Morphy  (1991): ""Art was, and is, a central component of the traditional  Yolngu  way of life, of significance in the political domain, in the relationships between clans, and in the relations between men and women. Art was and remains an important component of the system of restricted knowledge, and at a more metaphysical level is the major means of recreating ancestral events, ensuring continuity with the ancestral past, and communicating with the spirit world. For example, a rock painting of a  Rainbow Serpent  is not just a picture of a 'Rainbow Serpent'. It is a manifestation of the  Rainbow Serpent  - she resides in the painting, and will come out and devour you if you behave inappropriately towards the painting.   To quote Morphy (1991) again: ""Paintings as ancestral designs do not simply represent the ancestral beings by encoding stories... As far as the  Yolngu  are concerned, the designs are an integral part of the ancestral beings themselves... The designs themselves possess or contain the power of the ancestral being.""

For example, the  Yolngu  people of  Arnhem Land  cover their bodies in elaborate and exquisite john to ceremonies or traditional dances. The preparation can take many hours, and the finest artists will be sought after for this. The designs drawn on the body are traditional designs, often involving fine cross-hatching and lines of dots, which are owned by the  clan  of the person who is being decorated.   Body painting is thought to have been the inspiration for many of the designs now found in Bark Painting.     [ edit ]   Rock Painting          Aboriginal rock painting at  Namadgi National Park  featuring a  Kangaroo ,  Dingoes ,  Emus ,  Humans  and an  Echidna  or  Turtle               Wiradjuri  painting of Baiame, near  Singleton , NSW. Note that his arms extend to the two trees either side.              Rock art in  Carnarvon Gorge       Rock painting  can be found in most parts of  Australia , ranging from simple hand or boomerang stencils to elaborate X-ray pictures.   Traditionally, paints were often made from water, animal fats or  spittle  mixed with ochre and other rock pigments and sometimes had vegetable fibers added. Painting was then performed on people's bodies, rock walls or bark (particular that of the  paperbark   gum ). Tools used included primitive  brushes ,  sticks , fingers and even a technique of spraying the paint directly out of the mouth onto the medium resulting in an effect similar to modern  spraypaint . Aboriginal Art can be made up of a series of dots, lines, or just the outline of a shape.   There are a wide variety of styles of Aboriginal art. Three common types are     The cross-hatch or  X-ray  art  from the  Arnhem Land  and  Kakadu  regions of the  Northern Territory , in which the  skeletons  and  viscera  of the animals and humans portrayed are drawn inside the outline, as if by  cross section ;       Dot-painting  where intricate  patterns ,  totems  and/or stories are created using dots; and       Stencil art, particularly using the motif of a hand print.     More simple designs of straight lines, circles and spirals, are also common, and in many cases are thought to be the origins of some forms of contemporary Aboriginal Art.   A particular type of Aboriginal painting, known as the  Bradshaws , appears on caves in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia . They are named after the European pastoralist, Joseph Bradshaw, who first reported them in 1891. To Aboriginal people of the region they are known as Gwion Gwion. Traditional Aboriginal art is composed of organic colours and materials, but modern artists often use synthetic paints when creating aboriginal styles.   Aboriginal art involves story telling, myths, rituals, sorcery and magic.   Aboriginal rock art has been created for a long period of time, with the oldest examples, in West Australia's Pilbara region, and the Olary district of South Australia, estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old. [ 2 ]  Rock art gives us descriptive information about social activities, material culture, economy, environmental change, myth and religion.     [ edit ]   Bark painting       Main article:  Bark Painting       Bark paintings are paintings made by Australian Indigenous artists on pieces of flattened bark taken from trees such as the  stringybark . The designs seen on authentic bark paintings are traditional designs that are owned by the artist, or his or her ""skin"", or clan, and cannot be painted by other artists. While the designs themselves are ancient, the means of painting them on a piece of flattened bark is a relatively modern phenomenon, although there is some evidence that artists would paint designs on the bark walls and roofs of their shelters.   Bark paintings are now regarded as ""Fine Art"", and the finest bark paintings command high prices accordingly on the international art markets. The very best artists are recognized annually in the  National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award .  Bark painting is also quite popular in some countries.     [ edit ]   Aerial desert ""country"" landscapes   From ancient times, Australian aboriginal culture also produced a genre of  aerial landscape art , often titled simply ""country"". It is a kind of  maplike ,  bird's-eye view  of the desert  landscape , and it is often meant to tell a traditional  Dreaming  story. In the distant past, the common media for such artwork were rock, sand or  body painting ; but the tradition continues today in the form of paintings on canvas (see section  Papunya Tula and ""Dot Painting""  below).     [ edit ]   Rock Engravings          Engravings at  Terrey Hills , near Sydney, NSW. The two kangaroos suggest this was used for an  increase ceremony , whilst the well-endowed man may be  Baiame . More details are in  Sydney Rock Engravings .       There are several different types of  Rock art  across Australia, the most famous of which is  Murujuga  in  Western Australia , the  Sydney Rock Engravings  around  Sydney  in  New South Wales , and the  Panaramitee  rock art in  Central Australia .   The rock art at Murujuga is said to be the world's largest collection of  petroglyphs  and includes images of extinct animals such as  Thylacine . Activity prior to the last ice age until  colonisation  are recorded.   The  Sydney Rock Art  has its own peculiar style, not found elsewhere in Australia, with beautiful carved animals, humans, and symbolism.     [ edit ]   Stone Arrangements   Stone arrangements in Australia range from the 50m-diameter circles of  Victoria , with 1m-high stones firmly embedded in the ground, to the smaller stone arrangements found throughout Australia, such as those near  Yirrkala  which depict accurate images of the  praus  used by  Macassan   Trepang  fishermen.   See  Aboriginal stone arrangements  for more details.     [ edit ]   Carvings and sculpture     Carved shells -  Riji   Mimih  (or Mimi) small man-like carvings of mythological  impish  creatures. Mimihs are so frail that they never venture out on windy days lest they be swept away like leaf litter. If approached by men they will run into a rock crevice, if no crevice is there, the rocks themselves will open up and seal behind the Mimih.   Necklaces and other  jewellery , such as those from the  Tasmanian Aborigines       [ edit ]   Weaving and String-Art     Basket weaving- see  Australian Aboriginal fibrecraft       [ edit ]   Iconography and Symbols   The imagery of the Aboriginal culture, as can be seen in many of the sacred sites, rock and cave paintings, used few colours as they were often made from what was available locally. Some colours were mined from ochre pits, being used for both painting and ceremonies, with ochre also traded between clans and at one time could only be collected by specific men within the clan. Other pigments were made from clay, wood ash or animal blood. There were variations in the symbolic representation of some rock art and paintings, depending on the tribe or region of Australia that you belong to, which is still evident today in the modern art work of Aboriginal artists. The dotted motifs of much of today's Aboriginal modern design work has become the trademark of the contemporary Aboriginal Art movement. Its iconic status developed from a culture stretching back into the history of an ancient land, evolving and weaving into desert dreamtime stories.   Certain symbols within the Aboriginal modern art movement retain the same meaning across regions, although the meaning of the same symbols may change within the context of the whole painting. When viewed in monochrome other symbols can look similar, such as the circles within circles, sometimes depicted on their own, sparsely or in clustered groups. When this symbol is used and depending on the Aboriginal tribe you belong to, it can vary in meaning from campfire, tree, hill, digging hole, waterhole or spring. Use of the symbol can be clarified further by the use of colour, such as water being depicted in blue or black.   Many paintings by Aboriginal artists, such as those that represent a 'dreamtime story', are shown from an aerial perspective. The narrative follows the lie of the land, as created by ancestral beings in their journey or during creation. The modern day rendition is a reinterpretation of songs, ceremonies, rock art and body art that was the norm for many thousands of years.   Whatever the meaning, interpretations of the icons should be taken in context of the entire painting, the region from which the artist originates, the story behind the painting, the style of the painting, with additional clues being the colours used in some of the more modern works, such as blue circles signifying water.(Source:  Aboriginal Symbols - Indigenous Australia ) [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Religious and cultural aspects of Aboriginal art          Aboriginal art at  Uluru       Traditional Aboriginal art almost always has a mythological undertone relating to the  Dreamtime  of Australian Aborigines. Many modern purists will say if it doesn't contain the spirituality of Aborigines, it is not true Aboriginal art. [ citation needed ]   Wenten Rubuntja , an Aboriginal landscape artist says it's hard to find any art that is devoid of spiritual meaning;     ""Doesn't matter what sort of painting we do in this country, it still belongs to the people, all the people. This is worship, work, culture. It's all  Dreaming . There are two ways of painting. Both ways are important, because that's culture."" - source  The Weekend Australian Magazine , April, 2002            Aboriginal art showing  Barramundi  fish       Story telling and totem representation feature prominently in all forms of Aboriginal artwork. Additionally the female form, particularly the female  womb  in X-ray style features prominently in some famous sites in  Arnhem Land .    [ edit ]   Graffiti and other destructive influences   Many culturally significant sites of Aboriginal rock paintings have been gradually desecrated and destroyed by encroachment of early settlers and modern-day visitors. This includes the destruction of art by clearing and construction work,  erosion  caused by excessive touching of sites, and graffiti. Many sites now belonging to National Parks have to be strictly monitored by rangers, or closed off to the public permanently. Also recently there have been animals which have gathered some of the rocks to use in nests.     [ edit ]   Contemporary Indigenous Art     [ edit ]   Modern Aboriginal Artists          Art work by Richard Bell       In 1934 Australian painter Rex Batterbee taught Aboriginal artist  Albert Namatjira  western style watercolour landscape painting, along with other Aboriginal artists at the  Hermannsburg  mission in the  Northern Territory . It became a popular style, known as the  Hermannsburg School , and sold out when the paintings were exhibited in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities. Namatjira became the first Aboriginal Australian citizen, as a result of his fame and popularity with these watercolour paintings.   In 1966, one of  David Malangi 's designs was produced on the Australian one dollar note, originally without his knowledge. The subsequent payment to him by the Reserve Bank marked the first case of Aboriginal copyright in  Australian copyright law .   In 1988 an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander memorial was unveiled at the  National Gallery of Australia  in  Canberra  made from 200 hollow log coffins, which are similar to the type used for mortuary ceremonies in  Arnhem Land . It was made for the bicentenary of Australia's colonisation, and is in remembrance of Aboriginal people who had died protecting their land during conflict with settlers. It was created by 43 artists from  Ramingining  and communities nearby. The path running through the middle of it represents the Glyde River.   In that same year, the new  Parliament House  in Canberra opened with a forecourt featuring a design by  Michael Nelson Tjakamarra , laid as a mosaic.   The late  Rover Thomas  is another well known modern Australian Aboriginal artist. Born in  Western Australia , he represented Australia in the  Venice Biennale  of 1991. He knew and encouraged other now well-known artists to paint, including  Queenie McKenzie  from the East  Kimberley  / Warmun region, as well as having a strong influence on the works of  Paddy Bedford  and  Freddy Timms .   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the work of  Emily Kngwarreye  became very popular. Although she had been involved in craftwork for most of her life, it was only when she was in her 80s that she was recognised as a painter. She was from the  Utopia community  north east of  Alice Springs . Kngwarreye painted for only a few years near the end of her life. Her styles, which changed every year, have been seen as a mixture of traditional Aboriginal and contemporary Australian. Her rise in popularity has prefigured that of many Indigenous artists from central, northern and western Australia, such as Kngwarreye's niece  Kathleen Petyarre ,  Minnie Pwerle ,  Dorothy Napangardi , Jeannie Petyarre ( Pitjara ) and dozens of others, all of whose works have become highly sought-after. The popularity of these often elderly artists, and the resulting pressure placed upon them and their health, has become such an issue that some art centers have stopped selling these artists' paintings online, instead placing prospective clients on a waiting list for work. [ 4 ]   Despite concerns about supply and demand for paintings, the remoteness of many of the artists, and the poverty and health issues experienced in the communities, there are widespread estimates of an industry worth close to half a billion dollars (Aus) and growing rapidly. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Papunya Tula  and ""Dot Painting""       Main article:  Papunya Tula       In 19711972, art teacher  Geoffrey Bardon  encouraged Aboriginal people in  Papunya , north west of  Alice Springs  to put their  Dreamings  onto canvas. These stories had previously been drawn on the  desert  sand, and were now given a more permanent form.   The dots were used to cover secret-sacred ceremonies. Originally, the paintings were used in addition to the oral history of Aboriginal  dreamings  and so they were made for cultural purposes and not the art market. The dots are, in effect, a form of camouflage:     ""In 1972, the [Papunya Tula] artists succeeded in forming their own company with an Aboriginal Name:  Papunya Tula  Artists Pty Ltd...however a time of disillusionment followed as artists were criticised by their peers for having revealed too much of their sacred heritage. Secret designs restricted to a ritual context were now in the market place, made visible to kardiya outsiders and Aboriginal women. In response to these objections, all detailed depictions of human figures, fully decorated tjurungas (bullroarers) and ceremonial paraphernalia were removed or modified. Such designs and their 'inside' meanings were not to be written down and 'traded'. Any contravention broke the immutable plan of descent, the link of the initiated men with his totemic ancestor through his father and his father's father. From 1973 to 1975, Papunya Tula artists sought to camouflage overt references to ceremony and became reticent. They revealed less of the sacred heart of their culture. The openness of the Bardon era was at an end. Dotting and over-dotting, as an ideal means of concealing or painting over dangerous, secret designs, became a fashion at this stage. The art was made public, watered down for general exhibition, pointing to the uniqueness of the  Geoffrey Bardon  years - which like innocence, cannot be rediscovered."" (Judith Ryan in Bardon 1991: ix-x)     Eventually the style, known as the  Papunya Tula  school, or sometimes popularly as 'dot art', became the most recognisable form of Australian Aboriginal painting. Much of the Aboriginal art on display in tourist shops traces back to this style developed at  Papunya . The most famous of the artists to come from this movement was  Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri . Also from this movement is  Johnny Warangkula , whose  Water Dreaming at Kalipinya  twice sold at a record price, the second time being $486,500 in 2000.   In 1983, some members of the Papunya movement, unhappy with the way their paintings were sold to private dealers, moved to  Yuendumu  and began painting 36 doors at the school there with their Dreaming stories, which started an art movement there. In 1985 the Warlukurlangu Artists Aboriginal Association was founded at Yuendumu, which co-ordinates the artists in the area. Some of the best-known painters from this movement include  Paddy Japaljarri Stewart , Paddy Tjapaltjarri Sims, Maggie Napangardi Watson and Judy Napangardi Watson.     [ edit ]   Exploitation of Artists   There have been cases of some exploitative dealers (known as carpetbaggers) that have sought to profit from the success of the Aboriginal art movements. Since Geoffrey Bardon's time and in the early years of the Papunya movement, there has been concerns about the exploitation of the largely illiterate and non-English speaking artists.   One of the main reasons the Yuendumu movement was established, and later flourished, was due to the feeling of exploitation amongst artists:     ""Many of the artists who played crucial roles in the founding of the art centre were aware of the increasing interest in Aboriginal art during the 1970s and had watched with concern and curiosity the developments of the art movement at Papunya amongst people to whom they were closely related. There was also a growing private market for Aboriginal art in Alice Springs. Artists' experiences of the private market were marked by feelings of frustration and a sense of disempowerment when buyers refused to pay prices which reflected the value of the Jukurrpa or showed little interest in understanding the story. The establishment of Warlukurlangu was one way of ensuring the artists had some control over the purchase and distribution of their paintings."" (Source:  Warlukurlangu Artists )     Other cases of exploitation include:     painting for a lemon (car): ""Artists have come to me and pulled out photos of cars with mobile phone numbers on the back. They're asked to paint 10-15 canvasses in exchange for a car. When the 'Toyotas' materalise, they often arrive with a flat tyre, no spares, no jack, no fuel."" (Coslovich 2003)       preying on a sick artist: ""Even coming to town for medical treatment, such as dialysis, can make an artist easy prey for dealers wanting to make a quick profit who congregate in Alice Springs"" (op.cit.)       pursuing a famous artist: ""The late (great)  Emily Kngwarreye ...was relentlessly pursued by carpetbaggers towards the end of her career and produced a large but inconsistent body of work."" According to Sotheby's ""We take about one in every 20 paintings of hers, and with those we look for provenance we can be 100% sure of."" (op.cit.)     In March 2006, the ABC reported art fraud had hit the Western Australian Aboriginal Art movements. Allegations were made of sweatshop-like conditions, fake works by English backpackers, overpricing and artists posing for photographs for artwork that weren't theirs. A detective on the case said:     ""People are clearly taking advantage...Especially the elderly people. I mean, these are people that, they're not educated; they haven't had a lot of contact with white people. They've got no real basic understanding, you know, of the law and even business law. Obviously they've got no real business sense. A dollar doesn't really have much of a meaning to them, and I think to treat anybody like that is just& it's just not on in this country."" Call for ACCC to investigate Aboriginal Art industry , ABC PM,  March 15 .       [ edit ]   Fraud   Fraud can be a problem for high profile artists whose works attract high prices, especially in the secondary market. This has arisen as a problem for Australian Indigenous art, particularly in the last decade.   The late Ginger Riley Munduwalawala (c.1937-2002), a Mara elder from Borroloola in south-east Arnhem Land, revealed in 1999 that he had ""risked his career by revealing he had signed at least 50 forged paintings under duress while drunk."" This admission sparked a brief investigation into Aboriginal art forgeries.  The Age (2002) Ginger Riley, the 'boss of colour', dies     [ edit ]   Australian Senate Inquiry into Australia's Indigenous Visual Arts and Craft Sector   In August 2006, following concerns raised about unethical practices in the Indigneous art sector, the Australian Senate initiated an  inquiry  into issues in the sector. Its terms of reference were:     Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, with particular reference to:     the current size and scale of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector;   the economic, social and cultural benefits of the sector;   the overall financial, cultural and artistic sustainability of the sector;   the current and likely future priority infrastructure needs of the sector;   opportunities for strategies and mechanisms that the sector could adopt to improve its practices, capacity and sustainability, including to deal with unscrupulous or unethical conduct;   opportunities for existing government support programs for Indigenous visual arts and crafts to be more effectively targeted to improve the sector's capacity and future sustainability; and   future opportunities for further growth of Australia's Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, including through further developing international markets.       The inquiry was conducted over ten months, gathering evidence from around the country, including public hearings in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Sydney and Canberra. In February 2007, the Senate inquiry heard from the Northern Territory Art Minister,  Marion Scrymgour , that backpackers were often the artists of Aboriginal art being sold in tourist shops around Australia. Of particular concern was the art on didgeridoos:     ""The material they call Aboriginal art is almost exclusively the work of fakers, forgers and fraudsters. Their work hides behind false descriptions and dubious designs. The overwhelming majority of the ones you see in shops throughout the country, not to mention Darling, are fanks pure and simple. There is some anecdotal evidence here in Darwin at least, they have been painted by backpackers working on industrial scale wood production."" Sydney Morning Herald (2007) Backpackers fake Aboriginal art, Senate told     The inquiry's  final report , handed down on  21 June   2007 , made 29 recommendations, including:     greater public funding for infrastructure in the sector   more intensive policing efforts to try and eliminate unethical business practices   adoption of a code of practice across the sector   government agencies and collecting institutions to implement a code when dealing with Indigenous visual art     The report also raised the prospect of law reforms if necessary to change the way the industry was regulated.     [ edit ]   Aboriginal Art Movements and Co-operatives   The following external sites are links to some of the Aboriginal-owned and -operated art cooperatives. Many of these sites contain an online art gallery where local and international visitors can purchase works directly from the communities without the need of going through an intermedilaiary. These cooperatives show the diversity of art across indigenous Australia from the north west region where oscachre is significantly used; to the tropical north where the use of cross-hatching prevails; to the Papunya style of art from the central desert cooperatives.

It represents the scene of  The Last Supper  from the final days of  Jesus  as narrated in the  Gospel of John  13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve Apostles  would betray him.

The theme was a traditional one for  refectories , but Leonardo's interpretation gave it much greater realism and depth. The  lunettes  above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with  Sforza   coats-of-arms . The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the  Crucifixion  fresco by  Giovanni Donato da Montorfano , to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera. (These figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has  The Last Supper .) Leonardo began work on  The Last Supper  in 1495 and completed it in 1498however, he did not work on the piece continuously throughout this period. This beginning date is not certain, as ""the archives of the convent have been destroyed and our meagre documents date from 1497 when the painting was nearly finished."" [ 1 ]   The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock. From left to right:     Bartholomew ,  James, son of Alphaeus  and  Andrew  form a group of three, all are surprised.   Judas Iscariot ,  Peter  and  John  form another group of three. Judas is wearing green and blue and is in shadow, looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role within the 12 disciples as treasurer. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table; traditionally a sign of bad manners. Peter looks angry and is holding a knife pointed away from Christ, perhaps foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during Jesus' arrest. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon.   ( Jesus )   Thomas ,  James the Greater  and  Philip  are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.   Matthew ,  Jude Thaddeus  and  Simon the Zealot  are the final group of three. Both Jude Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.     These names are all agreed upon by art historians. In the 19th century, a  manuscript  ( The Notebooks Leonardo Da Vinci  pg. 232) was found with their names; before this only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus were positively identified.   In common with other depictions of The Last Supper from this period, Leonardo adopts the convention of seating the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them have their backs to the viewer. However, most previous depictions had typically excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus. Another technique commonly used was placing halos around all the disciples except Judas. Leonardo creates a more dramatic and realistic effect by having Judas lean back into shadow. He also creates a realistic and psychologically engaging means to explain why Judas takes the bread at the same time as Jesus, just after Jesus has predicted that this is what his betrayer will do. Jesus is shown saying this to Saints Thomas and James to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread, as, unseen by him, Jesus too stretches out with his right hand towards it. (Matthew 26: 17-46). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose head is located at the  vanishing point  for all perspective lines.   The painting contains several references to the number 3, which may be an allusion to the  Holy Trinity . The Apostles are seated in groupings of three; there are three windows behind Jesus; and the shape of Jesus' figure resembles a  triangle . There may have been other references that have since been lost to the painting's deterioration.     [ edit ]   Medium   Leonardo painted  The Last Supper  on a dry wall rather than on wet  plaster , so it is not a true  fresco . Because a fresco cannot be modified as the artist works, Leonardo instead chose to seal the stone wall with a layer of  pitch ,  gesso  and  mastic , then paint onto the sealing layer with  tempera . Because of the method used, the piece has not withstood time very well  within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Two early copies of  The Last Supper  are known to exist, presumably the work of Leonardo's assistant. The copies are almost the size of the original, and have survived with a wealth of original detail still intact. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Damage and restorations   As early as 1517 the painting was starting to flake. By 1556less than sixty years after it was finished  Leonardo's  biographer   Giorgio Vasari  described the painting as already ""ruined"" and so deteriorated that the figures were unrecognizable. In 1652 a doorway was cut through the (then unrecognisable) painting, and later bricked up; this can still be seen as the irregular  arch  shaped structure near the center base of the painting. It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768 a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.   A first restoration was attempted in 1726 by Michelangelo Bellotti, who filled in missing sections with  oil paint  then  varnished  the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by  Giuseppe Mazza . Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796  French   troops  used the refectory as an  armory ; they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. The refectory was then later used as a  prison ; it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821  Stefano Barezzi , an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the centre section before realising that Leonardo's work was not a  fresco . Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with  glue . From 1901 to 1908,  Luigi Cavenaghi  first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924  Oreste Silvestri  did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with  stucco .   During  World War II , on  August 15 ,  1943 , the refectory was struck by a  bomb ; protective  sandbagging  prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters, but it may have been damaged further by the  vibration . From 1951 to 1954 another clean-and-stabilise restoration was undertaken by Mauro Pelliccioli.     [ edit ]   Major restoration          The painting as it looked in the 1970s       The painting's appearance in the late 1970s was badly deteriorated and unrecognizable. From 1978 to 1999  Pinin Brambilla Barcilon  guided a major restoration project which undertook to permanently stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt, pollution, and the misguided 18th and 19th century restoration attempts. Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed,  climate controlled  environment, which meant bricking up the windows. Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially  infrared   reflectoscopy  and microscopic core-samples), and original  cartoons  preserved in the Royal Library at  Windsor Castle . Some areas were deemed unrestorable. These were re-painted with  watercolour  in subdued colours intended to indicate they were not original work, whilst not being too distracting.   This restoration took 21 years and on  May 28 ,  1999  the painting was put back on display, although intending visitors are required to book ahead and can only stay for 15 minutes. When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colours, tones, and even some facial shapes.  James Beck ,  professor  of  art history  at  Columbia University  and founder of  ArtWatch International , had been a particularly strong critic.     [ edit ]   Rumours and alternative theories   A common rumour surrounding the painting is that the same model was used for both Jesus and Judas. The story often goes that the innocent-looking young man, a baker, posed at nineteen for Jesus. Some years later Leonardo discovered a hard-bitten criminal as the model for Judas, not realizing he was the same man. There is no evidence that Leonardo used the same model for both figures and the story usually overestimates the time it took Leonardo to finish the mural. [ 3 ]   Some writers identify the person to Jesus' right not with the Apostle John (as is supposed by icongraphical tradition and confirmed by art historians) but with  Mary Magdalene . This theory was the topic of the book  The Templar Revelation , and plays a central role in  Dan Brown 's novel  The Da Vinci Code  (2003).   Critics of these theories will point out that:          Castagno's version of  The Last Supper , depicting St. John sleeping         Leonardo was requested to paint the Last Supper, which naturally included Jesus and his Twelve Apostles. As there are only thirteen figures in the painting, an apostle would have been missing to make way for Mary Magdalene. Somebody would have noted a missing male apostle earlier. Some have suggested that on the front of the figure of  Simon Peter  there is one hand with a dagger which is associated to nobody in the picture, but in  clearer reproductions  this is seen to be Peter's right hand, resting against his hip with the palm turned outward; the knife points towards  Bartholomew  (far left) who was to be executed by being  flayed . It may also indicate Peter's impulsive nature, as he cuts off a soldier's ear in John 18:10. A detailed preliminary drawing of the arm exists. [ 4 ]   The figure in question is wearing male clothing.   Some of the painting's cartoons (preliminary sketches) are preserved, and none show female faces.   Other paintings from that period ( Castagno's  1447 and  Ghirlandaio 's 1480) also show John to be a very boyish or feminine looking figure with long fair hair. [ 5 ]  This was because John was supposed to have been the youngest and most unquestioningly devoted of the apostles. Hence he is often shown asleep against Jesus's shoulder. It was common in the period to show neophytes as very young or even feminine figures, as a way of showing their inferior position.   Leonardo also portrayed a male saint with similar effeminate features in his painting  St. John the Baptist .     There have also been other popular speculations about the work:     It has been suggested that there is no cup in the painting, yet Jesus' left hand is pointing to the  Eucharist  and his right to a glass of wine. (There are several glasses on the table, but they are difficult to see owing to the work's deterioration and restorations.) This is not the glorified chalice of legend as Leonardo insisted on realistic paintings. He often criticised  Michelangelo  for painting muscular, superhuman figures in the  Sistine Chapel .   It is claimed that if one looks above the figure of Bartholemew, a Grail-like image appears on the wall. Whether Leonardo meant this to be a representation of the  Holy Grail  cannot be known, since as pointed out earlier there is a glass on the table within Christ's reach. The ""Grail image"" has become noticed probably because it only appears when viewing the painting in small scale reproductions.  Zooming in  on the painting reveals a cluster of geometrical shapes, possibly intended to represent marble wall decoration, or more likely, paneling on a door. [ 6 ]  They only appear to form a golden chalice when parts are deliberately occluded.            Leonardo da Vinci's  The Last Supper  superimposed with its mirror image       Slavisa Pesci, ""an information technologist and amateur scholar"",  superimposed  Leonardo da Vinci's version of  The Last Supper  with its mirror image (with both images of Jesus lined up) and claimed [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  that the resultant picture has:     a Templar knight on the far left   a woman in orange holds a swaddled baby in arms to the left of Christ   the Holy Grail used in the first Eucharist     Giovanni Maria Pala, an Italian musician, has indicated that the positions of hands and loaves of bread can be interpreted as notes on a musical staff, and if read from right to left, as was characteristic of Da Vinci's writing, form a  musical composition . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   The Last Supper in culture     [ edit ]   Painting, mosaic and photography   A fine 16th century oil on canvas copy is conserved in the abbey of  Tongerlo ,  Antwerp ,  Belgium . It reveals many details that are no longer visible on the original. [ 11 ]  The  Roman   mosaic  artist  Giacomo Raffaelli  made another life-sized copy (1809-1814) in the  Viennese   Minoritenkirche .   In 1955, the renowned artist  Salvador Dali  painted  The Sacrament of the Last Supper , with Jesus portrayed as blonde and clean shaven, pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified. It has been generally considered a masterpiece, and is reputed to be one of the most popular paintings in the collection of the  National Gallery of Art  in  Washington, D.C.   In more recent times, the painting has also been much imitated and parodied in art and photography. Mary Beth Edelson's ""Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper"" (1971) reproduced the composition with  Georgia O'Keeffe  in the central position. Likewise,  Yo Mama's Last Supper , a controversial work of art by  Rene Cox , was a montage of five photographs of twelve black men and a naked black woman (the artist's self portrait) posed in imitation of Leonardo's painting. Cox is pictured naked and standing, with her arms reaching upwards, as Jesus. The piece is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and received acclaim and criticism in heavy measure, the latter notably by former mayor of New York City,  Rudy Giuliani .     [ edit ]   Modern art           The Last Supper  made in salt in  Wieliczka Salt Mine  ( Poland )       In 1988, modern artist  Vik Muniz  famously displayed a recreation of The Last Supper, made entirely out of  Bosco Chocolate Syrup . [ 12 ]   In 2007, Pennsylvania artist Mark Beekman created the world's largest  Lite-Brite  of  The Last Supper , breaking the record held by the previous Guinness record holder for largest Lite-Brite object. As of December 2007, the object was being auctioned on eBay. [ citation needed ]   On  30 July   2008  ""The Last Supper"" was the subject of an animation by British film-maker,  Peter Greenaway , who projected interpretative images onto its surface to bring the scene to life. [ 13 ]  His plans to do so had faced criticism and concerns that it would damage the work, [ 14 ]  but eventually went ahead when the proviso was given that the show would only occur once.

(October 2008)               Mel Brooks 's parody of  The Last Supper  from  History of the World, Part 1       The painting has been  parodied  in several  films , the first and most notable being  Luis Buuel 's  Viridiana  (1961).  Robert Altman 's dark comedy  MASH  (1970) includes a sub-plot about the camp's dentist, the high point of which recreates Leonardo's tableau. The 1973 film  Jesus Christ Superstar  has Jesus and the twelve apostles, gathered in the  Garden of Gethsemane , pause at one point in the music and freeze into the tableau positions. In the 1975  Jim Sherman  film,  The Rocky Horror Picture Show , when the Criminologist is speaking just before the dinner scene his book shows The Last Supper. The 1981  Mel Brooks  film  History of the World, Part I  features Brooks as a waiter at the last supper who poses in the background as a Leonardo character is painting their portrait. The movie  Paradise Now , just before the Palestinian suicide bombers Said and Khaled leave for their ""mission"", they sit down to enjoy a ""last supper"". Said, Khaled and 11 other recruits sit facing the camera, similar to Leonardo's last supper. There are 13 people in the scene though, with no one exactly in the centre (where Jesus would be), possibly to avoid offending both Christians and Muslims, who see Jesus as a prophet of Allah, and portrayal of any of Islam's prophets is forbidden. In early 2008, the producers of  Battlestar Galactica  used the  Last Supper  to create a picture to introduce the 2009 season.

Leonardo da Vinci painted this scene in the 15th Century in Milan at the request of his patron, the Duke Ludovico Sfroza and the Duchess Beatrice dste.     This painting can be found in the refractory of the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan. Measuring 15 feet by 29 feet, this painting took several years to complete. Leonardo da Vinci began the painting in 1495 and finished it in 1498.     The painting depicts the Sfroza coat of arms in the arches above the ceiling of the refractory. It shows Jesus sitting at a table with all this twelve apostles having what is known as the ast Supperbefore Jesus was crucified. It was at this meal, that Jesus had in fact announced to his apostles that one of them would betray him. The painting shows the reactions of all his apostles right after this announcement. Right from shock to wanting clarification, all of the apostles are either looking at each other or at Jesus.    This painting also showed all the disciples seated in such a manner as to face the audience. Prior depictions of this tableau had shown Judas sitting with his back to the audience. Also, Leonardo da Vinci does not show haloes around Jesus and his apostles, contrary to popular depictions of that period. In short, Leonardo da Vinci sought to humanize the characters from the scene by showing their reactions and emotions and showing them without any haloes.    Leonardo da Vinci was experimenting with a different style of painting. The way or the method in which this painting was made, clarifies that this is a mural and not a fresco. Instead of painting on wet plaster (which is a feature of a fresco), this painting is made on dry plaster. There were several limitations while painting a fresco and Leonardo da Vinci wanted to have more freedom to experiment. He used a mixture of tempera (egg yolks and vinegar) and oil paint. He then sealed the stone wall with pitch to seal the layer of tempera.    It is because of these particular materials used in the painting, that the painting has not been able to sustain the vagaries of time. Layers of paint began to chip off. Ravages of time and the subsequent efforts of several painters and historians to restore the painting to its former glory rather rendered the painting beauty marred. However, in the most recent times, a body of experts spent over 21 years in restoring the painting. They used many modern techniques to restore the painting, such as infrared reflectoscopy and conversion of the entire building into a climate controlled environment. The restoration work was completed in 1999.     This painting of The Last Supper recently became the focus of a very interesting debate due to Dan Brown famous book called the a Vinci Code The book said that the figure seated to the right of Jesus was actually Mary Magdalene. Critics stated that if this is so, then one of the twelve apostles was missing from the picture.

It represents the scene of  The Last Supper  from the final days of  Jesus  as narrated in the  Gospel of John  13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve Apostles  would betray him.

The theme was a traditional one for  refectories , but Leonardo's interpretation gave it much greater realism and depth. The  lunettes  above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with  Sforza   coats-of-arms . The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the  Crucifixion  fresco by  Giovanni Donato da Montorfano , to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera. (These figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has  The Last Supper .) Leonardo began work on  The Last Supper  in 1495 and completed it in 1498however, he did not work on the piece continuously throughout this period. This beginning date is not certain, as ""the archives of the convent have been destroyed and our meagre documents date from 1497 when the painting was nearly finished."" [ 1 ]   The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock. From left to right:     Bartholomew ,  James, son of Alphaeus  and  Andrew  form a group of three, all are surprised.   Judas Iscariot ,  Peter  and  John  form another group of three. Judas is wearing green and blue and is in shadow, looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role within the 12 disciples as treasurer. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table; traditionally a sign of bad manners. Peter looks angry and is holding a knife pointed away from Christ, perhaps foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during Jesus' arrest. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon.   ( Jesus )   Thomas ,  James the Greater  and  Philip  are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.   Matthew ,  Jude Thaddeus  and  Simon the Zealot  are the final group of three. Both Jude Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.     These names are all agreed upon by art historians. In the 19th century, a  manuscript  ( The Notebooks Leonardo Da Vinci  pg. 232) was found with their names; before this only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus were positively identified.   In common with other depictions of The Last Supper from this period, Leonardo adopts the convention of seating the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them have their backs to the viewer. However, most previous depictions had typically excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus. Another technique commonly used was placing halos around all the disciples except Judas. Leonardo creates a more dramatic and realistic effect by having Judas lean back into shadow. He also creates a realistic and psychologically engaging means to explain why Judas takes the bread at the same time as Jesus, just after Jesus has predicted that this is what his betrayer will do. Jesus is shown saying this to Saints Thomas and James to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread, as, unseen by him, Jesus too stretches out with his right hand towards it. (Matthew 26: 17-46). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose head is located at the  vanishing point  for all perspective lines.   The painting contains several references to the number 3, which may be an allusion to the  Holy Trinity . The Apostles are seated in groupings of three; there are three windows behind Jesus; and the shape of Jesus' figure resembles a  triangle . There may have been other references that have since been lost to the painting's deterioration.     [ edit ]   Medium   Leonardo painted  The Last Supper  on a dry wall rather than on wet  plaster , so it is not a true  fresco . Because a fresco cannot be modified as the artist works, Leonardo instead chose to seal the stone wall with a layer of  pitch ,  gesso  and  mastic , then paint onto the sealing layer with  tempera . Because of the method used, the piece has not withstood time very well  within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Two early copies of  The Last Supper  are known to exist, presumably the work of Leonardo's assistant. The copies are almost the size of the original, and have survived with a wealth of original detail still intact. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Damage and restorations   As early as 1517 the painting was starting to flake. By 1556less than sixty years after it was finished  Leonardo's  biographer   Giorgio Vasari  described the painting as already ""ruined"" and so deteriorated that the figures were unrecognizable. In 1652 a doorway was cut through the (then unrecognisable) painting, and later bricked up; this can still be seen as the irregular  arch  shaped structure near the center base of the painting. It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768 a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.   A first restoration was attempted in 1726 by Michelangelo Bellotti, who filled in missing sections with  oil paint  then  varnished  the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by  Giuseppe Mazza . Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796  French   troops  used the refectory as an  armory ; they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. The refectory was then later used as a  prison ; it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821  Stefano Barezzi , an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the centre section before realising that Leonardo's work was not a  fresco . Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with  glue . From 1901 to 1908,  Luigi Cavenaghi  first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924  Oreste Silvestri  did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with  stucco .   During  World War II , on  August 15 ,  1943 , the refectory was struck by a  bomb ; protective  sandbagging  prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters, but it may have been damaged further by the  vibration . From 1951 to 1954 another clean-and-stabilise restoration was undertaken by Mauro Pelliccioli.     [ edit ]   Major restoration          The painting as it looked in the 1970s       The painting's appearance in the late 1970s was badly deteriorated and unrecognizable. From 1978 to 1999  Pinin Brambilla Barcilon  guided a major restoration project which undertook to permanently stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt, pollution, and the misguided 18th and 19th century restoration attempts. Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed,  climate controlled  environment, which meant bricking up the windows. Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially  infrared   reflectoscopy  and microscopic core-samples), and original  cartoons  preserved in the Royal Library at  Windsor Castle . Some areas were deemed unrestorable. These were re-painted with  watercolour  in subdued colours intended to indicate they were not original work, whilst not being too distracting.   This restoration took 21 years and on  May 28 ,  1999  the painting was put back on display, although intending visitors are required to book ahead and can only stay for 15 minutes. When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colours, tones, and even some facial shapes.  James Beck ,  professor  of  art history  at  Columbia University  and founder of  ArtWatch International , had been a particularly strong critic.     [ edit ]   Rumours and alternative theories   A common rumour surrounding the painting is that the same model was used for both Jesus and Judas. The story often goes that the innocent-looking young man, a baker, posed at nineteen for Jesus. Some years later Leonardo discovered a hard-bitten criminal as the model for Judas, not realizing he was the same man. There is no evidence that Leonardo used the same model for both figures and the story usually overestimates the time it took Leonardo to finish the mural. [ 3 ]   Some writers identify the person to Jesus' right not with the Apostle John (as is supposed by icongraphical tradition and confirmed by art historians) but with  Mary Magdalene . This theory was the topic of the book  The Templar Revelation , and plays a central role in  Dan Brown 's novel  The Da Vinci Code  (2003).   Critics of these theories will point out that:          Castagno's version of  The Last Supper , depicting St. John sleeping         Leonardo was requested to paint the Last Supper, which naturally included Jesus and his Twelve Apostles. As there are only thirteen figures in the painting, an apostle would have been missing to make way for Mary Magdalene. Somebody would have noted a missing male apostle earlier. Some have suggested that on the front of the figure of  Simon Peter  there is one hand with a dagger which is associated to nobody in the picture, but in  clearer reproductions  this is seen to be Peter's right hand, resting against his hip with the palm turned outward; the knife points towards  Bartholomew  (far left) who was to be executed by being  flayed . It may also indicate Peter's impulsive nature, as he cuts off a soldier's ear in John 18:10. A detailed preliminary drawing of the arm exists. [ 4 ]   The figure in question is wearing male clothing.   Some of the painting's cartoons (preliminary sketches) are preserved, and none show female faces.   Other paintings from that period ( Castagno's  1447 and  Ghirlandaio 's 1480) also show John to be a very boyish or feminine looking figure with long fair hair. [ 5 ]  This was because John was supposed to have been the youngest and most unquestioningly devoted of the apostles. Hence he is often shown asleep against Jesus's shoulder. It was common in the period to show neophytes as very young or even feminine figures, as a way of showing their inferior position.   Leonardo also portrayed a male saint with similar effeminate features in his painting  St. John the Baptist .     There have also been other popular speculations about the work:     It has been suggested that there is no cup in the painting, yet Jesus' left hand is pointing to the  Eucharist  and his right to a glass of wine. (There are several glasses on the table, but they are difficult to see owing to the work's deterioration and restorations.) This is not the glorified chalice of legend as Leonardo insisted on realistic paintings. He often criticised  Michelangelo  for painting muscular, superhuman figures in the  Sistine Chapel .   It is claimed that if one looks above the figure of Bartholemew, a Grail-like image appears on the wall. Whether Leonardo meant this to be a representation of the  Holy Grail  cannot be known, since as pointed out earlier there is a glass on the table within Christ's reach. The ""Grail image"" has become noticed probably because it only appears when viewing the painting in small scale reproductions.  Zooming in  on the painting reveals a cluster of geometrical shapes, possibly intended to represent marble wall decoration, or more likely, paneling on a door. [ 6 ]  They only appear to form a golden chalice when parts are deliberately occluded.            Leonardo da Vinci's  The Last Supper  superimposed with its mirror image       Slavisa Pesci, ""an information technologist and amateur scholar"",  superimposed  Leonardo da Vinci's version of  The Last Supper  with its mirror image (with both images of Jesus lined up) and claimed [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  that the resultant picture has:     a Templar knight on the far left   a woman in orange holds a swaddled baby in arms to the left of Christ   the Holy Grail used in the first Eucharist     Giovanni Maria Pala, an Italian musician, has indicated that the positions of hands and loaves of bread can be interpreted as notes on a musical staff, and if read from right to left, as was characteristic of Da Vinci's writing, form a  musical composition . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   The Last Supper in culture     [ edit ]   Painting, mosaic and photography   A fine 16th century oil on canvas copy is conserved in the abbey of  Tongerlo ,  Antwerp ,  Belgium . It reveals many details that are no longer visible on the original. [ 11 ]  The  Roman   mosaic  artist  Giacomo Raffaelli  made another life-sized copy (1809-1814) in the  Viennese   Minoritenkirche .   In 1955, the renowned artist  Salvador Dali  painted  The Sacrament of the Last Supper , with Jesus portrayed as blonde and clean shaven, pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified. It has been generally considered a masterpiece, and is reputed to be one of the most popular paintings in the collection of the  National Gallery of Art  in  Washington, D.C.   In more recent times, the painting has also been much imitated and parodied in art and photography. Mary Beth Edelson's ""Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper"" (1971) reproduced the composition with  Georgia O'Keeffe  in the central position. Likewise,  Yo Mama's Last Supper , a controversial work of art by  Rene Cox , was a montage of five photographs of twelve black men and a naked black woman (the artist's self portrait) posed in imitation of Leonardo's painting. Cox is pictured naked and standing, with her arms reaching upwards, as Jesus. The piece is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and received acclaim and criticism in heavy measure, the latter notably by former mayor of New York City,  Rudy Giuliani .     [ edit ]   Modern art           The Last Supper  made in salt in  Wieliczka Salt Mine  ( Poland )       In 1988, modern artist  Vik Muniz  famously displayed a recreation of The Last Supper, made entirely out of  Bosco Chocolate Syrup . [ 12 ]   In 2007, Pennsylvania artist Mark Beekman created the world's largest  Lite-Brite  of  The Last Supper , breaking the record held by the previous Guinness record holder for largest Lite-Brite object. As of December 2007, the object was being auctioned on eBay. [ citation needed ]   On  30 July   2008  ""The Last Supper"" was the subject of an animation by British film-maker,  Peter Greenaway , who projected interpretative images onto its surface to bring the scene to life. [ 13 ]  His plans to do so had faced criticism and concerns that it would damage the work, [ 14 ]  but eventually went ahead when the proviso was given that the show would only occur once. He plans to replicate it in a more permanent form onto a full-size reproduction of the painting in a British gallery, and to carry out similar shows on  Las Meninas  by  Velzquez ,  Picasso 's  Guernica , Monet's Waterlilies, a  Jackson Pollock  painting in New York and Michelangelo's  Last Judgment  in the  Sistine Chapel .

(October 2008)               Mel Brooks 's parody of  The Last Supper  from  History of the World, Part 1       The painting has been  parodied  in several  films , the first and most notable being  Luis Buuel 's  Viridiana  (1961).  Robert Altman 's dark comedy  MASH  (1970) includes a sub-plot about the camp's dentist, the high point of which recreates Leonardo's tableau. The 1973 film  Jesus Christ Superstar  has Jesus and the twelve apostles, gathered in the  Garden of Gethsemane , pause at one point in the music and freeze into the tableau positions. In the 1975  Jim Sherman  film,  The Rocky Horror Picture Show , when the Criminologist is speaking just before the dinner scene his book shows The Last Supper. The 1981  Mel Brooks  film  History of the World, Part I  features Brooks as a waiter at the last supper who poses in the background as a Leonardo character is painting their portrait. The movie  Paradise Now , just before the Palestinian suicide bombers Said and Khaled leave for their ""mission"", they sit down to enjoy a ""last supper"". Said, Khaled and 11 other recruits sit facing the camera, similar to Leonardo's last supper. There are 13 people in the scene though, with no one exactly in the centre (where Jesus would be), possibly to avoid offending both Christians and Muslims, who see Jesus as a prophet of Allah, and portrayal of any of Islam's prophets is forbidden. In early 2008, the producers of  Battlestar Galactica  used the  Last Supper  to create a picture to introduce the 2009 season. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Leo Perutz ' novel  Leonardo's Judas  concerns the artist's search for a model for the face of Judas Iscariot.

It represents the scene of  The Last Supper  from the final days of  Jesus  as narrated in the  Gospel of John  13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve Apostles  would betray him.

The theme was a traditional one for  refectories , but Leonardo's interpretation gave it much greater realism and depth. The  lunettes  above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with  Sforza   coats-of-arms . The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the  Crucifixion  fresco by  Giovanni Donato da Montorfano , to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera. (These figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has  The Last Supper .) Leonardo began work on  The Last Supper  in 1495 and completed it in 1498however, he did not work on the piece continuously throughout this period. This beginning date is not certain, as ""the archives of the convent have been destroyed and our meagre documents date from 1497 when the painting was nearly finished."" [ 1 ]   The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock. From left to right:     Bartholomew ,  James, son of Alphaeus  and  Andrew  form a group of three, all are surprised.   Judas Iscariot ,  Peter  and  John  form another group of three. Judas is wearing green and blue and is in shadow, looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role within the 12 disciples as treasurer. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table; traditionally a sign of bad manners. Peter looks angry and is holding a knife pointed away from Christ, perhaps foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during Jesus' arrest. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon.   ( Jesus )   Thomas ,  James the Greater  and  Philip  are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.   Matthew ,  Jude Thaddeus  and  Simon the Zealot  are the final group of three. Both Jude Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.     These names are all agreed upon by art historians. In the 19th century, a  manuscript  ( The Notebooks Leonardo Da Vinci  pg. 232) was found with their names; before this only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus were positively identified.   In common with other depictions of The Last Supper from this period, Leonardo adopts the convention of seating the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them have their backs to the viewer. However, most previous depictions had typically excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus. Another technique commonly used was placing halos around all the disciples except Judas. Leonardo creates a more dramatic and realistic effect by having Judas lean back into shadow. He also creates a realistic and psychologically engaging means to explain why Judas takes the bread at the same time as Jesus, just after Jesus has predicted that this is what his betrayer will do. Jesus is shown saying this to Saints Thomas and James to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread, as, unseen by him, Jesus too stretches out with his right hand towards it. (Matthew 26: 17-46). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose head is located at the  vanishing point  for all perspective lines.   The painting contains several references to the number 3, which may be an allusion to the  Holy Trinity . The Apostles are seated in groupings of three; there are three windows behind Jesus; and the shape of Jesus' figure resembles a  triangle . There may have been other references that have since been lost to the painting's deterioration.     [ edit ]   Medium   Leonardo painted  The Last Supper  on a dry wall rather than on wet  plaster , so it is not a true  fresco . Because a fresco cannot be modified as the artist works, Leonardo instead chose to seal the stone wall with a layer of  pitch ,  gesso  and  mastic , then paint onto the sealing layer with  tempera . Because of the method used, the piece has not withstood time very well  within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Two early copies of  The Last Supper  are known to exist, presumably the work of Leonardo's assistant. The copies are almost the size of the original, and have survived with a wealth of original detail still intact. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Damage and restorations   As early as 1517 the painting was starting to flake. By 1556less than sixty years after it was finished  Leonardo's  biographer   Giorgio Vasari  described the painting as already ""ruined"" and so deteriorated that the figures were unrecognizable. In 1652 a doorway was cut through the (then unrecognisable) painting, and later bricked up; this can still be seen as the irregular  arch  shaped structure near the center base of the painting. It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768 a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.   A first restoration was attempted in 1726 by Michelangelo Bellotti, who filled in missing sections with  oil paint  then  varnished  the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by  Giuseppe Mazza . Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796  French   troops  used the refectory as an  armory ; they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. The refectory was then later used as a  prison ; it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821  Stefano Barezzi , an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the centre section before realising that Leonardo's work was not a  fresco . Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with  glue . From 1901 to 1908,  Luigi Cavenaghi  first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924  Oreste Silvestri  did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with  stucco .   During  World War II , on  August 15 ,  1943 , the refectory was struck by a  bomb ; protective  sandbagging  prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters, but it may have been damaged further by the  vibration . From 1951 to 1954 another clean-and-stabilise restoration was undertaken by Mauro Pelliccioli.     [ edit ]   Major restoration          The painting as it looked in the 1970s       The painting's appearance in the late 1970s was badly deteriorated and unrecognizable. From 1978 to 1999  Pinin Brambilla Barcilon  guided a major restoration project which undertook to permanently stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt, pollution, and the misguided 18th and 19th century restoration attempts. Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed,  climate controlled  environment, which meant bricking up the windows. Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially  infrared   reflectoscopy  and microscopic core-samples), and original  cartoons  preserved in the Royal Library at  Windsor Castle . Some areas were deemed unrestorable. These were re-painted with  watercolour  in subdued colours intended to indicate they were not original work, whilst not being too distracting.   This restoration took 21 years and on  May 28 ,  1999  the painting was put back on display, although intending visitors are required to book ahead and can only stay for 15 minutes. When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colours, tones, and even some facial shapes.  James Beck ,  professor  of  art history  at  Columbia University  and founder of  ArtWatch International , had been a particularly strong critic.     [ edit ]   Rumours and alternative theories   A common rumour surrounding the painting is that the same model was used for both Jesus and Judas. The story often goes that the innocent-looking young man, a baker, posed at nineteen for Jesus. Some years later Leonardo discovered a hard-bitten criminal as the model for Judas, not realizing he was the same man. There is no evidence that Leonardo used the same model for both figures and the story usually overestimates the time it took Leonardo to finish the mural. [ 3 ]   Some writers identify the person to Jesus' right not with the Apostle John (as is supposed by icongraphical tradition and confirmed by art historians) but with  Mary Magdalene . This theory was the topic of the book  The Templar Revelation , and plays a central role in  Dan Brown 's novel  The Da Vinci Code  (2003).   Critics of these theories will point out that:          Castagno's version of  The Last Supper , depicting St. John sleeping         Leonardo was requested to paint the Last Supper, which naturally included Jesus and his Twelve Apostles. As there are only thirteen figures in the painting, an apostle would have been missing to make way for Mary Magdalene. Somebody would have noted a missing male apostle earlier. Some have suggested that on the front of the figure of  Simon Peter  there is one hand with a dagger which is associated to nobody in the picture, but in  clearer reproductions  this is seen to be Peter's right hand, resting against his hip with the palm turned outward; the knife points towards  Bartholomew  (far left) who was to be executed by being  flayed . It may also indicate Peter's impulsive nature, as he cuts off a soldier's ear in John 18:10. A detailed preliminary drawing of the arm exists. [ 4 ]   The figure in question is wearing male clothing.   Some of the painting's cartoons (preliminary sketches) are preserved, and none show female faces.   Other paintings from that period ( Castagno's  1447 and  Ghirlandaio 's 1480) also show John to be a very boyish or feminine looking figure with long fair hair. [ 5 ]  This was because John was supposed to have been the youngest and most unquestioningly devoted of the apostles. Hence he is often shown asleep against Jesus's shoulder. It was common in the period to show neophytes as very young or even feminine figures, as a way of showing their inferior position.   Leonardo also portrayed a male saint with similar effeminate features in his painting  St. John the Baptist .     There have also been other popular speculations about the work:     It has been suggested that there is no cup in the painting, yet Jesus' left hand is pointing to the  Eucharist  and his right to a glass of wine. (There are several glasses on the table, but they are difficult to see owing to the work's deterioration and restorations.) This is not the glorified chalice of legend as Leonardo insisted on realistic paintings. He often criticised  Michelangelo  for painting muscular, superhuman figures in the  Sistine Chapel .   It is claimed that if one looks above the figure of Bartholemew, a Grail-like image appears on the wall. Whether Leonardo meant this to be a representation of the  Holy Grail  cannot be known, since as pointed out earlier there is a glass on the table within Christ's reach. The ""Grail image"" has become noticed probably because it only appears when viewing the painting in small scale reproductions.  Zooming in  on the painting reveals a cluster of geometrical shapes, possibly intended to represent marble wall decoration, or more likely, paneling on a door. [ 6 ]  They only appear to form a golden chalice when parts are deliberately occluded.            Leonardo da Vinci's  The Last Supper  superimposed with its mirror image       Slavisa Pesci, ""an information technologist and amateur scholar"",  superimposed  Leonardo da Vinci's version of  The Last Supper  with its mirror image (with both images of Jesus lined up) and claimed [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  that the resultant picture has:     a Templar knight on the far left   a woman in orange holds a swaddled baby in arms to the left of Christ   the Holy Grail used in the first Eucharist     Giovanni Maria Pala, an Italian musician, has indicated that the positions of hands and loaves of bread can be interpreted as notes on a musical staff, and if read from right to left, as was characteristic of Da Vinci's writing, form a  musical composition . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   The Last Supper in culture     [ edit ]   Painting, mosaic and photography   A fine 16th century oil on canvas copy is conserved in the abbey of  Tongerlo ,  Antwerp ,  Belgium . It reveals many details that are no longer visible on the original. [ 11 ]  The  Roman   mosaic  artist  Giacomo Raffaelli  made another life-sized copy (1809-1814) in the  Viennese   Minoritenkirche .   In 1955, the renowned artist  Salvador Dali  painted  The Sacrament of the Last Supper , with Jesus portrayed as blonde and clean shaven, pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified. It has been generally considered a masterpiece, and is reputed to be one of the most popular paintings in the collection of the  National Gallery of Art  in  Washington, D.C.   In more recent times, the painting has also been much imitated and parodied in art and photography. Mary Beth Edelson's ""Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper"" (1971) reproduced the composition with  Georgia O'Keeffe  in the central position. Likewise,  Yo Mama's Last Supper , a controversial work of art by  Rene Cox , was a montage of five photographs of twelve black men and a naked black woman (the artist's self portrait) posed in imitation of Leonardo's painting. Cox is pictured naked and standing, with her arms reaching upwards, as Jesus. The piece is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and received acclaim and criticism in heavy measure, the latter notably by former mayor of New York City,  Rudy Giuliani .     [ edit ]   Modern art           The Last Supper  made in salt in  Wieliczka Salt Mine  ( Poland )       In 1988, modern artist  Vik Muniz  famously displayed a recreation of The Last Supper, made entirely out of  Bosco Chocolate Syrup . [ 12 ]   In 2007, Pennsylvania artist Mark Beekman created the world's largest  Lite-Brite  of  The Last Supper , breaking the record held by the previous Guinness record holder for largest Lite-Brite object. As of December 2007, the object was being auctioned on eBay. [ citation needed ]   On  30 July   2008  ""The Last Supper"" was the subject of an animation by British film-maker,  Peter Greenaway , who projected interpretative images onto its surface to bring the scene to life. [ 13 ]  His plans to do so had faced criticism and concerns that it would damage the work, [ 14 ]  but eventually went ahead when the proviso was given that the show would only occur once. He plans to replicate it in a more permanent form onto a full-size reproduction of the painting in a British gallery, and to carry out similar shows on  Las Meninas  by  Velzquez ,  Picasso 's  Guernica , Monet's Waterlilies, a  Jackson Pollock  painting in New York and Michelangelo's  Last Judgment  in the  Sistine Chapel .

(October 2008)               Mel Brooks 's parody of  The Last Supper  from  History of the World, Part 1       The painting has been  parodied  in several  films , the first and most notable being  Luis Buuel 's  Viridiana  (1961).  Robert Altman 's dark comedy  MASH  (1970) includes a sub-plot about the camp's dentist, the high point of which recreates Leonardo's tableau. The 1973 film  Jesus Christ Superstar  has Jesus and the twelve apostles, gathered in the  Garden of Gethsemane , pause at one point in the music and freeze into the tableau positions. In the 1975  Jim Sherman  film,  The Rocky Horror Picture Show , when the Criminologist is speaking just before the dinner scene his book shows The Last Supper. The 1981  Mel Brooks  film  History of the World, Part I  features Brooks as a waiter at the last supper who poses in the background as a Leonardo character is painting their portrait. The movie  Paradise Now , just before the Palestinian suicide bombers Said and Khaled leave for their ""mission"", they sit down to enjoy a ""last supper"". Said, Khaled and 11 other recruits sit facing the camera, similar to Leonardo's last supper. There are 13 people in the scene though, with no one exactly in the centre (where Jesus would be), possibly to avoid offending both Christians and Muslims, who see Jesus as a prophet of Allah, and portrayal of any of Islam's prophets is forbidden. In early 2008, the producers of  Battlestar Galactica  used the  Last Supper  to create a picture to introduce the 2009 season. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Leo Perutz ' novel  Leonardo's Judas  concerns the artist's search for a model for the face of Judas Iscariot.

It represents the scene of  The Last Supper  from the final days of  Jesus  as narrated in the  Gospel of John  13:21, when Jesus announces that one of his  Twelve Apostles  would betray him.

The theme was a traditional one for  refectories , but Leonardo's interpretation gave it much greater realism and depth. The  lunettes  above the main painting, formed by the triple arched ceiling of the refectory, are painted with  Sforza   coats-of-arms . The opposite wall of the refectory is covered by the  Crucifixion  fresco by  Giovanni Donato da Montorfano , to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera. (These figures have deteriorated in much the same way as has  The Last Supper .) Leonardo began work on  The Last Supper  in 1495 and completed it in 1498however, he did not work on the piece continuously throughout this period. This beginning date is not certain, as ""the archives of the convent have been destroyed and our meagre documents date from 1497 when the painting was nearly finished."" [ 1 ]   The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock. From left to right:     Bartholomew ,  James, son of Alphaeus  and  Andrew  form a group of three, all are surprised.   Judas Iscariot ,  Peter  and  John  form another group of three. Judas is wearing green and blue and is in shadow, looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role within the 12 disciples as treasurer. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table; traditionally a sign of bad manners. Peter looks angry and is holding a knife pointed away from Christ, perhaps foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during Jesus' arrest. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon.   ( Jesus )   Thomas ,  James the Greater  and  Philip  are the next group of three. Thomas is clearly upset; James the Greater looks stunned, with his arms in the air. Meanwhile, Philip appears to be requesting some explanation.   Matthew ,  Jude Thaddeus  and  Simon the Zealot  are the final group of three. Both Jude Thaddeus and Matthew are turned toward Simon, perhaps to find out if he has any answer to their initial questions.     These names are all agreed upon by art historians. In the 19th century, a  manuscript  ( The Notebooks Leonardo Da Vinci  pg. 232) was found with their names; before this only Judas, Peter, John and Jesus were positively identified.   In common with other depictions of The Last Supper from this period, Leonardo adopts the convention of seating the diners on one side of the table, so that none of them have their backs to the viewer. However, most previous depictions had typically excluded Judas by placing him alone on the opposite side of the table from the other eleven disciples and Jesus. Another technique commonly used was placing halos around all the disciples except Judas. Leonardo creates a more dramatic and realistic effect by having Judas lean back into shadow. He also creates a realistic and psychologically engaging means to explain why Judas takes the bread at the same time as Jesus, just after Jesus has predicted that this is what his betrayer will do. Jesus is shown saying this to Saints Thomas and James to his left, who react in horror as Jesus points with his left hand to a piece of bread before them. Distracted by the conversation between John and Peter, Judas reaches for a different piece of bread, as, unseen by him, Jesus too stretches out with his right hand towards it. (Matthew 26: 17-46). The angles and lighting draw attention to Jesus, whose head is located at the  vanishing point  for all perspective lines.   The painting contains several references to the number 3, which may be an allusion to the  Holy Trinity . The Apostles are seated in groupings of three; there are three windows behind Jesus; and the shape of Jesus' figure resembles a  triangle . There may have been other references that have since been lost to the painting's deterioration.     [ edit ]   Medium   Leonardo painted  The Last Supper  on a dry wall rather than on wet  plaster , so it is not a true  fresco . Because a fresco cannot be modified as the artist works, Leonardo instead chose to seal the stone wall with a layer of  pitch ,  gesso  and  mastic , then paint onto the sealing layer with  tempera . Because of the method used, the piece has not withstood time very well  within a few years of completion it had already begun showing signs of deterioration.   Two early copies of  The Last Supper  are known to exist, presumably the work of Leonardo's assistant. The copies are almost the size of the original, and have survived with a wealth of original detail still intact. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Damage and restorations   As early as 1517 the painting was starting to flake. By 1556less than sixty years after it was finished  Leonardo's  biographer   Giorgio Vasari  described the painting as already ""ruined"" and so deteriorated that the figures were unrecognizable. In 1652 a doorway was cut through the (then unrecognisable) painting, and later bricked up; this can still be seen as the irregular  arch  shaped structure near the center base of the painting. It is believed, through early copies, that Jesus' feet were in a position symbolizing the forthcoming crucifixion. In 1768 a curtain was hung over the painting for the purpose of protection; it instead trapped moisture on the surface, and whenever the curtain was pulled back, it scratched the flaking paint.   A first restoration was attempted in 1726 by Michelangelo Bellotti, who filled in missing sections with  oil paint  then  varnished  the whole mural. This repair did not last well and another restoration was attempted in 1770 by  Giuseppe Mazza . Mazza stripped off Bellotti's work then largely repainted the painting; he had redone all but three faces when he was halted due to public outrage. In 1796  French   troops  used the refectory as an  armory ; they threw stones at the painting and climbed ladders to scratch out the Apostles' eyes. The refectory was then later used as a  prison ; it is not known if any of the prisoners may have damaged the painting. In 1821  Stefano Barezzi , an expert in removing whole frescoes from their walls intact, was called in to remove the painting to a safer location; he badly damaged the centre section before realising that Leonardo's work was not a  fresco . Barezzi then attempted to reattach damaged sections with  glue . From 1901 to 1908,  Luigi Cavenaghi  first completed a careful study of the structure of the painting, then began cleaning it. In 1924  Oreste Silvestri  did further cleaning, and stabilised some parts with  stucco .   During  World War II , on  August 15 ,  1943 , the refectory was struck by a  bomb ; protective  sandbagging  prevented the painting from being struck by bomb splinters, but it may have been damaged further by the  vibration . From 1951 to 1954 another clean-and-stabilise restoration was undertaken by Mauro Pelliccioli.     [ edit ]   Major restoration          The painting as it looked in the 1970s       The painting's appearance in the late 1970s was badly deteriorated and unrecognizable. From 1978 to 1999  Pinin Brambilla Barcilon  guided a major restoration project which undertook to permanently stabilize the painting, and reverse the damage caused by dirt, pollution, and the misguided 18th and 19th century restoration attempts. Since it had proved impractical to move the painting to a more controlled environment, the refectory was instead converted to a sealed,  climate controlled  environment, which meant bricking up the windows. Then, detailed study was undertaken to determine the painting's original form, using scientific tests (especially  infrared   reflectoscopy  and microscopic core-samples), and original  cartoons  preserved in the Royal Library at  Windsor Castle . Some areas were deemed unrestorable. These were re-painted with  watercolour  in subdued colours intended to indicate they were not original work, whilst not being too distracting.   This restoration took 21 years and on  May 28 ,  1999  the painting was put back on display, although intending visitors are required to book ahead and can only stay for 15 minutes. When it was unveiled, considerable controversy was aroused by the dramatic changes in colours, tones, and even some facial shapes.  James Beck ,  professor  of  art history  at  Columbia University  and founder of  ArtWatch International , had been a particularly strong critic.     [ edit ]   Rumours and alternative theories   A common rumour surrounding the painting is that the same model was used for both Jesus and Judas. The story often goes that the innocent-looking young man, a baker, posed at nineteen for Jesus. Some years later Leonardo discovered a hard-bitten criminal as the model for Judas, not realizing he was the same man. There is no evidence that Leonardo used the same model for both figures and the story usually overestimates the time it took Leonardo to finish the mural. [ 3 ]   Some writers identify the person to Jesus' right not with the Apostle John (as is supposed by icongraphical tradition and confirmed by art historians) but with  Mary Magdalene . This theory was the topic of the book  The Templar Revelation , and plays a central role in  Dan Brown 's novel  The Da Vinci Code  (2003).   Critics of these theories will point out that:          Castagno's version of  The Last Supper , depicting St. John sleeping         Leonardo was requested to paint the Last Supper, which naturally included Jesus and his Twelve Apostles. As there are only thirteen figures in the painting, an apostle would have been missing to make way for Mary Magdalene. Somebody would have noted a missing male apostle earlier. Some have suggested that on the front of the figure of  Simon Peter  there is one hand with a dagger which is associated to nobody in the picture, but in  clearer reproductions  this is seen to be Peter's right hand, resting against his hip with the palm turned outward; the knife points towards  Bartholomew  (far left) who was to be executed by being  flayed . It may also indicate Peter's impulsive nature, as he cuts off a soldier's ear in John 18:10. A detailed preliminary drawing of the arm exists. [ 4 ]   The figure in question is wearing male clothing.   Some of the painting's cartoons (preliminary sketches) are preserved, and none show female faces.   Other paintings from that period ( Castagno's  1447 and  Ghirlandaio 's 1480) also show John to be a very boyish or feminine looking figure with long fair hair. [ 5 ]  This was because John was supposed to have been the youngest and most unquestioningly devoted of the apostles. Hence he is often shown asleep against Jesus's shoulder. It was common in the period to show neophytes as very young or even feminine figures, as a way of showing their inferior position.   Leonardo also portrayed a male saint with similar effeminate features in his painting  St. John the Baptist .     There have also been other popular speculations about the work:     It has been suggested that there is no cup in the painting, yet Jesus' left hand is pointing to the  Eucharist  and his right to a glass of wine. (There are several glasses on the table, but they are difficult to see owing to the work's deterioration and restorations.) This is not the glorified chalice of legend as Leonardo insisted on realistic paintings. He often criticised  Michelangelo  for painting muscular, superhuman figures in the  Sistine Chapel .   It is claimed that if one looks above the figure of Bartholemew, a Grail-like image appears on the wall. Whether Leonardo meant this to be a representation of the  Holy Grail  cannot be known, since as pointed out earlier there is a glass on the table within Christ's reach. The ""Grail image"" has become noticed probably because it only appears when viewing the painting in small scale reproductions.  Zooming in  on the painting reveals a cluster of geometrical shapes, possibly intended to represent marble wall decoration, or more likely, paneling on a door. [ 6 ]  They only appear to form a golden chalice when parts are deliberately occluded.            Leonardo da Vinci's  The Last Supper  superimposed with its mirror image       Slavisa Pesci, ""an information technologist and amateur scholar"",  superimposed  Leonardo da Vinci's version of  The Last Supper  with its mirror image (with both images of Jesus lined up) and claimed [ 7 ] [ 8 ]  that the resultant picture has:     a Templar knight on the far left   a woman in orange holds a swaddled baby in arms to the left of Christ   the Holy Grail used in the first Eucharist     Giovanni Maria Pala, an Italian musician, has indicated that the positions of hands and loaves of bread can be interpreted as notes on a musical staff, and if read from right to left, as was characteristic of Da Vinci's writing, form a  musical composition . [ 9 ] [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   The Last Supper in culture     [ edit ]   Painting, mosaic and photography   A fine 16th century oil on canvas copy is conserved in the abbey of  Tongerlo ,  Antwerp ,  Belgium . It reveals many details that are no longer visible on the original. [ 11 ]  The  Roman   mosaic  artist  Giacomo Raffaelli  made another life-sized copy (1809-1814) in the  Viennese   Minoritenkirche .   In 1955, the renowned artist  Salvador Dali  painted  The Sacrament of the Last Supper , with Jesus portrayed as blonde and clean shaven, pointing upward to a spectral torso while the apostles are gathered around the table heads bowed so that none may be identified. It has been generally considered a masterpiece, and is reputed to be one of the most popular paintings in the collection of the  National Gallery of Art  in  Washington, D.C.   In more recent times, the painting has also been much imitated and parodied in art and photography. Mary Beth Edelson's ""Some Living American Women Artists/Last Supper"" (1971) reproduced the composition with  Georgia O'Keeffe  in the central position. Likewise,  Yo Mama's Last Supper , a controversial work of art by  Rene Cox , was a montage of five photographs of twelve black men and a naked black woman (the artist's self portrait) posed in imitation of Leonardo's painting. Cox is pictured naked and standing, with her arms reaching upwards, as Jesus. The piece is exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and received acclaim and criticism in heavy measure, the latter notably by former mayor of New York City,  Rudy Giuliani .     [ edit ]   Modern art           The Last Supper  made in salt in  Wieliczka Salt Mine  ( Poland )       In 1988, modern artist  Vik Muniz  famously displayed a recreation of The Last Supper, made entirely out of  Bosco Chocolate Syrup . [ 12 ]   In 2007, Pennsylvania artist Mark Beekman created the world's largest  Lite-Brite  of  The Last Supper , breaking the record held by the previous Guinness record holder for largest Lite-Brite object. As of December 2007, the object was being auctioned on eBay. [ citation needed ]   On  30 July   2008  ""The Last Supper"" was the subject of an animation by British film-maker,  Peter Greenaway , who projected interpretative images onto its surface to bring the scene to life. [ 13 ]  His plans to do so had faced criticism and concerns that it would damage the work, [ 14 ]  but eventually went ahead when the proviso was given that the show would only occur once. He plans to replicate it in a more permanent form onto a full-size reproduction of the painting in a British gallery, and to carry out similar shows on  Las Meninas  by  Velzquez ,  Picasso 's  Guernica , Monet's Waterlilies, a  Jackson Pollock  painting in New York and Michelangelo's  Last Judgment  in the  Sistine Chapel .

(October 2008)               Mel Brooks 's parody of  The Last Supper  from  History of the World, Part 1       The painting has been  parodied  in several  films , the first and most notable being  Luis Buuel 's  Viridiana  (1961).  Robert Altman 's dark comedy  MASH  (1970) includes a sub-plot about the camp's dentist, the high point of which recreates Leonardo's tableau. The 1973 film  Jesus Christ Superstar  has Jesus and the twelve apostles, gathered in the  Garden of Gethsemane , pause at one point in the music and freeze into the tableau positions. In the 1975  Jim Sherman  film,  The Rocky Horror Picture Show , when the Criminologist is speaking just before the dinner scene his book shows The Last Supper. The 1981  Mel Brooks  film  History of the World, Part I  features Brooks as a waiter at the last supper who poses in the background as a Leonardo character is painting their portrait. The movie  Paradise Now , just before the Palestinian suicide bombers Said and Khaled leave for their ""mission"", they sit down to enjoy a ""last supper"". Said, Khaled and 11 other recruits sit facing the camera, similar to Leonardo's last supper. There are 13 people in the scene though, with no one exactly in the centre (where Jesus would be), possibly to avoid offending both Christians and Muslims, who see Jesus as a prophet of Allah, and portrayal of any of Islam's prophets is forbidden. In early 2008, the producers of  Battlestar Galactica  used the  Last Supper  to create a picture to introduce the 2009 season. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Literature   Leo Perutz ' novel  Leonardo's Judas  concerns the artist's search for a model for the face of Judas Iscariot.

The Last Supper - Da Vinci  - Description:      The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci was painted at a time when Da Vinci was already well known for his incredible masterpieces.  Up until this time, most last supper paintings portrayed a peaceful scene of Jesus breaking bread for his followers who sat quietly by him.    This scene by Da Vinci caused uproar because of the loud and human way that he portrayed his subjects.  The Last Supper specifically portrays the reaction given by each apostle when Jesus said one of them would betray him. All twelve apostles have different reactions to the news, with various degrees of anger and shock.  Leonardo seats the diners on one side of the table, so we can get a full glimpse of the action.  Da Vinci has Judas lean back into shadow, creating a dramatic and realistic effect.   The painting contains several references to the number 3, which may be an allusion to the Holy Trinity. The Apostles are seated in groupings of three; there are three windows behind Jesus; and the shape of Jesus' figure resembles a triangle. This work could take on an amazing life of its own with a hand painted oil reproduction of it to hang in your home.  The dining room or kitchen would be an excellent spot to portray Jesus breaking bread for the last time.  This work has elements of detail and surprise that will keep you entertained and enthralled for years to come.   The Last Supper takes only 6-8 weeks to be completed and is made using only the highest quality materials.  It comes to you unframed, so that you can choose the right frame to highlight the painting as it fits best in your home.    Bring a piece of art and history into your life today!

Adobe homes are comfortable and adaptable. Adobe homes also combine Native American and hispanic traditions with modern innovations and personal expression. Below are our choices for the finest ""coffee table"" books that deal with adobe history and homes. See also our companion piece for books on adobe building plans. 1.  The Small Adobe House Agnesa Reeve's 96-page book is a great introduction to adobe, covering its history and its use in modern construction. The information and 75 color photos will help you decide whether to build a classic adobe home or to use the material in innovative ways.  2.  Casa Adobe Authors Karen Witynski and Joe P. Carr write that ""adobe is an old tradition with a new future."" Their book takes us on a photo tour of old and new adobe homes in the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.  3.  Adobe Details Also by Karen Witynski and Joe P. Carr, ""Adobe Details"" takes a closer look inside adobe structures, providing close-up details of their walls, portales, doors, cabinets, stone-paved courtyards, nichos, and bancos. 4.  Behind Adobe Walls Author Landt Dennis and photographer Lisl Dennis explore the interior designs and furnishings more than the structures themselves. Still, this beautiful volume provides an interesting look at the adobe lifestyle.  5.  The Adobe Story: A Global Treasure Leading adobe architect and builder Paul Graham McHenry surveys the use of adobe around the world and examines Adobe's history, advantages, varieties, and mythology. We're taken on a cultural tour through New Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and the Middle East.

By  Shelley Esaak , About.com    Filed In: Artists  A to Z   >  Famous Works of Art >  Famous Paintings >  Leonardo's Last Supper >  Last Supper FAQs      The Last Supper (after cleaning), Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, Milan Scan Mark Harden, used with permission            Question:  Is that John or Mary Magdalene in the Last Supper? Answer:  (Heaven help us all - aren't there more important questions in the world? This much brain wattage should be directed toward a cure for AIDS or poverty or illiteracy. Seriously,  if you could just  see  my inbox... )   In Leonardo da Vinci's  The Last Supper ,  the figure at Jesus' right arm  does not possess an easily identified gender. He's not bald, or bearded, or anything we visually associate with ""masculine"". In fact, he looks feminine. Fine. We all can, and should, agree on this.   The Burning Question seems to be: Is this figure a woman?   My answer:  No .   Fact:  Mary Magdalene wasn't listed among those  at the table  in any of the four Gospels.   Yes, she was present during the Last Supper, according to Biblical accounts. Her role, however, was a minor supporting one. She wiped feet.   In terms of this fresco, it doesn't matter if she was ""written out"" of being at the table. *If* she was omitted (on purpose or otherwise) it doesn't matter when or by whom. For whatever reason, the fact is she wasn't among the Thirteen Who Supped according to Gospel accounts - which were the only basis upon which an artist could compose a visual work of the Last Supper in an historical context,  at that time . (All of the eyewitnesses are long dead, folks.)   Fact:  Leonardo wasn't stupid.   If you think people get testy over sacrilegious paintings now, a little (theoretical) time-travel back to the late 15th-century would be truly enlightening in terms of how  un casually the Catholic Church took matters of heresy  then .   Leonardo may have been one to ""stir the pot"", every now and then - you know, shake things up a bit, try to get people to think, etc. I suspect he had a sense of humor and may have liked a good joke. But I'd also bet money the very  last  place he fancied himself was locked up in some dungeon with an angry Pope deciding his fate. As previously stated, Leonardo, the man, was not stupid.   Fact:  Cross-dressing wasn't invented by J. Edgar Hoover.   Enough said.   Fact:   The Da Vinci Code , while  an entertaining read , is fiction.   Go to the library and look for yourself, if you don't believe me. There's a big old ""F"" on the spine, right there above the word ""Brown"". (Do not contact me to inquire what the ""F"" stands for, I beg of you, unless you crave a lecture on the Dewey decimal system and its importance to civilization.)   If  The Da Vinci Code  makes you ponder things previously unpondered, great. If it sparks healthy debate, fabulous. If it's causing you to verbally fight with other people over religion, please refer to that ""F"", realize its logical place in the order of the universe and  snap out of it.   Fact:  Leonardo was  not  working from a Polaroid of the actual Last Supper. There is such a thing as  artistic license .   Unless one works in photography or Photorealism (and, probably, even then), an artist's personality is going to creep into his or her work. An artist can't help but inject his or her psyche into a creation. No matter which piece you are looking at, you are also looking at a portion of an artist's being.   In viewing  The Last Supper , we get a glimpse of what was going on in Leonardo's mind's-eye as he painted it. If he meant for a deeper, hidden meaning to be painted within the fresco, he didn't tell us. It is not necessary to pick apart the psychological make-up of the artist. You either like the work or you don't. Just try to keep in mind that it's a picture, created by a  human being  who was, however insanely gifted, not old enough to have attended the actual Event.   Additionally, if we really  must  get all nit-picky, it bothers me that no one ever writes to ask why Michelangelo created all of those masculine-looking women. Or why Picasso seemed to both adore and loathe females. Or even why female artists, themselves, are so often neglected in Art History. No - it's just John, John, John.   Fact:  John isn't the only effeminate-looking male Leonardo rendered.   Still not convinced? You need to familiarize yourself with some of Leonardo's sketches, then, just as Sigmund Freud did.   ( Warning: Mature Content ) Whether or not  Leonardo was gay , he certainly devoted more attention to male anatomy and beautiful males in general, than he did to female anatomy or females. There are some rather sensuous young men depicted in his notebooks, complete with long, curly tresses and modestly downcast, heavy-lidded eyes. There is one in particular I would invite you to look up,  if  you are over the age of eighteen. Leonardo's so-called  Angel in the Flesh  figure has a sweet, feminine face (almost an exact likeness of  The Last Supper's  John) and a slightly swollen bosom (ditto) across which he is holding some form of drapery. However, if you direct your gaze a tad south of the border, you will note the unmistakable Sign of Manhood. One which seems awfully darn pleased with itself, if you ask me.   Google  that  at your own risk, and it will clarify much about John's gender.

Sign Up Discuss  in my Forum   Please explain that ""V"" and/or ""M"" By  Shelley Esaak , About.com    Filed In: Artists  A to Z   >  Famous Works of Art >  Famous Paintings >  Leonardo's Last Supper >  Last Supper FAQs                Question:  Please explain that ""V"" and/or ""M"" Answer:  ""As anyone can plainly see, the space between Jesus and John, or Mary, or whoever it really is, forms the letter 'V'. How do you explain this?""    This question frequently comes up. The  negative space  between these two figures in Leonardo's  Last Supper  is, indeed, ""vee""-shaped. No argument from me. Additionally, if one looks at the negative space  and  those two figures together, a sort of clunky ""M"" can be formed. And, yes, ""anyone can plainly see"" this, if they are inclined to look for it.    How do I explain this? To my mind, it's a matter of perspective. I mean that both literally and figuratively.     See, I've always viewed this picture not as mysterious, or mystical, or even particularly religious. To me, it's ""merely"" one of the greatest examples of one-point  perspective  on earth. When I look at it - at least up until recently, mind you - I see a composition with five figural pyramids (i.e.: 3-3-1-3-3) that strike a superb balance all the way across the painting. Their placement is such that one's eye is always directed to the Big Guy pyramid in the middle, whose head is right in front of the vanishing point.    This is what I see, because I am also looking with the figurative  perspective  of an artist who will cease trying to compose better pictures only when dead. (For you non-artists, when another artist does something so incredibly great that you're slack-jawed with envy, you either give up art entirely or try to figure out how s/he did it.)  So, when looking at the  Last Supper , I see an incredible composition that I  might  have come up with, myself - if only I was five-bizillion-percent better, as an artist, and somewhere in Leonardo's league. (Or even on Leonardo's farm team.) Hidden letters, no. I am not saying you have to see this, too.    Now, if a body goes looking for a ""V"" or an ""M"" (which, let's face it, we've  all  done after reading The Da Vinci Code), yes! There they are! Mr. Brown's literary  perspective  in action, and as clear as day. Many people are inclined to agree with this perspective and assign it all sorts of delicious possibilities. This is fine, and, frankly, sounds way more fun than talking about compositional elements.    Was this ""V""/""M"" simply an offshoot of the composition and Leonardo's incomparable use of perspective, was he hiding a secret code in there, or was the latter cleverly accomplished by use of the first? We can guess and debate from now until our sun expands to red giant stage, but no one can say conclusively what Leonardo was doing. Not for the first time, my strongest desire is that he'd left us some _____ (insert your favorite expletive here) written proof so we could all talk about something else.    Anyway - what's most important in all this is  what  you  think . It would be nice if you'd consider the one-point perspective business, but not expected. If you're convinced that there is hidden code in the  Last Supper , my little words about composition aren't going to dissuade you. Nor should they, as you might be proven right about hidden letters. You might even be the person who finds the proof. In that case, remember me when you're mailing out review copies of your book, please.    In sum, I'd respectfully submit that - as with everything else surrounding the Last Supper, post-DVC publication - the hidden letters are a matter of ""po·tay·to"" and ""po·tah·to"". Lacking any official word from that big tease Leonardo, we're free to see what we see as individuals. I see pyramids and negative space, but can comfortably co-exist with opinions that see beyond that.    Go to "" Is that a man or a woman in The Last Supper?

clueweb09-en0008-66-23574	                                     the last      supper painting                                                                            One of   the most famous works of Leonardo da Vinci is The Last Supper painting. Leonardo da   Vinci was a genius who though popularly known as a painter was a man of   multiple and diverse talents. He had a keen eye and quick mind that led him   to make important scientific discoveries, yet he never published his ideas.           Leonardo da Vinci was already a famous and well-known artist by the time he   was asked to do this painting .. The Last Supper. He did The Last Supper   painting on plaster by placing this plaster on the wall of the Dominican   convent of St. Maria delle Grazie.          It took him almost four years to complete this painting between the years of   1495 to 1498. Since the time he did this painting it has been vandalized and   it almost nearly did fall apart too. In fact many long-standing efforts have   been taken to stabilize and restore this famous Last Supper Painting for   future use.     The Last Supper        has gained much attention in recent times thanks to the novel   by Dan Brown called The Da Vinci Code. This book describes the mysterious   elements in this painting. Leonardo da Vinci was known to convey hidden   messages in most of his paintings and also all his other creations.                In this famous Last Supper painting by him he apparently wanted to bring to   the forefront the forgotten Mary Magdalene who was supposedly the forgotten   companion of Christ. Leonardo has worked on this painting based on the few   known documents, which describe this meal. Leonardo da Vinci has rearranged   the facts of this important event a little to convey his own thoughts and   feelings on the subject.                 Directories :   art & museums      painting   drawing    tribal tattoos  ::      learn to draw      Home                         Copyright  2000.Indianchild.com.

And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.     And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?     And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.          --Matthew 26                        Technique used in The Last Supper         Novelist  Dan Brown   in his blockbuster novel  The Da Vinci Code  committed an error, he claimed that Da Vinci's' masterpiece was a fresco which in fact it wasn't, It was what we call a  tempera.          Had it been a fresco (a technique where the painting is done when the plaster on the wall is still wet therefore the colors intermingles permanently with the plaster and is permanent.) it wouldn't have weathered and wouldn't be falling off the way it has been for all these years.         Leonardo Da Vinci chose to adopt this new style, which we now know as tempera. Egg yolk and vinegar was mixed with oil colors and painted on dry plaster. That way it made it easy to be redone when necessary. However this technique proved to be disastrous, the painting almost immediately began to fall off the plaster.

As he said he first object of the painter is to make a flat plane appear as a body in relief and projecting from that plane.               Although Da vinci produced a relatively small number of paintings, many of which were unfinished, his experimentation with the form and style influenced the later generations of painters. His handling of compostions is both rhythmic and evocative. He dealt with not only the subect but also with the atmosphere of the compositions. This is what set him apart. The aura of mystery around  Mona Lisa , the sense of foreboding in the  Christian Painting , a href=""http://ethnicpaintings.com/famous-paintings/the-last-supper-painting.html"" class=""textlinks"">The Last Supper can never be recreated.               Leonardo Da Vinci- the man          Da Vinci was born in the village of Anchiano, a few miles from the small town of Vinci, in Tuscany, near Florence. He was born to a wealthy Florentine notary and a peasant woman. In the mid-1460s his family moved to Florence, where Leonardo was given the best education that Florence, a major intellectual and artistic center of Italy, could offer                To say Leonardo Da Vinci was a versatile genius would be an easy task, to enumerate his exploits in different field, would be an almost impossible task. He concieved many scientific ideas which were way ahead of his time. Some of his notable conceptual inventions are; the helicopter,the tank, solar energy. However this wonderful concepts were not feasible in those times.          He also greatly advanced the state of knowledge in the fields of anatomy,engineering and optics.          His Vitruvian Man (a drawing) is a perfect synthesis of his knowledge of art, mathemetics, geometry and anatomy.           His notebooks and sketches gives us an insight into his great mind.

As it is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it would be impossible to select just a few and present them as the best without attracting fierce debate, of which there could not ever be a winner.     Here I have compiled a short reference to present the top 3 most famous painters of all time.      Leonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519)- Renaissance   It is without debate that the number 1 spot belongs to no other than Leonardo Da Vinci. Often referred to as the father of Renaissance, and a master of perspective, the influence of Leonardo Da Vinci today extends far beyond the realm of artistic endeavor.    Inspired and encouraged by growing up in an environment rich in scholarly flavor, Da Vinci created only six major works in painting. All six of this works are masterpieces of significance.  Da Vinci is renowned for his work in such fields as architecture, engineering, natural science mathematics and geometry.   Leonardo became the first painter, architect, and engineer for King Francis 1st in France. It was the King himself at his side on the 2nd of May, 1519 when he died.    leonardo da vinci paintings           Leonardo da Vinci paintings of women music video                            Click To Watch             The track title is Serenity and is available as a free mp3 download from www.barrymitchellmusic.comDetails of paintings of women by Leonardo da Vinci with music...                Uploaded:  November 30, 1999 at 12:00 am       Author:  triplesharp               Length:  02:28       Rating:  4.65       Views:  64737               Tags:   art    classical    da    fresco    jesus    last    Leonardo    lisa    magdalene    mary    mona    music    painting    portrait    saint    supper    vinci    women                                  Mona Lisa Leonardo da Vinci Louvre                            Click To Watch             Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda.

Although he often created his master pieces with everyday objects, such as sunflowers and an empty chair, his art is intensely emotional.   Vincent Van Gogh was born the son of a pastor and grew up in a cultured and religious atmosphere. He first worked in a book store and as an art salesman before becoming a preacher for which he was latter dismissed for being overzealous. In 1880, he turned to the study of art with the determination to give joy by creating beauty.    Van Gogh suffered severe bouts of depression and has been described as a ""difficult companion"", an understated comment when considering that during one of his ""difficult"" episodes he attempted to attack his closest friend and peer, Gauguin, with a razor. The attack was successfully defended but Van Gogh then famously cut off a part of his own ear.   Van Gogh's depression and tantrums worsened and he began to suffer fits of madness and was admitted to an asylum.  In 1890, two months after his release from the asylum Vincent Van Gogh died by suicide, only ever having sold one painting. Over 200 years after his death, or deeply tragic life, the works of Vincent Van Gogh are immortal.    Salvador Dali- (1904-1989)- Surrealism    The paintings of Salvador Dali depict strange hallucinatory characters of burning giraffes and seemingly melted wax watches. Dali described his own works as ""hand-painted dream photographs"".   Dali is famous for his many talents apart from painting, sculpture, jewelry design, book illustration as well as theatre work, making the first ever surrealistic film, ""Un chien andalou"" in 1929 and even writing a novel, ""Hidden Faces"" in 1944.   Although Dali is best known as representing the surrealist movement, he skillfully developed his own deviation which he named ""critical paranoia"". Dali's theory supporting critical paranoia is that one should cultivate delusion while awareness and will suspended in thought.   If the sum of a man is his character, one would still be confused as to who Salvador Dali was. He cannot possibly be described in few short paragraphs.

The clouds are painted normally, but the ocean began with tissue paper glued on with matt medium. The wrinkles strongly suggest waves with very little help.   From the Painting Guide:  What glorious colors in the clouds, giving a great sense of the surfer having stayed in until the very last light of the day.   Things to Consider When Looking at This Painting:   Composition:  Look at where the horizon line is in relation to height of the painting, and how it's emphasized by the bands of color immediately above it. Do you think it cuts the painting in half; should it be moved up or down a bit? Or do you think the two distinct sections of the painting are strong enough to overcome this?

By  Marion Boddy-Evans , About.com    Filed In: Painting for Beginners   >  Painting Tips >  Painting Tips for Beginners                   I get the last out of a tube of paint by using scissors to cut off the end, then scrape out all with a small spatula or anything small enough.  Tip from: Nora Ortega .     After you have rolled that paint tube until there's no more room to roll, but you are annoyed because you can still see paint in there, grab your canvas stretching pliers. Mine have nice wide jaws that are perfect for getting that last dollop of paint out of a tube.   Tip from: Karen   When a tube of paint starts getting empty and I want to ensure I've got most of it out, I use the handle of a brush to squeeze the paint towards the lid -- running it down the tube from the end of the tube to the lid. Sure it's not designed for this, but a brush is always to hand! Tip from: Agatha .     Submit Your Own Painting Tip:  Got a great painting tip to share with other artists?

By  Marion Boddy-Evans , About.com    See More About: old master painting techniques rembrandt leonardo da vinci     Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, in the Louvre in Paris, is probably the best known example of sfumato. Image: Stuart Gregory / Getty Images             There are two classic styles of painting which we associate with the Old Masters,  sfumato  and  chiaroscuro , and they are as alike as cheese and chalk. But we still manage to confuse them, and which artists made use of which styles.   Sfmuato and Leonardo da Vinci   Sfumato  refers to the subtle gradation of  tone  which was used to obscure sharp edges and create a synergy between lights and shadows in a painting. As Ernst Gombrich 2 , one of the twentieth-centuries most famous art historians, explains: "" [t]his is Leonardo's famous invention … the blurred outline and mellowed colours that allow one form to merge with another and always leave something to our imagination. ""     Leonardo da Vinci  used the technique with great mastery; in his painting the  Mona Lisa  those enigmatic aspects of her smile have been achieved precisely by this method, and we are left to fill in the detail.     How, exactly, did Leonardo achieve this effect? For the painting as a whole he selected a range of unifying midtones, especially the blues, greens, and earths, which had similar levels of saturation. By avoiding the most luminous of colors for his brights, which could break the unity, the midtones thus created a subdued flavor to the picture. Leonardo da Vinci is quoted as saying "" [w]hen you want to make a portrait, do it in dull weather, or as evening falls. 3 "".  Sfumato takes us one stage further though, away from the focal point of the picture, the midtones blend into shadow, color dissipates into monochromatic darks, much the same as you get on a photographic image with a tight focal range. Sfumato makes an choice if your portrait sitter is embarrassed by wrinkles!   Chiaroscuro and Rembrandt   In comparison the paintings of Caravaggio, Correggio, and, of course,  Rembrandt , have a heavy-handed approach to light and shadow. The focus of the painting is illuminated, as if in a spotlight, while the surrounding field is dark and somber – heavy, burnt browns melding to black. This is  chiaroscuro , literally ""light-dark"", a technique which was used to great effect to create dramatic contrasts.     The effect was created using successive glazes of transparent brown. Notorious now, since the brown paints used by the later Renaissance artists tended to be tar based (bitumen) or burnt beechwood ( bistre ) causes problems in old master paintings by residue seeping through the canvas.  You can create the chiaroscuro effect using  glazes  of umber (or burnt umber if you want a warmer picture). Remember that if you need to touch up highlights near to the darkened shadow areas, you should warm your colors; add a little red to the mix to make up for the cooling effect of the surrounding darks.

Two of famous Leonardo da Vinci Paintings, the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper occupy unique positions as the most famous, most reproduced and most parodied portrait and religious painting of all time, their fame approached only by The Creation of Adam.   -  Leonardo da Vinci  - High Renaissance Movement 1452-1519                         About Leonardo da Vinci:     The most Famous Italian Artist,  Leonardo Da Vinci  has often been described as the archetype of the ""Renaissance man"", a man whose seemingly infinite curiosity was equalled only by his powers of invention. Leonardo is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. Leonardo da Vinci's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last Supper, painted in Milan. The painting represents the last meal shared by Jesus with his disciples before his capture and death. Among the paintings created by Leonardo da Vinci in the 1500s is the small portrait known as the Mona Lisa or ""la Gioconda"",the laughing one. The painting is famous for the elusive smile on the woman's face, its mysterious quality brought about perhaps by the fact that the artist has subtly shadowed the corners of the mouth and eyes so that the exact nature of the smile cannot be determined.

Little is known about his training and work. Even if not actually a pupil of Rogier himself, Bouts was profoundly affected by his work. He continued and developed Rogiers style to an almost radical degree: his preference of vertical compositions, of types instead of individual, exquisite, thoroughly detailed garments, which conceal the body, looks like a return to the Gothic. Whether Bouts was the founder of this gothic revival, a characteristic of Netherlandish Northern Renaissance, or whether the painter was simply part of the more general trend sweeping over Europe after the middle of the century, is hard to decide. Whatever the case, the stylistic features already described intensified after The Last Supper Altar in Leuven (1464-1467) to the Justice panels in Brussels (begun 1468). The Last Supper from Sankt Peter in Leuven forms the central panel of a winged altarpiece commissioned by the confraternity of the Holy Sacrament. The painter was bound by contract to execute the work himself and thereby to follow the directions of two professors of theology.              In 1468, Bouts was commissioned to paint 4 panels for the courtroom of the city of Leuven. By the time he died, however, he had only finished one painting: The Empress's Ordeal by Fire in front of Emperor Otto III. (c.1470-1475). The episode related in the panel concerns calumny. The Empress is denouncing the innocent Count, whom she attempted to seduce, to Otto III. She is subjected to an ordeal by fire, which proves to the Counts innocence. The story is derived from the Biblical tale of Potiphars wife, who tried to seduce Joseph in Egypt and who leveled false accusations at him when he refused her. Bouts may have taken his inspiration from Rogier van der Weyden, who painted similar subjects for the Town Hall in Brussels in 1436; however, these were destroyed in 1695.               In 1465, Bouts married Katharina van der Brugghen, the daughter of a respectable Leuven family. He remained based in Leuven enjoying an excellent reputation as a painter. He is last mentioned in records dated 17 April 1475.              It is frequently difficult to draw a clear line between his own work and that of his workshop, including his son Dieric Bouts the Younger. It is therefore impossible to make a fair assessment of his art.  ....
