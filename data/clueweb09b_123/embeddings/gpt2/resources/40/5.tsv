Politics, naturally. It's a way to keep slicing off some of what has traditionally been a Republican vote.

He is the first  African American  to hold the office. Obama was the  junior   United States Senator  from  Illinois  from 2005 until he resigned following his  election  to the  presidency . He was  inaugurated  as President on January 20, 2009.   Obama is a graduate of  Columbia University  and  Harvard Law School , where he was the  first African American  president of the  Harvard Law Review . He worked as a  community organizer  in  Chicago  prior to earning his law degree, and practiced as a  civil rights  attorney in Chicago before serving three terms in the  Illinois Senate  from 1997 to 2004. He also taught  Constitutional Law  at the  University of Chicago Law School  from 1992 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the  U.S. House of Representatives  in 2000, Obama was elected to the Senate in November 2004. Obama delivered the  keynote address  at the  Democratic National Convention  in July 2004.

Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language  class at the  University of Hawaii at Mnoa , where his father was a foreign student on scholarship. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  The couple married on February 2, 1961 [ 14 ] , and Obama was born later that year. Obama's parents separated when Obama was two years old, and they divorced in 1964. [ 13 ]  Obama's father returned to Kenya and saw his son only once more before dying in an automobile accident in 1982. [ 15 ]   After her divorce, Dunham married  Indonesian  student  Lolo Soetoro , who was attending college in Hawaii. When  Soeharto , a military leader in Soetoro's home country,  came to power  in 1967, all students studying abroad were recalled and the family moved to  Indonesia . [ 16 ]  There Obama attended local schools in  Jakarta , such as Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, until he was ten years old.   He then returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn  and  Stanley Armour Dunham , while attending  Punahou School  from the  fifth grade  in 1971 until his graduation from high school in 1979. [ 17 ]  Obama's mother returned to Hawaii in 1972 for five years, and then in 1977 went back to Indonesia, where she worked as an  anthropological  field worker. She stayed there most of the rest of her life, returning to Hawaii in 1994. She died of  ovarian cancer  in 1995. [ 18 ]          Right-to-left: Barack Obama and half-sister  Maya Soetoro-Ng , with their mother  Ann Dunham  and grandfather  Stanley Dunham , in Hawaii (early 1970s).       Of his early childhood, Obama has recalled, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me  that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk  barely registered in my mind."" [ 19 ]  In his 1995 memoir, he described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his  multiracial  heritage. [ 20 ]  He wrote that he used  alcohol ,  marijuana  and  cocaine  during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind."" [ 21 ]  At the  2008 Civil Forum on the Presidency , Obama identified his high-school drug use as his ""greatest moral failure."" [ 22 ]   Some of his fellow students at Punahou School later told the  Honolulu Star-Bulletin  that Obama was mature for his age, and that he sometimes attended college parties and other events in order to associate with African American students and military service people. Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered  to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect  became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."" [ 23 ]   Following high school, Obama moved to  Los Angeles  in 1979 to attend  Occidental College . [ 24 ]  After two years he transferred in 1981 to  Columbia University  in New York City, where he majored in  political science  with a specialization in  international relations . [ 25 ]  Obama graduated with a  B.A.  from Columbia in 1983. He worked for a year at the  Business International Corporation [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  and then at the  New York Public Interest Research Group . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]   After four years in New York City, Obama moved to Chicago, where he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based  community organization  originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland ( Roseland ,  West Pullman  and  Riverdale ) on Chicago's far  South Side . He worked there for three years from June 1985 to May 1988. [ 28 ] [ 30 ]  During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from one to thirteen and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000. His achievements included helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens . [ 31 ]  Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation , a community organizing institute. [ 32 ]  In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time to Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives  for the first time. [ 33 ]   Obama entered  Harvard Law School  in late 1988. He was selected as an editor of the  Harvard Law Review  at the end of his first year, [ 34 ]  and president of the journal in his second year. [ 35 ]  During his summers, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley & Austin  in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter  in 1990. [ 36 ]  After graduating with a  Juris Doctor (J.D.)   magna cum laude [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. [ 34 ]   Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review  gained national media attention [ 35 ]  and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations. [ 39 ]  In an effort to recruit him to their faculty, the  University of Chicago Law School  provided Obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. [ 39 ]  He originally planned to finish the book in one year, but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir. In order to work without interruptions, Obama and his wife,  Michelle , traveled to  Bali  where he wrote for several months. The manuscript was finally published in mid-1995 as  Dreams from My Father . [ 39 ]   From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote , a voter registration drive with a staff of ten and 700 volunteers; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, and led to  Crain's Chicago Business  naming Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be. [ 40 ] [ 41 ]   For twelve years, Obama served as a professor at the  University of Chicago Law School  teaching  Constitutional Law . He was first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996 and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004. [ 42 ]  He also joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a twelve-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate  for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel  from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002. [ 28 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]   Obama was a founding member of the board of directors of  Public Allies  in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993. [ 28 ] [ 45 ]  He served from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago , which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and also from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Joyce Foundation . [ 28 ]  Obama served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge  from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. [ 28 ]  He also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, and the Lugenia Burns Hope Center. [ 28 ]     Political career: 19962008     State legislator: 19972004       Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate  in 1996, succeeding State Senator  Alice Palmer  as Senator from Illinois's 13th District, which then spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park - Kenwood  south to  South Shore  and west to  Chicago Lawn . [ 46 ]  Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation reforming ethics and health care laws. [ 47 ]  He sponsored a law increasing  tax credits  for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. [ 48 ]  In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures. [ 49 ]   Obama was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002. [ 50 ]  In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary run for  the U.S. House of Representatives  to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush  by a margin of two to one. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. [ 53 ]  He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling  by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. [ 48 ] [ 54 ]  During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty  reforms. [ 55 ]  Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. [ 56 ]     2004 U.S. Senate campaign     See also:  United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004     In mid-2002, Obama began considering a run for the U.S. Senate; he enlisted political strategist  David Axelrod  that fall and formally announced his candidacy in January 2003. [ 57 ]  Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald  and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun  not to contest the race launched wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. [ 58 ]  Obama's candidacy was boosted by Axelrod's advertising campaign featuring images of the late Chicago Mayor  Harold Washington  and an endorsement by the daughter of the late  Paul Simon , former U.S. Senator for Illinois. [ 59 ]  He received over 52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival. [ 60 ]   In July 2004, Obama wrote and delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention  in Boston, Massachusetts. [ 61 ]  After describing his maternal grandfather's experiences as a  World War II  veteran and a beneficiary of the  New Deal's   FHA  and  G.I. Bill  programs, Obama spoke about changing the U.S. government's economic and social priorities. He questioned the Bush administration's management of the Iraq War and highlighted America's obligations to its soldiers. Drawing examples from U.S. history, he criticized heavily partisan views of the electorate and asked Americans to find unity in diversity, saying, ""There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America."" [ 62 ]  Though it was not televised by the  three major broadcast news networks , a combined 9.1 million viewers watching on  PBS ,  CNN ,  MSNBC ,  Fox News  and  C-SPAN  saw Obama's speech, which was a highlight of the convention and confirmed his status as the Democratic Party's brightest new star. [ 63 ]   Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan , withdrew from the race in June 2004. [ 64 ]  Two months later and less than three months before Election Day,  Alan Keyes  accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. [ 65 ]  A long-time resident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois with the nomination. [ 66 ]  In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70% of the vote to Keyes' 27%, the largest victory margin for a statewide race in Illinois history. [ 67 ]     U.S. Senator: 20052008       Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 4, 2005. [ 68 ]  Obama was the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, and the third to have been  popularly elected . [ 69 ]  He was the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus . [ 70 ]   CQ Weekly ,  a nonpartisan publication, characterized him as a ""loyal Democrat"" based on analysis of all Senate votes in 20052007. The  National Journal  ranked him as the ""most liberal"" senator based on an assessment of selected votes during 2007; in 2005 he was ranked sixteenth most liberal, and in 2006 he was ranked tenth. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]  In 2008, Congress.org ranked him as the eleventh most powerful Senator. [ 73 ]  Obama announced on November 13, 2008 that he would resign his senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck  session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]  This enabled him to avoid the conflict of dual roles as President-elect and Senator in the lame duck session of Congress, which no sitting member of Congress had faced since  Warren Harding . [ 76 ]     Legislation     See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate            Senate bill sponsors Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Obama discussing the CoburnObama Transparency Act. [ 77 ]       Obama voted in favor of the  Energy Policy Act of 2005  and cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act . [ 78 ]  In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the  Secure Fence Act . [ 79 ]  Obama introduced two initiatives bearing his name: LugarObama, which expanded the  NunnLugar cooperative threat reduction  concept to conventional weapons, [ 80 ]  and the  CoburnObama Transparency Act , which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. [ 81 ]  On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama, along with Senators  Thomas R. Carper ,  Tom Coburn , and  John McCain , introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. [ 82 ]   Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. [ 83 ]  Obama is not hostile to  tort reform  and voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005  and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008  which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping  operations. [ 84 ]   In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. [ 85 ]  In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act , which was signed into law in September 2007. [ 86 ]  Obama also introduced  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act , a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections [ 87 ]  and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007 , [ 88 ]  neither of which have been signed into law.          Obama and U.S. Sen.  Richard Lugar  (R-IN) visit a Russian mobile launch missile dismantling facility in August 2005. [ 89 ]       Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges. [ 90 ]  This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. [ 91 ]  He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. [ 92 ] [ 93 ]  Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program  providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries. [ 94 ]     Committees   Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations ,  Environment and Public Works  and  Veterans' Affairs  through December 2006. [ 95 ]  In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions  and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs . [ 96 ]  He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs . [ 97 ]  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas  before he became  President  of the  Palestinian Authority , and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi  condemning corruption in the Kenyan government. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ]       2008 Presidential campaign       Main articles:  Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008  and  Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008             Wikinews  has related news:  Barack Obama elected 44th President of the United States       On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol  building in  Springfield, Illinois . [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The choice of the announcement site was symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln  delivered his historic  ""House Divided""  speech in 1858. [ 104 ]  Throughout the campaign, Obama emphasized the issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War , increasing  energy independence  and providing  universal health care . [ 105 ]          Obama stands on stage with his wife and two daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois , Feb. 10, 2007.       During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ]  On June 19, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing  in the general election since the system was created in 1976. [ 109 ]   A large number of candidates initially entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries . After a few initial contests, the field narrowed to a contest between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton , with each winning some states and the race remaining close throughout the primary process. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ]  On May 31, the  Democratic National Committee  agreed to seat all of the disputed  Michigan  and  Florida  delegates at the national convention, each with a half-vote, narrowing Obama's delegate lead. [ 114 ]  On June 3, with all states counted, Obama passed the threshold to become the  presumptive nominee . [ 115 ] [ 116 ]  On that day, he gave a victory speech in St. Paul, Minnesota. Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed him on June 7. [ 117 ]  From that point on, he campaigned for the general election race against Senator  John McCain , the  Republican  nominee.   On August 23, 2008, Obama announced that he had selected  Delaware  Senator  Joe Biden  as his vice presidential running mate. [ 118 ]          Obama delivers  his presidential election victory speech  in  Grant Park .       At the  Democratic National Convention  in  Denver ,  Colorado , Obama's former rival Hillary Clinton gave a speech in support of Obama's candidacy and later called for Obama to be nominated by  acclamation  as the Democratic presidential candidate. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  On August 28, Obama delivered a speech to 84,000 supporters in Denver. During the speech, which was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide, he accepted his party's nomination and presented his policy goals. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   After McCain was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, there were three  presidential debates  between Obama and McCain in September and October 2008. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  In November, Obama won the presidency with 53% of the  popular vote  and a wide  electoral vote  margin. His election sparked street celebrations in numerous cities in the United States [ 125 ]  and abroad.     Election victory       Main article:  Presidential transition of Barack Obama              Obama meets with then-President George W. Bush in the  Oval Office  on November 10, 2008.       On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the general election with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173 [ 126 ]  and became the first  African American  to be elected President of the United States. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In his  victory speech , delivered before a crowd of hundreds of thousands of his supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park , Obama proclaimed that ""change has come to America"". [ 131 ]  On January 8, 2009, a  joint session  of the  U.S. Congress  certified the  Electoral College  votes, officially declaring that Obama was elected President. [ 132 ]     Presidency       Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama       The  inauguration of Barack Obama  as the forty-fourth President, and Joe Biden as Vice President, took place on January 20, 2009. The theme of the inauguration was ""A New Birth of Freedom,"" commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of  Abraham Lincoln . [ 133 ]   In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda reversing President Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign establishments that allow abortions (known as the  Mexico City Policy  and referred by critics as the ""Global Gag Rule""), [ 134 ]  changed procedures to promote disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act [ 135 ] , directed the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from  Iraq [ 136 ] , and reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. [ 137 ]  He also issued orders closing  Guantanamo Bay detention camp  ""as soon as practicable and no later than"" January 2010. [ 138 ]     Political positions       Main article:  Political positions of Barack Obama       A method that some political scientists use for gauging  ideology  is to compare the annual ratings by the  Americans for Democratic Action  (ADA) with the ratings by the  American Conservative Union  (ACU). [ 139 ]  Based on his years in Congress, Obama has a lifetime average conservative rating of 7.67% from the ACU, [ 140 ]  and a lifetime average liberal rating of 90% from the ADA. [ 141 ]          Obama campaigning in  Abington, Pennsylvania , October 2008.       Obama was an early opponent of the Bush administration's  policies on Iraq . [ 142 ]  On October 2, 2002, the day President  George W. Bush  and  Congress  agreed on the  joint resolution  authorizing the Iraq War, [ 143 ]  Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally  in  Federal Plaza , [ 144 ]  speaking out against the war. [ 145 ] [ 146 ]  On March 16, 2003, the day Bush issued his 48-hour  ultimatum  to  Saddam Hussein  to leave Iraq before the U.S.  invasion of Iraq , [ 147 ]  Obama addressed the largest Chicago anti-Iraq War rally to date in  Daley Plaza  and told the crowd that ""it's not too late"" to stop the war. [ 148 ]  Although Obama had previously said he wanted all the U.S. troops out of Iraq within 16 months of becoming President, after he won the primary, he said he might refine plans as further developments unfold. [ 149 ]   Obama stated that if elected he would enact budget cuts in the range of tens of billions of dollars, stop investing in ""unproven""  missile defense systems , not weaponize space, ""slow development of  Future Combat Systems ,"" and work towards eliminating all  nuclear weapons . Obama favors ending development of new nuclear weapons, reducing the current U.S. nuclear stockpile, enacting a global ban on production of fissile material, and seeking negotiations with Russia in order to make it less necessary to have  ICBMs  on high-alert status. [ 150 ]   In November 2006, Obama called for a ""phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq"" and an opening of diplomatic dialogue with  Syria  and  Iran . [ 151 ]  In a March 2007 speech to  AIPAC , a  pro-Israel lobby , he said that the primary way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is through talks and diplomacy, although he did not rule out military action. [ 152 ]  Obama has indicated that he would engage in ""direct presidential diplomacy"" with Iran without preconditions. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ]  Detailing his strategy for fighting global terrorism in August 2007, Obama said ""it was a terrible mistake to fail to act"" against a 2005 meeting of al-Qaeda leaders that U.S. intelligence had confirmed to be taking place in Pakistan's  Federally Administered Tribal Areas . He said that as president he would not miss a similar opportunity, even without the support of the Pakistani government. [ 156 ]   In a December 2005,  Washington Post  opinion column, and at the  Save Darfur  rally in April 2006, Obama called for more assertive action to oppose  genocide  in the  Darfur region  of  Sudan . [ 157 ]  He has  divested  $180,000 in personal holdings of Sudan-related stock, and has urged divestment from companies doing business in Iran. [ 158 ]  In the JulyAugust 2007 issue of  Foreign Affairs , Obama called for an outward looking post-Iraq War  foreign policy  and the renewal of American military, diplomatic, and moral leadership in the world. Saying that ""we can neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission,"" he called on Americans to ""lead the world, by deed and by example."" [ 159 ]   In economic affairs, in April 2005, he defended the New Deal social welfare policies of  Franklin D. Roosevelt  and opposed Republican proposals to establish private accounts for  Social Security . [ 160 ]  In the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina , Obama spoke out against government indifference to growing economic class divisions, calling on both political parties to take action to restore the  social safety net  for the poor. [ 161 ]  Shortly before announcing his presidential campaign, Obama said he supports  universal health care  in the United States. [ 162 ]  Obama proposes to reward teachers for performance from traditional  merit pay  systems, assuring unions that changes would be pursued through the  collective bargaining  process. [ 163 ]   In September 2007, he blamed  special interests  for distorting the  U.S. tax code . [ 164 ]  His plan would eliminate taxes for  senior citizens  with incomes of less than $50,000 a year, repeal income tax cuts for those making over $250,000 as well as the capital gains and dividends tax cut, [ 165 ]  close corporate tax loopholes, lift the income cap on Social Security taxes, restrict offshore  tax havens , and simplify filing of income tax returns by pre-filling wage and bank information already collected by the  IRS . [ 166 ]  Announcing his presidential campaign's energy plan in October 2007, Obama proposed a  cap and trade  auction system to restrict carbon emissions and a ten year program of investments in new energy sources to reduce  U.S. dependence on imported oil . [ 167 ]  Obama proposed that all pollution credits must be auctioned, with no  grandfathering  of credits for oil and gas companies, and the spending of the revenue obtained on energy development and economic transition costs. [ 168 ]     Family and personal life       Main articles:  Early life and career of Barack Obama  and  Family of Barack Obama              Barack Obama and his wife  Michelle Obama .       In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family. ""It's like a little mini-United Nations."" he said. ""I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac , and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher ."" [ 169 ]  Obama has seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living, and a half-sister with whom he was raised,  Maya Soetoro-Ng , the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband. [ 170 ]  Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham [ 171 ]  until her death on November 2, 2008, just before the presidential election. [ 172 ]  In  Dreams from My Father , Obama ties his mother's family history to possible  Native American  ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis , president of the southern Confederacy during the  American Civil War . [ 173 ]  Obama's maternal and paternal grandfathers fought in  World War II . Obama's great-uncle served in the  89th Division  that overran  Ohrdruf , [ 174 ]  the first Nazi camp liberated by U.S. troops. [ 175 ]   Besides his native English, Obama speaks  Indonesian , at least on a colloquial level, which he learned during his four childhood years in Jakarta. [ 176 ]  After the  APEC summit  in November 2008, Indonesian president  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  related a telephone conversation with Obama in Indonesian to Indonesian media. [ 177 ]   Obama was known as ""Barry"" in his youth, but asked to be addressed with his given name during his college years. [ 178 ]          Obama playing basketball with U.S. military at  Camp Lemonier ,  Djibouti  in 2006. [ 179 ]       He plays  basketball , a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team. [ 180 ]   In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson , whom he later married, when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin . [ 181 ]  Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. [ 182 ]  They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. [ 183 ]  The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, [ 184 ]  followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001. [ 185 ]  Because of Michelle Obama's employment with the  University of Chicago , the Obama daughters attended the private  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools . When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private  Sidwell Friends School . [ 186 ]   Applying the proceeds of a book deal, in 2005 the family moved from a  Hyde Park , Chicago condominium to their current $1.6 million house in neighboring  Kenwood . [ 187 ]  The purchase of the property was coordinated with  Tony Rezko , a major political contributor to Obama, who later sold part of the adjacent lot to the Obamas. The transaction attracted media attention because of Rezko's later indictment and subsequent conviction on political corruption charges for unrelated activities. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]   In December 2007,  Money  magazine estimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3 million. [ 190 ]  Their 2007 tax return showed a household income of $4.2 millionup from about $1 million in 2006 and $1.6 million in 2005mostly from sales of his books. [ 191 ]   Obama is a  Christian  whose religious views have evolved in his adult life. In  The Audacity of Hope , Obama writes that he ""was not raised in a religious household."" He describes his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as ""non-practicing Methodists and Baptists"") to be detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known."" He describes his father as ""raised a  Muslim ,"" but a ""confirmed  atheist "" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" In the book, Obama explains how, through working with  black churches  as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."" [ 192 ] [ 193 ]  He was baptized at the  Trinity United Church of Christ  in 1988 and was an active member there for two decades. [ 194 ] [ 195 ]   While he has never been a heavy smoker, Obama has tried to  quit smoking  several times, including a well-publicized and ongoing effort which he began before launching his presidential campaign. [ 196 ]  Obama has said he will not smoke in the White House. [ 197 ]     Cultural and political image       Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama       With his black Kenyan father and white American mother, his upbringing in Honolulu and Jakarta, and his  Ivy League  education, Obama's early life experiences differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement . [ 198 ]  Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists  that the debate is not about his physical appearance or his record on issues of concern to black voters. Obama said that ""we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."" [ 199 ]   Echoing the  inaugural address of John F. Kennedy , Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."" [ 200 ]  A popular  catch phrase  distilled the concept: "" Rosa   sat  so  Martin  could  walk ; Martin walked so Obama could run; Obama is running so our children can fly."" [ 201 ]          From left: Presidents  George H. W. Bush , Barack Obama,  George W. Bush ,  Bill Clinton  and  Jimmy Carter  meet in the  Oval Office  on January 7, 2009.       Obama has been praised as a master of  oratory  on par with other renowned speakers in the past such as  Martin Luther King, Jr. [ 202 ] [ 203 ]  His "" Yes We Can "" speech, which artists independently set to music in a video produced by  will.i.am , was viewed by 10 million people on  YouTube  in the first month, [ 204 ]  and received an  Emmy Award . [ 205 ]   University of Virginia  professor  Jonathan Haidt  researched the effectiveness of Obama's public speaking and concluded that part of his excellence is because the politician is adept at inspiring the emotion of  elevation , the desire to act morally and do good for others. [ 206 ]  Obama used these communication skills in a series of weekly internet video addresses during his pre-inauguration transition period; [ 207 ]  he has suggested he will make a series of broadcast and internet addresses similar to  Franklin D. Roosevelt 's famous  fireside chats  throughout his term as president to explain his policies and actions. [ 208 ]   Many commentators mentioned Obama's international appeal as a defining factor for his public image. [ 209 ]  Not only did several polls show strong support for him in other countries, [ 210 ]  but Obama also established close relationships with prominent foreign politicians and elected officials even before his presidential candidacy, notably with then incumbent  British Prime Minister   Tony Blair , whom he met in  London  in 2005, [ 211 ]  with  Italy 's  Democratic Party  leader and then  Mayor  of  Rome   Walter Veltroni , who visited Obama's Senate office in 2005, [ 212 ]  and with  French President   Nicolas Sarkozy , who also visited him in  Washington  in 2006. [ 213 ]   Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album   Grammy Awards  for  abridged   audiobook  versions of both of his books; for  Dreams from My Father  in February 2006 and for  The Audacity of Hope  in February 2008. [ 214 ]   In December 2008,  Time  magazine named Barack Obama as its  Person of the Year  for his historic candidacy and election, which it described as ""the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.""

""I think that from my understanding, President-elect Obama is trying to reach out to people that don't agree and do agree with him, to unite the country. I certainly don't agree with Reverend Rick Warren. I'm sure Reverend Warren doesn't agree with me on certain things. But I think there's room for everyone and I think that is what President Obama is trying do. I thought it was a very gracious thing. I think Warren said it was courageous. I think it was both,"" said Sharpton. ""I think that President-elect Obama showed a lot of graciousness extending this to him, showing that he's trying to pull the country together even with those he disagrees with and [those that are] frankly... less than gracious to him.""    The remarks come on the third day of sustained and loud protest over the invocation choice, which both Warren and Obama have labored to defend. Warren's views on gay rights, stem cell research and torture are seen not just as in complete contrast to Obama's agenda, but antithetical to the very inclusiveness that the president-elect is hoping to promote.     Four years ago, the shoe was on the other foot. For his reelection inauguration, George W. Bush asked Rev. Dr. Louis Leon of Washington's St. John's Church Lafayette Square to deliver the invocation. Leon and Bush had a personal relationship developed over the years that the president attended his church. The two also shared policy commitments towards fighting AIDS and, to a lesser extent, pushing immigration reform ( in one sermon  that Bush attended, Leon blasted Congress for its failure to pass legislation on the topic). The president, in fact,  sat in the pew  at Leon's church right after the attacks of September 11th.     But the two, as Leon acknowledges, had their share of political differences. And it was of some interest that Bush had tasked him for the inauguration spotlight.       Reached by phone and asked to compare his situation with the current one, Leon demurred. Pressed if he had any tips for Warren, he said: ""I wouldn't dare offer Reverend Warren a piece of advice.""     That said, the Warren and Leon comparisons go only so far. And progressives are right to note that Leon was never a symbol of exclusion the way that Warren, through his public support of Proposition 8 in California, has become.

Politics, naturally. It's a way to keep slicing off some of what has traditionally been a Republican vote.

He had most of my albums from the very first one. What? This didn't sound like a gay hater.

The best way to understand Warren's remark about supposedly loving ""gays"" is to look at his own church's policy statement about lesbian and gay people.

If there is a rational argument against gay marriage, I have yet to see it. And this is why Obama's invitation to Warren might just work. A major limitation to progressive thinking is our over-reliance on rational debate.

Well, I was given a gift regarding this particular topic.  Weve had some interesting developments in the Obama/Warren issue over the last couple of days, and although they are somewhat tangential to what I began discussing, the issues that have surfaced in the last few days point to some other aspects of this discussion that I had not thought to include.  Without further ado, let us begin.   A recent lawsuit seeks to bar the words So help me God and the invocation from the inauguration ceremonies.  Several atheist and non-religious groups say that including such phrases and practices excludes individuals who are not Christian or not religious from the ceremony who would otherwise enjoy the festivities.  Michael Newdow, who has tried this same tactic in the last two inauguration ceremonies, is one of the leaders of the resistance, so to speak.  You can read a CNN article concerning this lawsuit by clicking  here .  Whether or not Newdows lawsuit succeeds is of no importance to this particular discussion.  What it does bring to light for the purposes of our discussion of the gay marriage issue is the insertion of religion, or religious practices into government policy.  And this is the thing that I forgot to include in my last post.   Let me state right off that, while I do not believe that this country was founded as a Christian country (the First Amendment pretty much ends that argument), it would be silly for anyone to argue that, as abstractly religious as the Founders were, they were not still heavily influenced by Western Philosophy, which in turn was heavily influenced by Christianity.  Even at its most agnostic, Western Philosophy hinges heavily on Christian presuppositions about Human Nature and the nature of the Universe.  Even things like literary movements always meet great resistance from deeply religious circles because the movements are often thought of as challenging religious thought along with whatever literary suppositions happen to be en vogue at the time (see: Postmodernism).  In my last post, when I mentioned the institution of marriage, I failed to recognize, or to be more precise, to give homage to, how deeply entrenched religious views of marriage are, even for those who strongly support a separation of church and state.   The more important question that both the left and the right must ask is, How am I making the decision to support or oppose legislation regarding the nature of marriage?  As I mentioned before, there are a good number of members of the left that are up in arms about Obamas decision to invite Rick Warren to the inauguration.  But there are just as many members of the right that are  angry with Warren  for accepting the invitation.  Indeed, these are no doubt the same individuals that protested his decision to invite Obama to speak at his church months ago.  What is it that these groups hope to accomplish?  How are we to make any progress at all when there is intentional exclusion on both sides of the aisle?   It would seem that we are coming to a head in America.  I would hope that we get this all worked out, but it seems that both the right and the left are fit to split in two (which could also be a good thing).  The Democratic party nearly shit itself when it had to make a decision between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and the Republican party nearly did the same when, out of nowhere, John McCain steamrolled every other candidate.  Of course, the cynics on both sides say that the media chose the candidates and that the truly fine candidates were left by the wayside (and dont get me wrong, the media certainly bears responsibility when it comes to misinformation, just in a totally different way than these people believe), but when it comes down to it, those two men were the best candidates for this country.  Obama and McCain may have been called extreme by their opponents, but they are anything but extreme.  They, and Rick Warren, represent a new breed of political thinker that has only recently begun to make blips on the political radar screen.  They are rational individuals that are well aware of the fact that most people in this country, no matter how extreme left or right, do not have cut and dried political views.   Obama promised a changea new kind of politics.  His intentional and powerfully rhetorical use of the  United  States of America (with a strong emphasis on the word United), has special meaning here.  For Obama, the idea of a unified nation is more important than advancing a particular agenda.  To be sure, most of Obamas policies are informed by left leaning philosophy, and we can be sure that his approach will be more populist in nature than many conservatives may wish.  But his willingness to make concessionsin the words of political pundits, to flip-flopin order to make positive progress, proves him to have the countrys interests at heart, and not simply the interests of his own party.   Rick Warren is the conservative mirror image of Obama.  While there are social issues that Warren no doubt feels very strongly about, he is willing to make concessions in the name of progress.  And he is not alone.  In the June 30 issue of  The New Yorker , there was an article titled  The New Evangelicals  which focused on a new movement within the evangelical community that seeks to fight poverty, AIDS, disease and inequality in third world countries, religious persecution, etc., in the name of human decency.  They are what we might call religious humanists.  They are not unlike another group that co-exists with the New Evangelicals called Red Letter Christians.  You can get a brief idea of what they are about, and follow a few links, by reading the  Wikipedia article on Red-Letter Christians .  These groups focus on social justice, and they share this passion with many progressive and left-leaning groups.  In the last post I mentioned a conversation between Melissa Etheridge and Rick Warren.  The reason this conversation took place was because both Warren and Etheridge were invited to speak at the Muslim Public Affairs Council conference in Long Beach, CA.  You can watch or download Warren’s speech (and probably some others if you do a little rooting around) by following  this link .  In his speech, Warren echoed many of the same ideas about religion that Obama has emphasized about politics.   All of this brings us back to the issue at hand.  What do we make of Obamas invitation to Warren?  Well, all of those members of the left and the right that have grave reservations about Warrens appearance at the inauguration need to consider the message of the two men they criticize.  Obamas choice has been called a political move, its been said that it shows his true feelings about homosexuals and lesbians, and its been criticized as a step away from unification.  I think that, out of all of the descriptions that weve been given, the one calling it a political move is probably the closest, but misses the overall point.  Sure, it political.  But instead of being the politics of old, it represents the politics of unification.  It represents setting aside differences and focusing on decisions that the two conflicting sides can make without any compromise.  The right and the left can agree that there is a desperate need to deliver affordable AIDS drugs not only to people in the far reaches of Africa, but in the houses next door in Austin, Texas.  The right and left can agree that there is a desperate need to end persecution by religious groups, and persecution of religious groups.  The right and left can agree that there is a desperate need to teach people in third world countries how to farm, how to maintain livestock, and how to defend themselves from their corrupt governments.  The right and left can agree that the world is too small to sit back and idly watch class systems and poverty rip countries apart from the inside.  While we may not agree on certain social matters, the preservation of ones humanity is something that all can rally around.                      2 Comments »                                                                                                                              26                                                   12                                                   2008                                                                                                                                                               The Obama/Warren Complex, Part I                                                  Posted by:  tyroneslothrop  in  Civil Rights , tags:  Civil Rights ,  gay marriage ,  inauguration ,  obama ,  rick warren                                                           In two separate posts I will discuss Obama’s choice to invite minister Rick Warren to speak at the inauguration.   Already Obama has angered some liberals for selecting Rick Warren to speak at the inauguration festivities. Actually, he already has irritated some of his supporters by appointing intelligent thoughtful people to his cabinet instead of party hacks. Keeping Robert Gates really irked some of the more extreme members of the Democratic party, who view him simply as a retainer from a poisoned administration and not a guy whos just as willing to admit when things are going right as when things are going wrong. Obama’s promise to change Washington D.C. by including all voices was echoed by all of his supporters, but when he began to do just that, well, people began to jump ship.   I think the first thing you, dear reader, should do is read  a post written by Melissa Etheridge  concerning Obamas choice to pick Rick Warran to speak at the inauguration. She supports Obamas decision and speaks very highly of Rick Warren. The next thing you need to do is look at  the headlines concerning the President-Elects pick  at The Huffington Post. You can read them all if you want, but after skimming the headlines, I dont think youll need to read more than one or two. Youd think he had asked Pat Robertson or James Dobson. One post calls Obama a bigot, which is rather interesting given the fact that hes made his own views on the issue completely clear, and almost all of them call Warren a bigot. There are a few posts that defend Obamas pick, but most of them condemn his choice and say that Warren is a gay-bashing hater, more or less.   Well, it is understandable why so many gay rights activists and liberals are upset by Obamas pick, or to be more specific, are upset by Rick Warren in general. While no one could say that hes not a humanitarian, he certainly is a social conservative. He told Etheridge that he had a difficult time supporting Proposition 8 in California, but decided to do so because, while he thinks that everyone deserves the same civil rights as everyone else, he also believes that the institution of marriage exists between men and women, and not between members of the same sex. Many people in the gay and lesbian community view this as a tacit approval of discrimination. They see marriage as a civil right, while Warren does not. The underlying implication is that people who disapprove of a particular practice disapprove of the people who participate in that practice as well.   Conservatives have taken a different approach. As I stated, Warren and those who support Proposition 8 do not think of marriage in terms of civil rights. In fact,  a CNN exit poll  shows that African-Americans favored Proposition 8 by 70%, and Latinos by 53%. While many people have taken this as an opportunity to argue that black people are homophobes (because apparently you can tell what all black people think about homosexuality by looking at a poll concerning gay marriage, and not homosexuality specifically), what you  can  infer from the poll is that some of the people most concerned with civil rights dont view this as a civil rights issue. Conservatives (for the most part) see the institution of marriage as a privilege granted by the state that can, and should, be regulated, similar to the way in which drivers licenses are regulated.   There are those in the middle, this author included, who believe that the United States government oversteps its bounds when it involves itself in the institution of marriage. In fact, it was only a few hundred years ago that European governments began to take a roll in marriage. The governments only interest should be that only two individuals register as a union and that they are both of legal age to do so. After that, all things should be left up to whatever church the person or persons seeking marriage attend to qualify or not to qualify the relationship as a marriage.   The argument that we would be changing the definition of marriage if we were to allow homosexuals and lesbians to marry is compelling, but misguided. Marriage has gone through hundreds of changes throughout history, from polygamy (which still exists today) to monogamy, from arranged marriages to free marriages, from marrying young women to old men to making it illegal for people considered to be adults to make sexual advances on a minor. To say that codifying marriage as between one man and one woman will prevent it from ever changing is absurd.   I have a hard time saying that marriage is a civil right in the same way that blacks have the same rights as individuals as whites, or Latinos, or Koreans, or Mongolians, or whatever. I think that everyone has the right to marry who they love, but the institution of marriage is just that, an institution. If your church doesnt allow homosexuals to marry, I suggest finding another church. And if your government tells you that it has the right to decide the fates of social codes that that government has no practical interest in, I suggest you tell your government to back off and remember its place. The right to seek marriage is a fundamental right. Whether or not you  can  get married should be up to your particular denomination or faith, and not the United States government.   So where does this leave us in terms of the issue facing Obama and one of his decision to ask Warren to speak at the inauguration? Weve identified what some of the prevailing viewpoints concerning homosexual, or gay, marriage are, but does that get us any closer to deciding whether what Obama did was to be interpreted as bigoted or as an endorsement of Warrens more controversial views? In part two of this post Ill discuss what I think we should make of this Obama/Warren complex. And Ill look at some of the outlying problems that this issue drags into the light.                      1 Comment »                                                   Search                             Recent Posts              Who Is (Senator) Al Franken?

But moving on doesn't move me. I want my transcendent moment. First, it seems, I'll have to transcend my damn self.

Chance of conviction Tuesday, Feb.10: 40 percent Based on SEC investigator Helene Glotzer's testimony that she asked Martha Stewart whether she was sure that Stewart had placed her sell order with Peter Bacanovic (one of the false statement specifications), Stewart's chances of conviction rise from 30 percent to 40 percent. However, Glotzer hasn't been cross-examined yet. PRINT DISCUSS E-MAIL RSS RECOMMEND... SINGLE PAGE  Facebook MySpace  Mixx  Digg  Reddit  del.icio.us  Furl  Ma.gnolia  Sphere StumbleUpon CLOSE Martha Stewart's assistant Ann Armstrong showed no lingering distress this morning from her plum-pudding-induced breakdown yesterday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Schachter eased her back into the swing of things by having her identify a dozen phone messages. Then he returned to the events of Dec. 27, 2001. When Stewart called the office from the San Antonio airport early that afternoon, Schachter asked, did Armstrong have trouble hearing her? Did she remember Stewart saying she was having trouble hearing Armstrong? Was there any background noise on the call? To these questions, Armstrong's answer was ""no."" The prosecution has asked similar questions of every witness who spoke to Stewart that afternoonand their answers have also been ""no."" The prosecution has asked a witness who knows Peter Bacanovic and Douglas Faneuil whether she ever had any trouble distinguishing between the two on the phoneand her answer was ""no.""  Why has the prosecution asked these questions? Because, as SEC investigator Helene Glotzer would soon testify and as Stewart's attorneys have conceded, in Stewart's interview with the feds on Feb. 4, 2002, she said, incorrectly, that she placed her trade with Peter Bacanovica statement the government alleges was intentionally false and misleading. And also because, in his opening statement, Bob Morvillo suggested, implausibly, that on Dec. 27, Stewart believed she was speaking to Bacanovic instead of Faneuil. The fight over this alleged false statement won't begin until tomorrow when Morvillo crosses Glotzer. Today's first highlight was "" The Annie Incident ."" Around 5 o'clock in the afternoon on Jan. 31, 2002, Ann Armstrong testified, Martha Stewart spoke to John Savarese, her attorney at Wachtell, Lipton, for about half an hour. After she got off the phone, Armstrong continued [All italicized testimony is paraphrased], She asked me to fax John Savarese the phone messages from Wednesday, Dec. 26 through Monday, Jan. 7. Then she asked if she could see the messages. I brought the message log up on my computer. Martha came over to my computer. ... I scrolled past the messages from the 26 th  and put up the 27 th . Q: What happened after you put up the messages? A: Martha saw the message from Peter, took the mouse, put the cursor at the end of the sentence, highlighted it back to the end of Peter's name, and then started typing over it. & Q: Can you describe where Ms. Stewart and you were? A: She was sitting at my desk, and I was standing behind her. Q: What did she replace the message with?  A: 'Re imclone,' all lower case. & Q: What happened after she replaced the message? A: She instantly stood up and still standing there asked me to put it back the way it was. Then she walked over to her door and turned around and asked me to get her son-in-law on the phone. [Stewart's son-in-law is an attorney who has represented both Stewart and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. Armstrong knew this. She also considered Stewart's son-in-law a friend.] Q: When you were back at your computer, what did you do? A: I didn't know what to do. I really didn't know what to do. & Martha was on the phone with her son-in-law for 15 minutes. While she was on the phone, I added punctuation to the message to just reflexively neaten it.  Specifically, Judge Cedarbaum soon clarified, Armstrong added a colon after ""re"" and capitalized the ""I"" and ""C"" of ImClone. No wonder Stewart sent Armstrong a plum pudding for Christmas. We should all have such fanatically detail-oriented assistants. After Stewart got off the phone with her son-in-law, Armstrong testified, the son-in-law called Armstrong. He told her not to touch anything, to ""stop in her tracks,"" and asked her to meet him later to discuss what had happened. They met at a restaurant, and Armstrong told the son-in-law that she was in ""a bit of a quandary"" about getting the message back because her message-log wasn't backed up on the server. When Armstrong got home that evening, she spoke again to Stewart, who asked her whether she had been able to put the message back in its original form. She explained that she hadn't, because she couldn't remember what the original message was. Then she, Ann Armstrong, wrote in a notebook everything that had happened that day.  Ultimately, Armstrong testified, she discovered a copy of the original message on her computer because her computer had crashed and automatically saved everything. When she found the original, she faxed it to John Savarese and also sealed a copy for herself in an envelope (with a witness watching), presumably in case what is happening now happened. Let us take another moment to praise the fastidiousness and professionalism of Ann Elizabeth Armstrong. As I described in a  previous dispatch , Stewart's temporary rewriting of history was her first suspicious move. On its face, it suggests ""consciousness of guilt""why would she change the message if she didn't think she had done something wrong? In the previous dispatch, I suggested another possible motive: Her conversation with John Savarese had scared the bejeesus out of herthe government thought Sam Waksal had tipped her off about Erbitux!and she had changed the message in panic after realizing that it might help her get convicted of a crime she hadn't committed. In any case, the prosecution did not attempt to use Armstrong to comment on Stewart's motives, nor did the defense. Instead, on cross-examination, a Koala-like Bob Morvillo purred the same refrain he had used on Douglas Faneuil:  Q: Did Ms. Stewart ever come to you and ask you to lie?  A: No. Q: Did Ms. Stewart ever ask you to conceal the truth about this incident?  A: No. Q: After Ms. Stewart learned that the government was going to interview you, did she ever ask you to lie or cover up this incident?  A: No. After lunch, Ann Armstrong was gone, and Helene Glotzer, the assistant regional director with the SEC who launched the ImClone investigation, was in the witness chair. Like a previous witness, Glotzer was pregnant, but, thankfully, her baby wasn't due ""Friday."" She wore a black dress and had bushels of black hair. Glotzer testified about the SEC's interviews with Douglas Faneuil, Peter Bacanovic, and Martha Stewart in January and February 2002 (see  previous dispatches ). As expected, she testified that, in the Jan. 3 interview, Faneuil stated that, on Dec. 27, Stewart had called and asked the price of ImClone and then placed her order with him. Glotzer then testified that, in the Jan. 7 interview, Bacanovic stated that Stewart had placed the order with  him . She then testified that, in the Feb. 4 interview, Stewart had stated that she placed her order with Bacanovic. To this last assertion, she added the following: A: I asked whether she was sure she had spoken to Peter Bacanovic. She said she was sure. She said she didn't recall who his assistant was. This is new information, and it is potentially critical. If Stewart had only mentioned once that she gave her order to Bacanovic, this false statement charge would be much harder to prove (it would have been easy to make the mistake once, especially because the focus of the interview was on determining whether Stewart had been tipped off about Erbitux, not on what, if anything, Douglas Faneuil told Stewart about the Waksal sales). The fact that Glotzer said that she specifically challenged Stewart about this statement and received the same incorrect answer, however, makes the assertion look intentional. This Glotzer recollection, in fact, may be why, in his opening statement, Morvillo suggested that Stewart thought she was talking to Bacanovic instead of Faneuil. If Stewart's team has to rely on such an implausible defense to this charge, however, she could be in trouble. Glotzer testified to Stewart's other alleged false statements in the Feb. 4 interview. She also testified that Stewart said that when her bookkeeper, Heidi DeLuca, was gathering documents to help Stewart prepare for the interview, she recalled the $60 conversation about ImClone. According to Stewart (Glotzer said), this meant that Stewart, Peter Bacanovic, and DeLuca all recalled the conversation the same way. This answer surprised the investigators, Glotzer said, because Stewart had just told them that she and Bacanovic hadn't spoken about the investigation or ImClone (another alleged false statement). When challenged on this point, Glotzer said, Stewart modified her answer, saying that she didn't know what Bacanovic's recollection was. Although I imagine that, on cross-examination, Morvillo will be able to suggest that Glotzer's memory is even more human than Douglas Faneuil's, this story certainly explains why the government thinks Stewart is full of it. Peter Bacanovic's attorney, Richard Strassberg, got first crack at Glotzer. First, he attacked her motives: The SEC and Glotzer had invested two years in this investigation, the government's reputation was on the line, Glotzer's reputation was on the line, Glotzer's colleagues (and bosses) were watching & and Glotzer, therefore, presumably wanted to be as ""helpful"" to the government's case as possible. Second, Strassberg went after Glotzer's credibilitywhich, because of the circumstances, was a fat target. These conversations had taken place two years ago, after all, and there were no tapes of them, nor transcripts of any kind. Strassberg quickly got Glotzer to say that she hadn't even taken any notes at the meetings; that, in preparation for her testimony, she had looked at a colleague's notes. And then there were all the other conversations Glotzer had had in the last two years: Would it be fair to say, Ms. Glotzer,  Richard Strassberg said, using his signature cross-examination phrasing,  that you've had thousands of conversations pertaining to the ImClone investigation in the last two years? Would it be fair to say that ImClone is not the only case you worked on? Would it be fair to say, Ms. Glotzer, that you've had hundreds if not thousands of conversations about other investigations over the last two years? Would it also be fair to say that you've had thousands of conversations about other things in the last two years? Yes, I hope so,  Helene Glotzer said, after answering ""yes"" in one form or another to the other questions as well. Then, on behalf of his client, Peter Bacanovic, Richard Strassberg started in on the specifics:  Q: Ms. Glotzer, would you agree with me that sometimes, when you say, ""we,"" you don't always mean ""you""? A: Yes, I sometimes use ""we"" to describe my staff. Q: And would you also agree with me, Ms. Glotzer, that you sometimes use ""we"" to describe a whole bunch of stuff the SEC does, and not just you personally? A: It's possible. Q: And, Ms. Glotzer, would you agree with me that it's actually commonplace to say ""we""that it's not just you who does this. A: Yes. Having made this point, Strassberg moved in for the kill:  Share this article on Digg Share this article on Buzz Q: Ms. Glotzer, you testified on direct that you understood that Peter Bacanovic said he had spoken to Martha Stewart on Dec. 27 and taken her order. You also testified that you had just heard four days before that that Douglas Faneuil had said that  he  had taken Ms. Stewart's orderbut you didn't ask a follow-up question. Is that correct, Ms. Glotzer?  A: That's correct. Strassberg then said that, at multiple points in the SEC's later interview with Peter Bacanovic (Feb. 13)an event that, unlike the other interviews, was both taped and transcribedthe government phrased questions as, ""What did  you  do?"" while Bacanovic phrased his responses as, ""this is what  we  did."" After Judge Cedarbaum had dismissed the jury, Strassberg argued that, at one point in the tape, Bacanovic had said ""we,"" and the transcripta transcript that Helene Glotzer had personally approvedhad said ""I.""  If the judge allows Strassberg to have his way, we'll all hear the tape and see the (erroneous) transcript tomorrow morning. This afternoon, though, the message we all heard was this: The government is trying to send Peter Bacanovic to prison, in part, over what, in the Jan. 7 interview, apparently amounts to the unrecorded, un-transcribed use of a disputed pronoun.  dispatches from the martha stewart trial: entries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The ""Annie Incident"" and the Royal ""We"" By Henry Blodget Posted Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2004, at 11:02 PM ET PRINT E-MAIL RECOMMEND...

Warren was a supporter of California’s Proposition 8, an initiative that rescinded marriage rights for same-sex couples.

President-elect Barack Obama's selection of Warren to deliver the inaugural prayer has generated intense scrutiny of the pastor's beliefs on social issues, from his vocal support for Proposition 8, a ballot initiative banning same-sex marriage in California, to his comparison of homosexuality to pedophilia, incest and bestiality. Many of Obama's supporters have demanded that he withdraw the invitation. Warren's defense against charges of intolerance ultimately depends upon his ace card: his heavily publicized crusade against AIDS in Africa. Obama senior adviser David Axelrod cited Warren's work in Africa as one of ""the things on which [Obama and Warren] agree"" on the Dec. 28 episode of Meet the Press. Warren may be opposed to gay rights and abortion, the thinking goes, but he tells evangelicals it is their God-given duty to battle one of the greatest pandemics in history. What could be wrong with that? But since the Warren inauguration controversy erupted, the nature of his work against AIDS in Africa has gone unexamined. Warren has not been particularly forthcoming ...    more   »                  Leave Comment   |            Permanent Link     |   Cosmos                          Sunday, December 21               Inauguration Day Protest - Join the Impact - White Knot Protest       by        Radio Left    on Sun 21 Dec 2008 06:41 PM CST        In the face of this egregious error in judgment by the President -Elect and his transition team, I do believe that our community cannot leave the Rick Warren issue un-commented in the Public Forum of Ideas. Many actions are currently underway to protest the decision to have Rick Warren on the Inaugural platform, and most of them are lobbying and petition-based strategies, which may not be visible to the public-at-large. LIGHT UP THE NIGHT Events to be held today, which were to bring the Rick Warren issue to the public, may not happen in all areas of the country as originally planned, due to the severe weather conditions that have left large potions of the Northeast and Mid-states buried in snow. A great teaching opporunity missed due to Mother Nature; But she might be wise in having us stay our hands. A suggestion for wide distribution and consideration: BRING THE WHITE KNOT CAMPAIGN TO THE INAUGURATION. As many here within JTI are offended by the symbolism of having such a hate-monger as Rick Warren being given a National platform with the seeming approval of the Nation's new leader, I do believe that a silent eloquent SYMBOL of Our commitment to ...    more   »                  Leave Comment   |            Permanent Link     |   Cosmos                         Latest News - Equality California ED Geoff Kors does the right thing and declines invitation to Obama inauguration       by        Radio Left    on Sun 21 Dec 2008 06:35 PM CST        December 17, 2008  EQCA Executive Director turns down invitation to Presidential Inauguration In declining his invitation to attend inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama because of Rev. Rick Warren giving the invocation, EQCA Executive Director Geoff Kors released the following statement: It is extremely disappointing and hurtful that President-elect Obama has chosen California Rev. Rick Warren, who actively supported Prop 8 and the elimination of existing civil rights for LGBT Californians, to give the invocation at his inauguration.  Accordingly, I have decided to decline the invitation to attend the inauguration as I cannot be part of a celebration that highlights and gives voice to someone who advocated repealing rights from me and millions of other Californians.  I was looking forward to hearing a speech by the new President about his vision of a new America and an end to the politics of division where one group is pitted against another.  Rick Warren does not share that vision. Far from it. Instead, he actively works to divide Americans based on who we are and has been an ardent supporter of efforts to ostracize LGBT Americans.  It would be impossible for me to attend the Inauguration where a person who has worked to ...    more   »                  Leave Comment   |            Permanent Link     |   Cosmos                         The Lead: Episcopal Bishop of Washington decries selection of Warren to give inaugural invocation       by        Radio Left    on Sun 21 Dec 2008 06:32 PM CST        Statement by Right Reverend John Bryson Chane, Episcopal Bishop of Washington I am profoundly disappointed by President-elect Barack Obama’s decision to invite Pastor Rick Warren of Saddleback Church to offer the invocation at his inauguration. The president-elect has bestowed a great honor on a man whose recent comments suggest he is both homophobic, xenophobic, and willing to use the machinery of the state to enforce his prejudices—even going so far as to support the assassination of foreign leaders.  In his home state of California, Mr. Warren’s campaigned aggressively to deny gay and lesbian couples equal rights under the law, relying on arguments that are both morally offensive and theologically crude. Christian leaders differ passionately with one another over the morality of same-sex relationships, but only the most extreme liken the loving, lifelong partnerships of their fellow citizens to incest and pedophilia, as Mr. Warren has done. The president-elect’s willingness to associate himself with a man who espouses these views as a means of reaching out to religious conservatives suggests a willingness to use the aspirations of gay and lesbian Americans as bargaining chips, and I find this deeply troubling. Mr. Warren has been rightly praised for his efforts to deepen ...    more   »                  Leave Comment   |            Permanent Link     |   Cosmos                         This is what B. H.

By and large, the meme has been blown out of proportion, as the press overestimated how divisive Obama's cabinet choices were for progressives.    The press may now have its conflict moment. And it comes in the form of the spiritual leader chosen to launch Obama's inauguration.    On Wednesday, the transition team and Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies announced that Rick Warren, pastor of the powerful Saddleback Church, would give the invocation on January 20th. The selection may not have been incredibly surprising. Obama and Warren are reportedly close -- Obama praised the Megachurch leader in his second book ""The Audacity of Hope."" Warren, meanwhile, hosted a values forum between Obama and McCain during the general election. Nevertheless, the announcement is being greeted with deep skepticism in progressive religious and political circles.    ""My blood pressure is really high right now,"" said Rev. Chuck Currie, minister at Parkrose Community United Church of Christ in Portland, Oregon. ""Rick Warren does some really good stuff and there are some areas that I have admired his ability to build bridges between evangelicals and mainline religious and political figures... but he is also very established in the religious right and his position on social issues like gay rights, stem cell research and women's rights are all out of the mainstream and are very much opposed to the progressive agenda that Obama ran on. I think that he is very much the wrong person to put on the stage with the president that day.""    Warren does have a rather peculiar relationship with the incoming president. The two share a general ethos that political differences should not serve as impediments to progress. On topics like AIDS and poverty relief, they see eye-to-eye. But Warren's domestic and social agendas are at odds with Obama's. And for the gay and lesbian community in particular, the choice is a bitter pill to swallow.     ""Pastor Warren, while enjoying a reputation as a moderate based on his affable personality and his church's engagement on issues like AIDS in Africa, has said that the real difference between James Dobson and himself is one of tone rather than substance,""  read a statement  from People For the American Way President Kathryn Kolbert. ""He has repeated the Religious Right's big lie that supporters of equality for gay Americans are out to silence pastors.  He has called Christians who advance a social gospel Marxists. He is adamantly opposed to women having a legal right to choose an abortion.""    ""Picking Rick Warren to give THE invocation,""  wrote John Aravosis on AmericaBlog , ""is abominable.""    ""Let me get right to the point,"" Joe Solomnese, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a harsh letter to the president-elect, ""Your invitation to Reverend Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at your inauguration is a genuine blow to LGBT Americans.""       Story continues below           advertisement        Added Rev. Candace Chellew-Hodge, author of the book: ""Bulletproof Faith: A Spiritual Survival Guide for Gay and Lesbian Christians"": ""It is almost like he wants to poke the progressives with a sharp stick.""    Indeed, Chellew-Hodge and others see the move as motivated by politics, not religion or policy. They offer several explanations in this vein. Obama has his eye on the evangelical vote (young white evangelicals  voted for Obama  at twice the rate for John Kerry); he is charting a path that isn't at its heart socially or religiously progressive (Chellew-Hodge noted that Warren recently said same-sex couples deserve equal rights, though not the right to marriage, a position at least superficially similar to Obama's). Mainly, however, the argument is that the Warren choice falls under the president-elect's stated objective of building a big tent government.    ""I can't read the transition team's mind,"" said Dan Nejfelt, a spokesman for the group, Faith In Public Life, ""but my guess here is that they're crafting an inauguration meant to appeal to voters who voted against Obama as well as his supporters.""    Indeed, lost in the hubbub about Warren, is  the fact that the man tasked  with overseeing the benediction is a icon within progressive politics. Rev. Joe Lowery, a hero of the civil rights movement and co-founder of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Martin Luther King famously called out President George W. Bush during Coretta Scott King's funeral. He also is a supporter of same-sex marriage. But he is not garnering the same attention as Warren for his inauguration role.    It's vintage Obama, several observers say -- bringing the spectrum of the religious/political experience together for one event. And yet, it is also a big source of frustration for progressive leaders, many of whom aren't interested in legitimizing viewpoints antithetical to their message.    ""I think there is probably an actual friendship between the two, and I admire that because Barack Obama has an ability to be friends with people he disagrees with, and that is a good quality for a president,"" said Rev. Currie. ""But I think that he is very much the wrong person to put on the stage with the president that day. It sends a very wrong message about who America is and what our aspirations are.""    Requests for a comment from the Obama transition team went un-returned.

Jonathan Handel: Why Obama Picked Rick                                                                                                                                                                          For a good ten minutes, I puzzled over why Obama would select an anti-gay conservative preacher, Rick Warren, to give his invocation speech. Several reasons occurred to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Leah McElrath Renna: Rick Warren, Obama? Really?!?!                                                                                                                                                                          The message for American gay men and lesbians in the choice of Rick Warren is that -- once again -- ""everyone"" means everyone but us.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Lee Stranahan: Embrace What You Have In Common With Rick Warren                                                                                                                                                                          There's something bigger at play here and you can't say Obama didn't warn you. He talked about reaching out, about expanding our politics and that crazy bastard actually meant it.

This is a troubling sign for a president elected to be a new kind of leader.

The choice of Warren underscores the fact that no openly-LGBT person has been selected to take part in the Inaugural ceremony, or be named to any level of Obama's White House staff.

So why one who spoke out so publicly in support of Prop 8. Why re-open painful wounds?

This choice illustrates the downside of inspirational figures and the accompanying bad habit of investing in Obama your own ideas, values, priorities and views just because he moves you.

Read his full-disclosure statement about his potential conflicts of interest in covering the Martha Stewart trial  here . For a complete listing of Blodget's dispatches, see  Slate 's Guide to the Martha Stewart Trial , which also has links to related  Slate  articles. Stewart: Plum pudding ... then stock plunder? One common mistake in business is the tendency to judge decisions by what happens after they are made. Everything is obvious in hindsight, and knowing what happened makes it too easy to go back and confidently separate information from noise. If ImClone's stock had risen after Martha Stewart sold it, we might now consider her Dec. 27 sale premature and/or dismiss Sam Waksal's attempt to sell some of his own shares as immaterial. Because Waksal's attempted sale was followed by bad news and a tanking stock, however, we now regard it as an obvious sell signal. But to evaluate the propriety of Stewart's trade, we have to analyze not what she and the market knew 36 hours later (that the FDA would reject ImClone's cancer drug Erbitux), or several months later (confirmation that Waksal had, in fact, idiotically tried to dump stock before the news was made public), but what they knew at the time of the trade.

SINGLE PAGE  Facebook MySpace  Mixx  Digg  Reddit  del.icio.us  Furl  Ma.gnolia  Sphere StumbleUpon CLOSE The story began in October 2001, when the pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb made a tender offer to buy 14.4 million shares of ImClone at $70 per share. Martha Stewart, who had owned ImClone for several years, ""tendered"" all 5,000 of her shares. As it happened, the tender offer was so oversubscribed that Bristol-Myers could buy only 21 percent of the tendered shares, leaving Stewart with 3,928 shares. Around this time, in a then-unrelated event, ImClone filed an application with the FDA requesting a review of Erbitux, a key new cancer drug. The FDA had 60 days to respond. Approximately 50 days later, on Dec. 20   or 21, Stewart's financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, Peter Bacanovic, printed a list of the stocks in Stewart's portfolio for a standard year-end review. This list, which provided details about each position, was titled ""Unrealized Gain/(Loss) Summary by Security."" The markets had been crushed in 2001, for the second straight year, so Stewart, like most investors, had opportunities to engage in ""tax-loss selling""ditching stocks that have lost money to offset gains on those that have made money, thus reducing that year's capital gains tax. On the phone, Stewart and Bacanovic reviewed the portfolio stock by stock, with Bacanovic making notes on the ""Unrealized Gain/(Loss)"" sheet with a blue ballpoint pen. When they got to the 18 th  stock on the list, ImClone, then trading in the low $60s, Bacanovic recommended that Stewart sell it. Stewart rejected the suggestion, but contends (as does Bacanovic) that they agreed that, if the stock ever fell to $60, she would sell it then. (The prosecution contends that the ""$60 agreement"" is a fabrication.) Over the next two days, Bacanovic executed tax-loss selling for Stewart in 22 stocks. Waksal: Sins of the father? One week later, on Dec. 27, Peter Bacanovic was on vacation in Miami, and Martha Stewart was flying to Mexico for a vacation. Between 9 and 10 a.m., Bacanovic's assistant at Merrill Lynch, Douglas Faneuil, received a request from the daughter of ImClone's CEO, Sam Waksal, to sell all of the ImClone stock in her account (39,472 shares, which netted approximately $2.5 million). Faneuil also received a written request from Sam Waksal to transfer all of the ImClone stock in  his  account (79,797 shares worth approximately $4.9 million) to his daughter's account. The request was marked ""URGENTIMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED."" Faneuil then received a call from Waksal's accountant, who requested that all of the transferred stock be sold. Merrill Lynch, treating the transferred shares as though they were still Sam Waksal's, refused to sell them without permission from ImClone's general counsel.  Around 10 a.m., Faneuil told Bacanovic about Waksal's daughter's sale and Waksal's attempted sale (and, presumably, about other ImClone information, as described below). Shortly thereafter, at 10:04, with ImClone trading at approximately $61.50, Bacanovic and Faneuil called Martha Stewart's office. Bacanovic left a message that Stewart's assistant, Ann Armstrong, recorded as ""Peter Bacanovic thinks ImClone is going to start trading downward.""  Share this article on Digg Share this article on Buzz Three hours later, at 1:26 p.m. ET, Stewart's private jet landed in San Antonio, Texas, to refuel. From the tarmac, Stewart made three calls on her cell phone: a one-minute call to her home answering machine (1:30 to 1:31); an 11-minute call to her office (1:31 to 1:41), near the end of which she was transferred to Bacanovic's office; and a two-minute call to ImClone's offices (1:41 to 1:43). During the call to her office, Stewart discussed business matters and phone messages with Armstrong. That day's messages included not only Bacanovic's, but a note of thanks for a plum pudding (""excellent""), an inquiry as to whether someone ""could be on your helicopter to the boat,"" a request to confirm a new date for the opening of a shopping center, and a request for information about ""4 tabletop lamps and chaise longue."" At 1:39, Armstrong patched Stewart through to Bacanovic's office and hung up.  Bacanovic was in Miami, so the 27-year-old Faneuil took the call. According to the prosecution, Faneuil told Stewart about the Waksal sale attempt. (Faneuil would later say that he told her this because Bacanovic told him to; Stewart hasn't denied receiving the information, but she hasn't confirmed it, either.) While allegedly knowing about Waksal's attempted sale, a fact that the U.S. attorney and the SEC contend was ""material nonpublic information,"" Stewart told Faneuil to sell the rest of her ImClone stock. Then, at 1:41 p.m., two minutes after being transferred to Faneuil, she hung up. Merrill Lynch completed her sell order shortly thereafter, at an average sale price of about $58.  Because the two-minute Stewart-Faneuil conversation is criticalboth to assessing the propriety of the trade and to the arguments of the prosecution and defenseit needs to be considered in detail. Before we do this, however, we need to review what else was happening that morninga subject to which I will return in my next dispatch. dispatches from the martha stewart trial: entries 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 The Trade By Henry Blodget Posted Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2003, at 5:36 PM ET PRINT E-MAIL RECOMMEND...

COMMENTS Remarks from the Fray:  Prosecution could have brought attention to insider trading without a full blown witch hunt attitude. Martha may have had sweet deals whispered in her ears and responded but isn't that more common than we would like to admit? Since she is not being charged with the insider trading the decision to charge her for an obscure related crime is probably not a good idea. Martha should have spilled the beans immediately as the amount we are talking about is minuscule to her wealth but there was more at stake in poor publicity so she made a serious mistake in judgment. Charge her for being stupid so everyone can move on. That mistake empowered the government and the SEC who were under staggering pressure from the Enron situations to go for the throat of someone, or anyone but should they have picked Martha? I think the answer is no simply because instead of exonerating the SEC and government, it only spotlights the weakness of the enforcements and laws. The Ken Lay's of the CEO world walking around after cheating people of millions if not billions simply because no provable law has been broken becomes highlighted by the pack attack of one woman being destroyed with something akin to joy... --Meta4 (To reply, click  here ) While I agree that there are parts of the case against Martha that are hard to understand, Blodget's theorizing on her behalf seems quite implausible. Sure, it was possible that Stewart and her brokers discussed the sale without transmitting any material nonpublic information. But think about it: Why would she buy shares in Waksal's company using Waksal's own broker, and call that very broker about selling decisions, if she didn't hope to get inside information?  For Stewart to be innocent, the call would have to go something like this: ""Douglas, this is Martha. Before you say anything, shut up and listen. You know I'm calling about ImClone. I know that you are Sam's personal broker. This means that you must be very careful not to divulge any material information you have learned from Sam, not even in a wink-wink-nudge-nudge way, because then I might be guilty of insider trading. Instead, I want you to pretend you are not Sam's broker, and please give me only publicly available information. Oh, and please don't think it's strange that I'm calling you about selling at 59 after having previously instructed you to sell at 60.""

Stop worrying about little battles, you just won a war. It's all about real results now, not words, and not symbols. It is time to think like winners.

It's truly unbelievable.  Via Jed: Via John Aravosis at AMERICAblog, Rick Warren is doubling down and accusing his critics of ""hate-speech"" and ""Christophobia."" Rachel Maddow has the video, and takes Warren to task for the hypocrisy of saying that it's unfair to call his views hateful while simultaneously accusing his critics of hate speech. Moreover, as Rachel notes, Warren flat-out lies about his comments comparing gay marriage to pedophilia and incest.  Setting aside Warren's role as inaugural invocation speaker (for a brief moment), I don't think there's any way to defend what he is now saying. I accept the proposition that it's possible to disagree on the issue of gay marriage without calling someone names. But there's really no comparison between gay marriage and incest or pedophilia, and if Warren thinks they are equivalent, he's either a fan of incest and pedophilia, or he has serious problem with gay people. And calling his critics ""Christophobes"" just makes matters worse. A simple apology from Warren for having made the comparison probably would have made this whole controversy go away. But now he's doubling down, and it's just making matters worse.read more | digg story                                                                             Vodpod will be down for maintenance from 7:00PM PST to 10:00PM PST on Sunday, January 18th.

Although radio is the most widespread medium of communication in the country, many Kenyans witnessed this historic moment through the medium of television. By the time the results were finally announced, many had been glued to television sets since before dawn, watching the results on live feeds from  CNN ,  BBC  World Service,  MSNBC  and Al Jazeera English.      Celebrations immediately broke out across the East African nation that, eight months earlier, had suffered through two months of post-election violence that left at least 1,200 people dead and another 350,000 displaced. And nowhere was the celebrating more passionate than in southwestern Kenya, home of Obama father Luo tribe. For the many Luos who danced through villages, towns and the streets of the regional capital Kisumu as they waved traditional celebratory tree branches, the moment was especially sweet; they are convinced that their own presidential candidate, Raila Odinga, was cheated out of victory in the Dec. 27, 2007 presidential election.       Scores of local and international journalists were positioned outside Kogelo, the tiny village in Siaya district that is home to Sarah Onyango Obama, Obama grandmother. There, family members had been gathering for days amid the media onslaught. Following the Luo celebratory tradition, several black bulls were roasted for a victory feast. About a week before the election, the Kenyan government had graded the road leading to the house, and workers from the Kenya Power & Lighting Company were busily running the first electric wires in the villager the surrounding regiono the house. The police were also building a station nearby intended to provide round-the-clock surveillance.      The newspapers that went to press Nov. 5, when the polls had been open for just a few hours in the United States, carried optimistic headlines: span class=""caps"">OBAMA,said The Standard; bama Leads,said The Daily Nation. The following day, The Standard bannered he Obama Sensation,while The Daily Nation went with he First Family: How Obama Won by a Landslide.Both newspapers were packed with Obama-related stories from agencies and Kenyan correspondents in the U.S. There were also full-page ads from local businesses such as Telkom Kenya, which trumpeted the Kiswahili phrase ongera Rais Barack Obama,meaning ongratulations, President Barack Obama.     East African Breweries, whose down-market Senator beer had been affectionately dubbed bamaby hundreds of thousands of drinkers, launched a special edition President brew for the occasion.

Really?        by Jeremy Freed                   TOPICS       Civil Rights Election 2008                                 The Obama Presidency has hit its first snag, and it hasn't even officially begun yet.     Last week, it was announced that the evangelical preacher Rick Warren would be on hand to give the invocation at the inauguration next month. The choice of Warren, whose wildly successful book,  The Purpose Driven Life,  has made him a celebrity in evangelical circles, is now being criticized because of the preacher's stance on gay marriage.    While Obama himself has never come out explicitly in favor of gay marriage, his selection of a man who  likened same-sex unions to child abuse and incest  hardly seems the ideal way to begin a presidency founded on hope and change. To many, it seems like the first faltering step of a too-good-to-be-true candidacy.     I won't be the first to say this, but now may be a good time to re-examine our vision of Barack Obama as the savior of America. Certainly, a superhero is just what America needs right now, but it may be time to accept that Obama won't be able to be all things to all people. He still has the potential to be as good for America as he promised, but this first misstep is an early indication of the tough road he has ahead of him.    In Obama's Rick Warren decision, those on the left who favor gay marriage will be upset by the honoring of someone who has spoken so hatefully about gays. The hardline evangelicals will not be moved into Obama's camp, either, because of his position in favor of abortion, probably their most significant issue. Those in the middle, who are neither rabid on the issue of gay marriage nor vociferously against abortion, will be fine with this—but isn't it a bit late to be reaching out to the undecided?    Rick Warren's statements about gays and gay marriage are shameful, and have no place in 21st century American politics. After all, is likening gays to pedophiles any different from the slurs that were once made by some preachers against African Americans to keep them from attaining civil rights?    Perhaps Obama is trying to be inclusive with this choice, and he certainly can't be blamed for trying to bring Americans together—it will be one of the most important tasks of his administration. But it will not be easy, especially when so many of them insist on clinging to fear and hatred under the guise of Christianity.

After exhaustively reporting on the  impending sale — and possible shutdown — of the Rocky Mountain News  last month, Denver’s alternative weekly Westword turns a spotlight on itself, writing in blog posts that  three staffers were laid off Monday  and top brass at parent company Village Voice Media (VVM) are taking 10 percent to 15 percent pay cuts.                   Rocky spikes column asking if Feds might intervene to prevent shutdown          By  Ernest Luning  1/6/09 5:12 PM     Rocky Mountain News  contributor Jason Salzman  wrote in a column for the newspaper last week that “putting the Rocky on the market for one month over the holidays looks like its not a good-faith effort to find a buyer for the newspaper.” But the observation  didn’t appear in the Rocky because editor and publisher John Temple rejected the column , Salzman says in a blog post Tuesday. It’s the first time in more than four years the Rocky has refused one of his biweekly “On the Media” columns, Salzman writes.                   Carbondale newspaper shuts down ‘for the unforeseeable future’          By  Ernest Luning  12/30/08 9:05 AM     Citing “the current economic situation,” Carbondale’s 34-year-old weekly newspaper, The Valley Journal, announced on Christmas Day it would cease publication. An editorial told readers to look for local news in other publications owned by Gypsum-based Colorado Mountain News Media (CMNM), including the daily Glenwood Springs Post Independent and the Aspen Times. “It is definitely not [...]                   Insider offers encouraging ideas for a battered, bruised news industry          By  Wendy Norris  12/18/08 12:07 PM     It’s been an especially tough year for the  news industry, which is suffering mass layoffs, sales and bankruptcy  filings by some of the biggest companies in print and broadcast journalism.   But all is not lost says Reuter’s Chris Cramer at the  Global Forum for Media Development . Andrew Lam writes the following from rough notes taken at the discussion and posted at the  New America Media blog :                   Rocky Mountain News staffers take to Web in effort to save newspaper          By  Ernest Luning  12/15/08 10:04 AM     A Web site aimed at keeping the Rocky Mountain News alive launched Sunday night as part of a campaign by the newspaper’s staff to rally public support a week after  E.W. Scripps Co. put the Denver daily up for sale  and said it could cease publication if no buyer emerges. The  IWantMyRocky.com  site urges readers to share memories and propose methods to keep the 149-year-old newspaper  Colorado’s oldest business  from closing. “We meet in this strange place in a noble effort to save the Rocky Mountain News,” Rocky columnist Mike Littwin writes. “And if we cant save the Rocky, we can, at minimum, make some noise before we go.”                   Politicker.com shuts down Colorado, 11 other state sites, lays off reporters          By  Ernest Luning  12/12/08 11:37 AM     Twelve Politicker political news sites around the country, including  PolitickerCO.com  in Colorado, were shut down and their reporters unexpectedly laid off Friday morning. The sites, billed as “Inside politics for political insiders,” covered news in 17 states around the country, are owned by the  Observer Media Group , based in New York.

Denver Post owner begs to differ with credit downgrade, Tribune comparison          By  Ernest Luning  12/11/08 6:22 PM     The parent company of the Denver Post disputed a report Thursday afternoon that followed Moody’s Investors Services downgrade of its credit rating to one suggesting “a substantial risk” of default. An Editor & Publisher article noted that  MediaNews Group’s debt-to-earning ratio was almost as high as that carried by the Tribune Co. , which filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday, but the privately held MediaNews Group said the comparison failed to take numerous factors into account and insisted the company wasn’t in danger.                   Singleton memo: Post blindsided by Rocky sale, ‘first step’ to closure          By  Ernest Luning  12/5/08 7:57 AM     The owner of the Rocky Mountain News notified the owner of the Denver Post it “planned to close the Rocky Mountain News as soon as practical” more than two weeks ago, The Post’s owner, Dean Singleton, wrote in a memo on Thursday. Earlier that day, the Rocky’s owner, E.W. Scripps Co.,  announced its newspaper was for sale . “As you know,” Singleton wrote in the memo, “an announced sale is usually the first step leading to a failing newspapers closure.”                   Analyst: Give the Rocky Mountain News 90 days, then it’s gone          By  Ernest Luning  12/4/08 7:31 PM     The announcement Thursday that  Denver’s Rocky Mountain News is on the block  for the next 30 days starts a clock ticking that will “almost certainly” lead to the  149-year-old newspaper shutting down in 90 days , writes Alan D. Mutter, who blogs about the news business in Reflections of a Newsosaur.

The head of Cincinnati-based E.W. Scripps, the  Rocky 's owner, acknowledged in making the announcement Thursday that if a buyer does not step forward in the next four to six weeks that the paper could be closed - a move that could occur as soon as early 2009.    ""We're not here today to close the paper,"" Rich Boehne, president and chief executive of Scripps, told staffers gathered in the newsroom late Thursday morning. ""We're here today to say the status quo is not going to work.""    Scripps expects the  Rocky  to lose $15 million this year, Boehne said.    ""It's too early to write the obituary of the  Rocky Mountain News  - way, way too early,"" said Mark Contreras, senior vice president of the newspaper division for Scripps.    The paper is caught in a complex and fast-changing media world and a crumbling economy that has seen newsrooms across the nation decimated in recent months. Just this week, Gannett Co. Inc., the country's largest newspaper company, began a round of layoffs expected to eliminate at least 2,000 jobs at its 85 U.S. newspapers. And nearly every large paper in the country has laid off workers in 2007 and 2008.    The  Rocky  and its rival,  The Denver Post , have struggled with sagging income - including the loss of an estimated $100 million in classified advertisement revenues. Although the two papers are separately owned and competitive, they are partners in a third company, the Denver Newspaper Agency, which handles the business operations of both publications.    Profit sharing    That company returns any profits to Scripps and to  The Post 's owner, MediaNews Group.    At the  Rocky , the costs of operating the newsroom are expected to be about $22 million this year, but Scripps' share of the agency's profit is not projected to be more than $7 million, based on the company's estimate of its losses.    ""We left open the possibility of Scripps buying  The Post  if they wanted to be here more than us,"" MediaNews CEO Dean Singleton told the  Rocky . ""But it became clear some time ago Scripps lost its stomach for newspapering in Denver, and we'd end up the last man standing here.""    But Boehne said there had not been any substantive negotiations over the sale of  The Post  between Scripps and MediaNews.    ""There's been no serious offer,"" Boehne said.    The  Rocky , founded in 1859, has a circulation of 210,000 daily and 457,000 on Saturday and has 232 newsroom employees. The 2001 joint operating agreement ended a long and heated newspaper war with the  Post .    Boehne said that the company had considered the idea of shutting the paper down, but decided the best course was to try to identify ""someone else with capital or money or a different view of the market than we do.""    Scripps, which has hired New York-based investment banker Broadwater & Associates, said it would entertain offers through the middle of January.    One possible buyer is Media News, but Singleton said under that scenario the  Rocky  would be shuttered.    ""We have a right of first refusal on the  News  and its 50 percent of the Denver Newspaper Agency,"" Singleton said. ""We certainly want the 50 percent of the agency, but we would not publish the  News .""    Singleton's company is also heavily leveraged and facing its own financial challenges.    Observers questioned whether a buyer would emerge, given the industry's struggles and the harsh economic climate.    ""It's a terrible time to be trying to sell a newspaper,"" said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank in St. Petersburg, Fla. ""There might be some potential buyers, but they might have a hard time getting credit. A couple of years ago I would've said there was a very high chance that Media News would buy it, but they are too stretched right now.""    Michael Howard, who joined the  Rocky  as a reporter in 1965 and served as editor of the paper from 1974 to 1980, said he doesn't ""know anyone dumb enough to buy a newspaper right now.""    Howard, a descendent of the Howard family that formed half of the former Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, doubted a sale would be successful. He said he believes it was ""inevitable we were headed toward a one-newspaper town. It's very sad.""    The announcement left staffers in stunned silence Thursday morning at the  Rocky , a paper that has won four Pulitzer Prizes in the past eight years.    ""The next six weeks or so are going to be really awful,"" Boehne said. ""We've thrown terrible uncertainty into your lives. It'll be confusing.  It's just going to be a really, really difficult period for the next month to six weeks.    ""For that, I truly and deeply apologize.""    Challenges nothing new    John Temple, the  Rocky 's editor, publisher and president, said the paper had ""faced enormous challenges many times over the course of its life.""    He noted that Scripps opened its first paper in Denver in 1906 and folded that publication into the  Rocky  when it purchased it in 1926. In 1942, he said, the paper was on the ropes before then-editor Jack Foster converted it to a reader-friendly tabloid and saw its circulation double in five years.    ""This is a day I never wanted to see come, and I am very sorry we have arrived at this point,"" Temple said. ""I wish I'd known what I could have done to avoid this day.""    In 1993 ""everyone thought the  New York Post  would die"" but 15 years later, as a part of Rupert Murdoch's empire, it is a ""vital and vibrant part of the community"" of New York, he said.    Scripps board member Nackey Scagliotti cited ""deep concern from the board and from the Scripps family about the hard- working people in the  Rocky  newsroom.""    ""We're proud of the work you do,"" Scagliotti said, ""and as Rich said, it's premature to write the obituary of the  Rocky Mountain News . We hope somebody comes forward and continues the long- standing journalistic tradition.""    Boehne said the Scripps board began serious discussions in August about the future of the  Rocky , given the rapidly deteriorating business climate for newspapers. On Tuesday, the board approved a plan to put the paper up for sale.    What happens next was the source of rampant speculation Thursday. Boehne said a number of potential buyers had approached Scripps over the years.    ""We've never been interested,"" Boehne said. ""This was absolutely unthinkable just a short time ago.""    Asked what was a best-case scenario for the paper, Boehne answered ""that somebody says, 'I have always wanted to own the  Rocky Mountain News  and this is my opportunity to do it.' ""    And the worst case? ""Worst case is we're back here talking about severance,"" he said.            Business to continue as usual     With the  Rocky  for sale, readers are sure to have questions. Harry Whipple, president and CEO of the Denver Newspaper Agency, on Thursday maintained it's business as usual.    The DNA handles circulation and advertising for the  Rocky  and  The Denver Post , the city's two largest daily newspapers. The agency was formed in 2001 under a joint operating agreement between the owners of the two newspapers. It is a 50-50 partnership between MediaNews Group, owner of  The Post , and E.W. Scripps, which owns the  Rocky . Its profits are shared equally by the two parties.    How long will the  Rocky Mountain News  be published?    I know as much as I can see from the press release that the newspaper is up for sale. I see no reason why the newspaper wouldn't be published.    Are you gathering new subscribers to the  Rocky  and what are you telling potential subscribers about Thursday's announcement?    Nothing has changed. We are marketing the newspaper as we have in the past. And we will continue to do so until something changes. Whatever the owners of the newspaper wish to say and have to say, they do - just as they did today.    What would happen to existing subscribers if the newspaper finds no buyer and eventually folds?    I don't know that the newspaper will fold. What was announced is that it's up for sale. Speculating on anything else would be premature. Any number of scenarios could come out of this.    What are the advertisers being told?    We are marketing as usual. The announcement was made by E.W. Scripps company with their intentions. We continue as if nothing has changed in terms of audiences, circulation and sales approach.

Just too much nonsensical, liberal, unsubstantiated  rhetoric from a newspaper to continue supporting the rmn.  I'm thinking this is occuring for just this reason.  Thousands of subscriptions dropped in the last year, hence the $11M loss in the last three quarters.    I feel bad cause the rmn was always somewhat of an icon 'til the media bias took over.  Maybe this is a warning to all other conservative news nationwide.  Get pragmatic, report the news, not some fat-rats biased views & you can probably still make it in the newspaper world.

I still check both papers online, and am still often appalled at the lack of research into fairly basic articles. They repeatedly have to amend articles with basic information after being corrected having rushed to print whatever they were spoonfed by whomever...    My recent favorites are the article on the deserter stating that he is gonna serve 30 days, which they have since retracted. And having no shame the blame it on the fact they copied the article from another news source; and the story on the dead POS street thug which starts with the sentence ""Brandon Winn died because of an X-box""...err no, he actually died 'cos he pointed a gun at a cop...no wonder people won't pay for this worthless excuse for a newspaper.

And this is why Obama's invitation to Warren might just work. A major limitation to progressive thinking is our over-reliance on rational debate.

Thursday, January 8, 2009         Starbucks Cowers to the IWW         Media Statement delivered January 7 : Faced with the prospect of losing another trial in front of the National Labor Relations Board the Regional Director has agreed to let Starbucks settle the charges against them and forego the trial that was to begin today. The union is upset that the Board is agreeing to accept another Starbucks settlement in Grand Rapids instead of holding them accountable in open court. If this most recent settlement is approved it will be 3rd one allowed by the board in Grand Rapids. With the signing of each settlement Starbucks has said they would end their anti-union intimidation and each time it has continued unabated. We can be sure it will continue which is why union membership is so vital. Had the trial gone on here today in Grand Rapids we would have detailed the same type of union busting activity that Starbucks was found guilty of a couple weeks ago in New York. Internal communications would have been admitted into evidence showing upper management discussions about union organizing in Grand Rapids and speculation about barista's union sympathies. The same type of surveillance and monitoring that was going on in New York. Also, Starbucks selectively enforced the attendance policy, scheduled baristas based on their union sympathies, and gave me less in raises because of my union affiliation. Based on the evidence that would have been presented its unbelievable that Howard Schultz doesn't have knowledge of the huge anti-union operation in place at Starbucks. Its possible hes directing the whole operation. On July 5th of last year there was a Global Day of Action against Starbucks called by the Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union and the Seville (Spain) CNT. The Day of Action was called after Monica was fired from a Starbucks in Seville and I was fired here in Grand Rapids. Over 200 Starbucks were picketed in over 80 cities in 20 countries. We have a message from the CNT with an update of Monica's situation. ""In Sevilla (Spain), the CNT has forced Starbucks to recognise the unfairness of the dissmissal of our organizer Monica. The company compensated the worker with a severance of 45 days per year as the Spanish labor laws mandates. After the global day of action, groups of workers have gotten in touch with CNT in order to join the union and organize within Starbucks. From the Local Federation of Sevilla of CNT we send our greetings to Cole Dorsey and other members of the SWU. The CNT and the IWA will respond to all the international calls for solidarity against Starbucks or other multinational coporations. We will not allow the anti-union policy of such corporations."" There is still a MIOSHA determination that has to be resolved. MIOSHA also concluded that Starbucks wrongfully terminated me. A date will be set for a trial on those charges so we may still get our day in court. The important lesson of this process has been how important my union membership is. Had I not been a union member and Starbucks illegally fired me I would have just been fired. I happily pay my union dues every month because I know the power I have as a union member can't be produced on my own. The strength of solidarity that we have in the Starbucks Workers Union has produced positive results in every city that Starbucks has discriminated against IWW members. That is why virtually every day baristas join the Starbucks Workers Union. As Starbucks cuts labor hours for baristas nationally the only way we can combat the growing assault on our jobs is the collective direct action through the union. The economy is sinking because of corporate wrongdoing and the only way we will stop the trend and reverse the tide is through our solidarity on the job. We have another union victory and there will be many more in the future!

The settlement allows Starbucks to avoid an administrative trial that was scheduled to begin today.   Starbucks spokeswoman Tara Darrow said the company is working to finalize the settlement. She said Starbucks was approached by the NLRB Tuesday with a request to work out an agreement. In a complaint filed by the Detroit office of the NLRB in September, Cole Dorsey -- a Starbucks barista in Grand Rapids, Mich. -- said he received warnings and then was fired because of his ""sympathies for and activities on behalf of"" the Industrial Workers of the World, a union that has been attempting to gain a foothold at the gourmet coffee retailer. He was fired eight months after the IWW and Starbucks settled another complaint at the Grand Rapids store. As part of that settlement, Starbucks agreed to post notices on bulletin boards advising employees of their right to join a union. Starbucks said it fired Dorsey for being late. Starbucks shares fell 23 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $9.99.

AFTER A CRUSHING DEFEAT IN NEW YORK WATCH STARBUCKS ATTEMPT TO DODGE CHARGES IN GRAND RAPIDS! PACK THE COURTROOM FOR BARISTA RIGHTS! What :   A trial against Starbucks at the National Labor Relations Board over the wrongful termination of an IWW barista.  The proceedings are open to the public. Who :   Starbucks baristas, supporters from the IWW, the community, and Starbucks management officials. The IWW Starbucks Workers Union will be represented by attorney Rodger Webb of Webb, Englehardt, and Fernandes. Starbucks will be represented by David Khorey and Kelly Stoppels of Varnum, Riddering, Schmidt, and Howlett. The NLRB attorney on the case is Brad Howell. Why : Starbucks' is preparing to fight its second trial against Unfair Labor Practices.  Last week, in an  88 page decision , an administrative law judge found, among other things, that Starbucks maintained multiple policies which interfered with workers' right to communicate about the union and about working conditions; terminated three workers in retaliation for union activity; and repeatedly discriminated against union supporters. After an investigation triggered by charges from the IWW in Grand Rapids, the Labor Board hit Starbucks with a complaint alleging the illegal termination of an employee for union activity.The barista firing at issue in the case resulted in solidarity actions from around the world. Now Starbucks will have to answer for its illegal acts in open court, again! Despite the fierce anti-union campaign by the world's largest fast-food coffee outlet, baristas around the country continue to join the IWW Starbucks Workers Union to pressure the company on issues of concern including insecure work hours, poverty wages, and unaffordable health care.

In an  88-page decision , Judge Mindy E. Landow found, among other things, that Starbucks maintained multiple policies which interfered with workers' right to communicate about the union and about working conditions; terminated three workers in retaliation for union activity; and repeatedly discriminated against union supporters.  The decision comes despite a 2006 New York settlement in which Starbucks pledged to stop illegal anti-union activities and mirrors federal government action against the company for its conduct toward baristas in Minnesota and Michigan. ""The judge's decision coupled with previous government findings expose Starbucks for what it is --- a union-busting corporation that will go to staggering lengths to interfere with the right to freedom of association,"" said Daniel Gross, a barista and member of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union found to have been unlawfully terminated by the coffee giant.  ""In these trying economic times of mass layoffs and slashed work hours, it's more important than ever that Starbucks and every corporation is confronted with a social movement that insists on the right to an independent voice on the job."" The Board decision is the latest blow against a company that has experienced a stunning fall from grace.  From a precipitous decrease in customer demand to its increasingly tattered socially responsible image, the myriad of challenges facing Starbucks has resulted in the company losing over half its value from just a year ago.  The decision also represents a significant victory for the IWW Starbucks Workers Union which continues to grow across the country with baristas taking creative and determined actions to improve the security of works hours and win respect on the job.  Starbucks faces another Labor Board trial next month in Grand Rapids, Michigan over illegal union-busting. ""For the first time, a judge has confirmed the existence of a nationally coordinated anti-union operation at Starbucks,"" said Stuart Lichten, the attorney for the IWW Starbucks Workers Union in the case.  ""This decision conclusively establishes Starbucks' animosity toward labor organizing."" The union is confident that Judge Landow's copiously documented and well-reasoned 88-page decision will be upheld by the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C. should Starbucks appeal.  The victory is sure to be gratifying for the union's international supporters who conducted spirited global days of action in defense of Isis Saenz, Joe Agins, Jr., and Daniel Gross after their terminations which the Board has now found to be unlawful. The National Labor Relations Board attorneys on the case were Burt Pearlstone and Audrey Eveillard.  The union's attorney Stuart Lichten is a partner at Schwartz, Licthen & Bright, a prominent New York City labor law firm.  Starbucks was represented by union-avoidance lawyers Daniel Nash, Stacey Eisenstein, and Nicole Morgan at corporate firm Akin Gump. The IWW Starbucks Workers Union (StarbucksUnion.org) is an organization of almost 300 current and former Starbucks employees united for a living wage, secure work hours, and respect on the job.  Founded in 2004, the union uses direct action, litigation, and advocacy to both make systemic improvements at Starbucks and take on the company over unfair treatment of individual baristas. The Industrial Workers of the World (iww.org) is a rank and file labor union dedicated to democracy in the workplace and global solidarity.  January 7 10 am NLRB Region 7 at the Federal Building.

Union Barista Aaron Kocher said, ""This is the blog that Howard Schultz doesn't want you to read. As Starbucks' overpaid executives gut the company to feed greedy investors, we will bring the truth behind the brand into the public eye."" The blog, accessible at  http://tcsbuxunion.com , will provide an inside look at working conditions at Starbucks, keeping the public abreast of Starbucks' vicious attempts to thwart worker unionization amidst deteriorating working conditions.

The barista, a member of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union, was retaliated against after complaining about the effects of a perennially leaking roof.  The MIOSHA determination comes less than a month before embattled Starbucks faces a trial in Grand Rapids at the National Labor Relations Board over anti-union retaliation. ""Two federal agencies are holding Starbucks accountable in Grand Rapids for wantonly trampling employee rights. Without the IWW Starbucks Workers Union they may have gotten away with it,"" said Cole Dorsey, the fired barista and union member. The Michigan litigation comes on the heels of a recent settlement Starbucks signed with the NLRB in Minnesota.  In that instance they re-instated a barista who was wrongfully terminated for union activity and agreed to desist illegal anti-union activity.  The company and union are awaiting a judge’s decision in New York after a 2007 trial on over 30 counts of unlawful union-busting. The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is a grassroots organization of over 200 current and former employees at the world's largest coffee chain united for secure work hours and a living wage. The union has members throughout the United States fighting for systemic change at the company and remedying individual grievances with management. The SWU has been especially active in New York City, Chicago, the Twin Cities, and Grand Rapids. Union baristas, bussers, and shift supervisors have fought successfully toward improved scheduling and staffing levels, increased wages, and workplace safety. Workers who join the union have immediate access to co-workers and members of the community who will struggle with them for a better life on the job. ###           Posted by  Wobblybarista      at  5:57 AM                                                                   Monday, October 6, 2008         Starbucks faces another NLRB complaint (AP)        By LAUREN SHEPHERD  NEW YORK (AP) — Starbucks Corp. is facing another complaint from the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the gourmet coffee chain engaged in unfair labor practices by firing a barista in Michigan. The complaint, filed last month by the Detroit office of the NLRB, stems from an investigation into a charge made by employee Cole Dorsey earlier this year. According to the NLRB complaint, Dorsey — a member of the Industrial Workers of the World union at Starbucks — was fired June 6 from his job at a store in Grand Rapids, Mich. Before being fired, Dorsey had been given two prior disciplinary warnings by his store manager. The complaint alleges that Dorsey received the warnings and was fired because of his ""sympathies for and activities on behalf of"" the IWW Starbucks Workers Union. The union has been attempting to organize workers at the chain. ""We have reasonable cause to believe there may be a violation here when Starbucks terminated"" Dorsey, said Stephen Glasser, regional director at the Detroit NLRB office. The NLRB is requesting Starbucks re-hire Dorsey, compensate him for loss of wages, rescind the disciplinary warnings and post notices in the store saying workers have the right to unionize. Starbucks has until Oct. 14 to formally respond to the complaint. If the company does not settle the case, it will go to trial in front of an administrative law judge on Nov. 20. In a statement, Starbucks said Dorsey was fired after he was more than 30 minutes late to work. The disciplinary notices, the company said, were also related to tardiness. The company said the charge that his firing was due to union activity is ""without merit."" Starbucks also noted that the NLRB dismissed several charges made in Dorsey's case, including that the company encouraged co-workers to investigate Dorsey and did not allow employees to post union-related notices on the company bulletin board. The latest dustup with the NLRB follows the settlement of a case last week. In that case, the NLRB filed a complaint after a Starbucks employee in Minnesota, Erik Forman, said he was fired for promoting union activity. Starbucks, which fired Forman after he was 30 minutes late to work, later reversed its decision and re-hired him, saying his firing was ""ill-considered."" As part of the settlement, it also paid him for lost wages and posted a notice on his store's bulletin board affirming the rights of workers. That was the chain's third settlement of an NLRB complaint alleging that it was attempting to dissuade employees from joining a union. Starbucks has had a somewhat contentious relationship with the union, which says it represents about 200 current and former Starbucks workers. The union is now ""vowing action"" against the chain for a new scheduling system in which fewer employees will work more hours. The system is meant to foster an environment where baristas know their customers better in a bid to boost sales. The program is also meant to allow baristas to secure more hours each week. Starbucks does not guarantee full-time work hours, so employees have consistently complained that they have not been able to work as much as they would like. Under the new system, baristas can get ""full-time"" status if they work at least 32 hours a week. The union, however, says the new system still does not offer a guarantee that employees will get the 32 hours they need and it requires full-time baristas to be available to work 70 percent of the hours that stores are open. Starbucks shares fell 50 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $13.16 in afternoon trading.

With stark similarities to the Minnesota case and prior cases in New York, the National Labor Relations Board contends that Starbucks engaged in Unfair Labor Practices when it unlawfully terminated outspoken union member and barista, Cole Dorsey, because of his protected activities.  Starbucks also has a week to decide if they will settle the complaint issued against them that they further engaged in Unfair Labor Practices through their lawyer's interrogation of baristas.  Starbucks is set to stand trial on November 20, 2008. ""Starbucks tried to quietly get rid of me because as a union member I speak out for the respect baristas deserve,"" said Cole Dorsey, the fired barista and member of the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.  ""It's time for Starbucks to start addressing the issues, like poverty wages to baristas and coffee farmers, instead of spending tons of money on anti-union lawyers and social responsibility advertising gimmicks."" Concurrently, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the government's health safety watchdog, will soon announce their decision of a recently concluded trial to determine whether a barista was unlawfully terminated for reporting a health violation. In the OSHA trial, Starbucks management and local baristas testified regarding a barista who was fired a week after filing a health complaint over a leaky roof. Prior to the trial, lawyers from Varnum, Riddering, Schmidt, and Howlett interrogated multiple baristas in an attempt to find out what their answers would be at the OSHA trial. The prominent Grand Rapids corporate law firm continues to represent Starbucks after they signed a settlement agreement with the NLRB in 2006 saying they would end barista interrogations. “Starbucks’ aggressive anti-union attorneys may have crossed the line into illegality,” said Pete Montalbano, a New York-based organizer with the IWW Starbucks Workers Union.  “Given Starbucks’ track record of flaunting labor law, this doesn’t come as a surprise.” Starbucks’ legal woes are not unique to Michigan. The NLRB recently concluded an investigation of Starbucks in Minnesota after a union barista was wrongfully terminated at their Mall of America location. The barista was re-instated after union pressure and Starbucks has since settled those charges.  In 2006, Starbucks settled a large case against it in New York involving the right to communicate about the union and terminations of union supporters.  Finally, an administrative law judge in New York will soon announce a decision after a lengthy trial the NLRB prosecuted against Starbucks there involving over 30 counts of illegal anti-union activity. The IWW Starbucks Workers Union is a grassroots organization of over 200 current and former employees at the world's largest coffee chain united for secure work hours and a living wage. The union has members throughout the United States fighting for systemic change at the company and remedying individual grievances with management. The SWU has been especially active in New York City, Chicago, the Twin Cities, and Grand Rapids. Union baristas, bussers, and shift supervisors have fought successfully toward improved scheduling and staffing levels, increased wages, and workplace safety. Workers who join the union have immediate access to co-workers and members of the community who will struggle with them for a better life on the job. ###           Posted by  Wobblybarista      at  10:30 PM                                                                   Saturday, August 9, 2008         Starbucks baristas union drive comes at key time [City Pages]         The effort to organize local latte-slingers could hurt the ailing chain By Matt Snyders It was a typical, busy Thursday afternoon at the Mall of America's first-floor Starbucks, and Erik Forman was four hours into his shift. The slight, 23-year-old barista was soon approached by a vaguely familiar face: Caroline Kaker, the chain's Bloomington-based district manager. She pulled him aside and led him to the adjacent Barnes & Noble. There, she broke the grim news: You're fired. Forman was stunned. Sure, two weeks earlier, he had shown up a half-hour late and was issued a written warning. But that wasn't why Forman was getting the ax today. Management decided to deep-six him after learning that Forman had discussed the warning with co-workers. ""Erik violated terms of his June 2008 final written corrective action by discussing it with a peer,"" reads the notice of separation. But there was another topic Forman had discussed with peers, one not explicitly mentioned in the write-up: unionizing. A member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), Forman had been in the process of organizing his co-workers under the IWW banner for nearly two years. ""It started with workers during their situations during cigarette breaks, during car rides to and from work,"" Forman recalls. ""We first approached the IWW in September of '06. They helped us figure out how to build a strategy."" In 2004, the IWW took on a Starbucks in Midtown Manhattan, with modest success. In the following years, the list of IWW Starbucks Union affiliates grew to include five other shops in New York City; two in Chicago; one in Grand Rapids, Michigan; and one in Rockville, Maryland. Shortly after the first union sprouted in New York, Starbucks higher-ups exchanged concerned emails, leaked to The Wall Street Journal, about how to handle the epidemic of unionizing. One, dated October 29, 2004, begins with a blunt introduction: ""Below is a summary of the recent developments in New York City regarding our attempts to thwart a potential union situation,"" it reads. In March 2006, the IWW accused the coffee giant of union-busting and filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board. Starbucks settled, agreeing to display workers' rights posters in three of its stores and to allow two fired workers back on staff. ""The reasons they gave for firing me were identical to what they did in New York,"" says Forman, who's also filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. ""This is a pretty blatant example of union-busting. We've been planning on making our movement public for a while—so even though it comes as a blow, it's kind of a galvanizing blow."" On July 11, one day after Forman got clipped, five workers walked off the floor and approached the floor manager, Jason Lyons, with a petition demanding Forman's reinstatement. Lyons told them it was out of his hands. Now Forman and the IWW stand poised to organize baristas throughout the metro. On Monday, July 21, they went public. Their demands include a living wage, ""respectful"" scheduling, and an end to the company's alleged union-busting. Asked about Forman's allegations, a Starbucks spokesperson had little to say. ""We just received the charge [from Forman] and we're reviewing it,"" says Stacey Krum, on the phone from Seattle. ""There's nothing we can offer right now."" The charges clash with Starbucks' image as a corporate paragon of social responsibility. The Seattle-based chain has staked its reputation on progressive values that play well with its well-to-do clientele. Starbucks was listed as No. 7 in Fortune's ""100 Best Companies to Work For"" this year. The most frequently extolled of Starbucks' labor practices is its healthcare program. It's one of the few major retailers to provide health insurance to part-time employees. But that comes with a couple of caveats. First, in order to qualify, workers must log 240 hours per quarter. However, there are no guaranteed hours and many baristas complain of sporadic, unpredictable scheduling. As a result, only 65 percent of Starbucks workers, including management, meet the 240-hour minimum. Many of the remaining workers (particularly part-timers) decide not to buy into the plan; rent payments take priority over premiums. Consequently, the company's health insurance plan covers less than half (40.9 percent) of employees. As organizers like to point out, that's less than the oft-demonized Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which covers 47 percent of its workers. ""It's just incredible hypocrisy on this core identity issue,"" says IWW organizer Daniel Gross. ""It's absolutely misleading. It's taken a sub-par program and turned it into a marketing advantage through spin and PR."" Last week, Starbucks released the full list of 600-odd stores expected to close in the coming months, including 27 in Minnesota. Sixteen of the doomed shops sit in the Twin Cities metro.The closings will affect some 12,000 workers nationwide. On Monday, Forman's former co-workers at the Mall of America's Starbucks walked off the floor and issued a letter to management demanding ""just treatment of all employees affected by Starbucks' closure of stores nationwide."" With an economy seemingly in free-fall and job security plummeting, unionization—for good or ill—enjoys more appeal than it did 10 years ago. ""This will be the biggest fire they've had to put out in a while,"" says Forman. ""The economy is getting worse, people can't get by and are having to work 14-hour days. Management's biggest tool has always been the threat of firing. People are starting to think maybe that's a risk worth taking.""

Warren, who's at the center of a growing controversy over his inaugural invitation from the president-elect, said Prop. 8 became more about free speech than anything else. Speaking of free speech, as reported here, the  L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center  strongly criticized Obama  on Thursday for his invitation to Warren to pray with the immense crowd at the opening of the inaugural ceremony. The group also demanded that the Democratic president-elect disinvite Warren from participating.    Obama has said  he doesn't agree with some things Warren says  and vice versa, but Warren invited him to speak in August at the Saddleback Forum. And, Obama adds, disagreeing with someone doesn't mean being disagreeable to each other. That's something his campaign has preached about for two years. Listen to Obama explain it himself on the video.     Warren, who heads the mega-church Saddleback in Lake Forest, says he's got no problem with gays having relationships; just don't call it marriage, he says. Marriage is between one man and one woman and has been for 5,000 years in numerous religions.    Warren also points out that his congregation has donated many millions of dollars to help gays with AIDS, which couldn't possibly be labeled homophobic.

Our goal -- one of us on the East Coast and the other on the far more important or at least less humid West Coast -- was to write about Campaign '08 virtually around the clock.    Our second-ever posting, 12 months ago today,  previewed an upcoming  L.A. Times/Bloomberg Poll; later in the day, we  detailed the results  of the nationwide survey. The findings were in line with other polls of the time.    In the Republican presidential race, which then seemed the most likely to last deep into the primary season,  Rudy Giuliani  was perched in first place. His lead wasn't overwhelming, but it was strong enough that he appeared certain to remain a major contender.     His liberal record on social issues loomed as an obvious liability within his party, but his tough-on-terrorism message was attracting substantial support from moderates and GOP-leaning independents.         His major headache among rivals last June was an as-yet-undeclared candidate who was riding a wave as the great conservative hope --  Fred Thompson . He ran a strong second in the poll.    Lagging far behind were  John McCain  and  Mitt Romney , each barely with double-digit support. In our preview posting, we were especially scornful of McCain, noting sarcastically (and foolishly, as it turned out) that in the poll, he found himself ""in heated competition with the 'Don't Know' category.""    Meriting no mention from us was  Mike Huckabee , one of several back-of-the-pack candidates barely earning any support across the country.    The Democratic race, at that point, seemed so much more cut-and-dried.    Hillary Clinton  was the clear front-runner;  Barack Obama  was just as clearly ...

Not surprisingly,   the first topic spotlighted was the  Rev. Jeremiah Wright .    Here's the excerpt, which  leaves it unclear whether she was addressing a specific Wright remark or the inflammatory tenor of many of his comments  came after O'Reilly asked her: ""You're an American citizen. I'm an American citizen. He's an American citizen, Rev. Wright. What do you think when you hear a fellow American citizen say that stuff about America? What do you think?""  Well, I take offense at it. I think its offensive and outrageous. And, you know, Im going to express my opinion, others can express theirs. But, you know, it is -- it is part of, you know, just an atmosphere that were in today where all kinds of things are being said. ""And people have to, you know, decide what they believe. And I sure dont believe the United States government was behind AIDS. It makes perfect sense for Clinton to condemn Wright, especially on the AIDS issue. We wonder, though, if at some point in the interview she cut  Barack Obama  the type of slack  John McCain  did on Tuesday.    Here's part of the quote McCain gave CNN on Tuesday: ""I have made it very clear that I don't believe that Rev. Wright reflects the views of Sen. Obama, and I don't have anything more to say about it.""    ( Update:  Clinton told O'Reilly that Obama ""made his views clear, finally, and did what he had to do."")

Jeremiah Wright , is now official.    In comments in North Carolina today, Obama noted that he had given Wright the ""benefit of the doubt"" when the furor over the preacher first erupted in mid-March, based on YouTube snippets from past sermons in which his incendiary comments included a condemnation of America.    No more, the Democratic presidential contender stressed, following  Wright's remarks Monday  at the National Press Club in Washington.    Obama began his response today by saying that a belief in racial reconciliation ""is in my DNA"" (and given his biracial bloodlines, of course, that resonates as more more than just a symbolic phrase).    ""Yesterday, we saw a very different vision,"" Obama said of Wright's Washington appearance, which at one point he termed a ""performance.""    He could hardly have distanced himself farther from the man who officiated at his  wedding ceremony  and baptized his two children.    Obama described himself as ""outraged"" by many of Wright's remarks and ""saddened"" by what he termed ""the spectacle of what we saw yesterday.""    He characterized as ""ridiculous"" Wright's notion that the AIDS epidemic may have been a conspiracy inflicted on blacks by the federal government and that Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan should be considered a leading voice in modern times.

McCain actually  enjoys  mixing it up with those who disagree with him. Today, though, he was confronted with a determined group of young protestors who simply wanted to shout at him to make their point.    More than 1,000 people -- potentially a good sign for McCain's hopes in Tuesday's primary -- showed up midday to hear and question him at a school gymnasium in Salem, N.H. But, The Times' Maeve Reston reports, moments into his opening remarks the protesters interrupted, waving signs that called for $50 billion in spending to combat AIDS.    After the crowd greeted their chants with boos, the demonstrators piped down - prompting McCain to invite them to stay around and discuss the issue with him during the question-and-answer portion of his appearance.    I dont think Ive ever had a town hall meeting where I didnt try to listen to everybody, thats why, frankly, my friends, we're winning this campaign,"" he said (polls do show him  on the rise ).    The Q&A was not to be, however. A few minutes into the Arizona senators remarks, they resumed their chants -- People with AIDS are dying; youre not even trying.     As they shouted, McCain staff members began escorting them from the room. And some McCain supporters returned rhetorical fire by shouting: Mac is Back.    McCain also delivered a parting shot: You know, Ive always been curious why people like you who live in a free and open society would disrespect one of the most fundamental parts of America, and that is the ability to take part in the conversation with people who aspire to [political] office. Ill never understand it.    The crowd applauded.    -- Don Frederick                         Jan 6, 2008 12:06:59 PM  |   Permalink     |     Comments (11)     |  TrackBack (0)                               Thompson targets the leading teachers group               Restrained and constrained.

The pressure will be on Obama, whose bid to become the nation's first African-American president obviously will have resonance with the audience in Detroit. But while Obama has periodically excelled on the campaign trail when he's on his own, he has yet to clearly steal the spotlight at mass gatherings of White House contenders.    The Clinton name, of course, remains hugely popular within the black community. And Hillary can be counted on to be well-prepared when her turn comes Thursday, if her performance at the recent forum at Washington's Howard University was any indication. There, her comment that if AIDS ""was the leading cause of death of white women between the age of 25 and 34, there would be an outraged outcry in this country"" sparked the night's loudest clapping from a crowd well aware of the high death rates from the disease among younger blacks. It will be interesting to see if she's got a similarly pithy line to deliver.    Also interesting to watch will be how the lone Republican presidential candidate who accepted an invite to speak at the convention,  Tom Tancredo , is received. His strongly conservative voting record as a House member from Colorado is not one most NAACP members would support. But Tancredo can be expected to dwell on his signature issue --- cracking down on illegal immigration --- and that is a message with many adherents in the black community ( see this column by Earl Ofari Hutchinson).

Since the book's release in 2002, Rick Warren has gained a following as an evangelical who's willing to work with people of opposing viewpoints, but today he finds himself the target of criticism and controversy -- because of his position on gay marriage and the very public role he'll play at the dawn of President-elect Barack Obama's new administration.  For Warren, who takes pride in his reputation as a conciliator, it's an unexpected place to be. NBC's Ann Curry sat down with him two weeks ago for a wide-ranging interview on the same sex marriage controversy, his views on the economic crisis, and his relationship with political leaders, including President-elect Obama. Ann Curry:  So Barack Obama wins, you were disappointed or elated? Story continues below  advertisement |  your ad here Rick Warren:  I'm happy for Barack Obama to be the winner. I would have been happy for John McCain to be the winner. They're both friends. The Bible says pray for your president. Ann Curry:  Where is he, do you think, going to need a lot of prayer? Rick Warren:  The thing I'm praying for him and for all of our leaders are the three things I pray for myself for integrity, for humility, and for generosity. Humility is being honest about your weaknesses. And humility is being willing to listen. And I think even in this transition period, we've seen how President-elect Obama has been willing to listen even to people who he disagrees with. That's a great sign of a great leader. Video   Rick Warren on his Reader's Digest initiative  Rick Warren announces a new partnership with Reader's Digest. Dateline NBC Ann Curry:  It sounds as though you have tremendous hope for Barack Obama and his future as a president. But, you know, he is pro-choice. Rick Warren:  Yeah. Ann Curry:  You are not. How can you admire and say you are a friend of a man who's been elected president who believes in basically what you believe to be murder? Rick Warren:  Because no president, no leader... I can't get my wife to agree with my on everything or my kids to agree with everything. To me the issue of life is extremely important to me. But what Ive learned over the last probably 30 years is the president doesn't have as much power over that as everybody thinks he does because we've had pro-life presidents for years and years and years and nothing's changed. But he still sees a role for himself offering guidance to those in public life. Ann Curry:  You know, Billy Graham had that same attitude. He did it differently. But he counseled many presidents, one after another on both sides of the aisle. Rick Warren:  They're still people. And they get hurt by criticism and everybody does that. After Purpose Driven Life came out, they began to call me 'cause-- ""I think that guy's safe."" I don't ever talk about what I say to them. It's all confidential. And it's all really more encouragement on a personal level.  Recently he's been offering encouragement on an issue that's on American's minds this Christmas season the economic crisis. Rick Warren:  365 times in the Bible is a phrase used: ""Fear not.""  Ann Curry:  How can people not be afraid, reverend? Rick Warren:  It takes me back to the first Christmas. Mary and Joseph had these exact same problems. They didn't have housing. There was no room at the inn. They had travel problems. It was financially a tough time. They weren't wealthy. They were poor. It's a lesson Warren's been teaching on the true meaning of the holiday, and he's turned it into a new book, ""The Purpose of Christmas.""  Rick Warren:  God is saying, ""I want you to get the message. You need to trust me. He's saying, 'I want you to relax.'"" You never know God is all you need until God's all you got.  More from the interview In these troubled times, Warren says, for Christians and non-Christians alike, there's only one source of true security. Rick Warren:  Money can be taken from you. As this last three months have shown, you can lose it a lot of different ways. Relationships can be taken from you. People can die. If you're going have security, you've gotta put it in something that cannot ever be taken from you. And that's a relationship to God. Ann Curry:  So for the person who's sitting right now who's rolling his eyes or her eyes because he just lost his home, who doesn't know how he's gonna pay for his next meal, you say what? Rick Warren:  Well, first I say don't blame God because people will typically say, ""Well, it must be God's will."" Well, there's a word for that: baloney.  Yet Warren says the economy's sorry state  does  have a Biblical explanation:  Rick Warren:  We walked away from God's principles.  Ann Curry:  Which principle did we walk away from to cause this economic collapse? Click for related content Saddleback Church: More on 'The Purpose of Christmas'   TODAY: Rick Warren talks about his book Rick Warren:  The Judeo-Christian principles that America was built on were principles like thrift, like delayed gratification. Like you don't buy it until you can afford it. But we buy things we don't need with money we don't have to impress people we don't even like. ( laughter ) And then when the chickens come to roost, we start to blame God for the economic problems. I think at this time we have to go back and say what matters most --- realize there's a purpose begind every problem and that sometimes what we think is a problem is actually a protection in our lives.  Case in point, he says, in October, the Warrens' 25-year-old daughter-in-law, Jaime, was seven and a half months pregnant with her first child when she went into labor. Rick Warren:  So we thought that's a problem, a premature baby. Then the baby turned out to be breached.

See more from one of the most influential pastors of our time this Friday on Dateline NBC from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. ET. Dateline NBC An emergency C-section saved the baby's life, but soon, Jaime was diagnosed with a large benign brain tumor. In November, she went through three delicate brain operations to remove it. And her father-in-law was left asking questions. Rick Warren:  [They're the] questions everybody asks: ""Why me? Why now? Why this?"" And those questions are unanswerable. You're never gonna get the answer on this side of eternity. But Warren says he found that even these frightening episodes had a purpose... because the C-section delivery spared Jaime's life. Rick Warren:  If she had pushed, it would have killed her. So what we thought really was a negative-- God actually was using it to save her life.

Politics and pocket books dominated both News and Search, but wild weather, military setbacks, and medical miracles also set the world abuzz.                               1 Hurricanes 2 Caylee and Casey Anthony 3 Election 2008 4 Pakistan 5 Pregnant Man 6 China 7 Iraq 8 Shelley Malil 9 Patrick Swayze 10 Afghanistan                                             Paths of Destruction   From hurricanes to earthquakes,  floods  to  wildfires , natural disasters assailed virtually every corner of our planet. The  Chengdu earthquake  devastated the region of Sichuan, less than three months before China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics. Months later, a  temblor in  Pakistan  left thousands homeless.     In the Americas, hurricanes shook Search:  Gustav 's torrential rains blistered through Jamaica and Cuba. A month later, New Orleans braced itself for what many thought could be  Katrina 's second coming, and the 2005 Atlantic hurricane resurfaced in searches.  Ike  spared the Big Easy, but users flocked to the Web to follow its devastating trail through Galveston Island, Texas.      Citizen Uprisings    Weather even played a role in politics this year, when the Republican National Convention delayed its start and adopted a more somber tone. Elections around the world stage highlighted power struggles, including those in  Russia ,  Pakistan ,  Thailand , and  Zimbabwe .  All eyes, however, turned to the long slog for the  U.S. presidency  with all its historical twists and turns. Within the U.S., searchers turned out in droves at every stage, investigating politicians,  delegates ,  voter registration , and the  Electoral College .    Shifting Winds of War   The last leg of the presidential race became dominated by the economy, but issues of national security never left Searchers' minds. On March 20, Americans and Iraqis quietly marked the  fifth anniversary  of the war as violence de-escalated through much of Iraq.  Violence in  Afghanistan , however, continued to grow, ultimately making 2008 the deadliest year  for U.S. troops in that country. Searches again spiked for Afghanistan when a  magazine leaked news  that Britain's Prince Harry was serving on the war's front lines. After a well-publicized (and royal) routing, New Idea  apologized , and Harry was sent home to avoid drawing attentionand possibly dangerto his regiment.    The specter of global conflict accelerated during, of all times, the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Games opened with great fanfare on China's luckiest day of the century: 08.08.08. But as the world united in Beijing, a deadly situation escalated in the former Soviet Union. Searches for Russia ballooned as the U.S., NATO, and other Western countries condemned the violence and demanded  Russia  remove its forces from  Georgia .      Gone, but not Forgotten   Among the crime stories that mesmerized people, the missinglike that of  Natalee Holloway  or  Madeleine McCann remained high in searchers' minds. But  Caylee Anthony , a Florida toddler who disappeared under very suspicious circumstances, captivated interest especially since the story was first reported in late summer. Her mother  Casey  was arrested on first-degree murder charges less than three months after Cindy Anthony, Casey's own mother, called 911 to report the case. 2008 finally brought some relief to the loved ones of  JonBenet Ramsey 12 years after her death, local police ruled out her family members as suspects.   Surprise Endings   No one rose from obscurity to celebrity faster than the  pregnant man . Born a woman, Thomas Beatie captivated both the world and  the Web  with one very famous photo and one very popular appearance on Oprah. Search predictably spiked a few months later when the bearded transgender man gave birth to a beautiful baby girl named Susan Juliette ... soon to be followed by a  sibling .    Patrick Swayze  may be no stranger to movie fame, but a surprising battle with pancreatic cancer thrust him into this year's spotlight. Search soared as people researched the 56-year-old actor's grim diagnosis. Just a few months later, after enduring rigorous chemotherapy, the beloved dirty dancer shocked everyone by heading back to work on a new  TV show .                                                              Pinnacles and Pitfalls                 O lympian highs and politics as unusual, to celebrity hopefuls and market meltdowns: Through millions of searches and thousands of stories each day, people sought to make sense of the world around them. Take a look back at what captivated our imagination and fueled our passions in 2008, a very historic year indeed.

clueweb09-en0011-30-23975	"                               Starbucks Brews Challenge for Labor       September 29th, 2008 | Kim Fellner          Whassup with  Starbucks  and labor?  My research for  Wrestling With Starbucks: Conscience, Capital, Cappuccino  plunged me below the foam and the fury to discover a company rife with contradictions, and nowhere more clearly than in its dealings with workers.    In contrast to Wal-Mart, Starbucks is considered a leader in socially responsible business practices.  It was an early adopter of health care for domestic partners, pioneered benefits for part-timers, has a vividly multiracial workforce (including top officials), emphasizes training, and often promotes from within, although the opportunities are diminishing along with the companys stock price.  In other words, when it comes to how it treats its workers, Starbucks is far better than the miserable norm.   What Wal-Mart and Starbucks share, though is a baseline hourly wage that generally hovers between seven and ten dollars.  They also share an antipathy to unions.  “Were not anti-union, were pro-partner,” is the official Starbucks mantra; but while there is some validity to the latter assertion, the first part stretches credibility.  Over the years, Starbucks has vigorously fought union organizing drives, sometimes to the point of illegality.  As Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz wrote in his book,  Pour Your Heart Into It  (Hyperion, 1997), he wanted Starbucks workers “to believe in their hearts that management trusted them and treated them with respect.  I was convinced that under my leadership, employees would come to realize that I would listen to their concerns. If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldnt need a union.”   Indeed, it often seems that todays unions are ill suited to meet the needs of younger workers or the challenges of organizing in the global economy.  But as Andy Stern, president of the  Service Employees International Union  rightly observes, “You look at a guy like Howard Schultz and you say, ‘Okay, youre a really good employer, but youre a corporation.’  When does somebody come into Starbucks and say, ‘these 50,000 dollars for manager salaries are too high; and these health care costs are really getting out of control….’ What is it that institutionalizes the good practices so its not noblesse oblige?”   What complicates the problem is that workplace democracyone of the most important values that unions addis not a money-making proposition.  Yet, alongside blunting economic disparity, it is perhaps the foremost reason for unions to exist.  For authentic worker issues to be incorporated into the debates over the global economy, not to mention the outcome, workers must have a collective presence of their own, one that transcends the individual workplace and has the potential to encompass the global marketplace. No matter how benevolent Starbucks might be, its not going to explicitly argue on behalf of worker concerns. Some of whats good for General Motors or Starbucks might also benefit employees. But some of what makes life sustainable for workers, be it living wages, or health and safety regulations, can easily be sacrificed to corporate bottom lines unless there is a countervailing demand.   Already, with the plummeting economy, efforts to make Starbucks leaner and meaner are affecting the workforce, as “partners” are feeling more like disposable workers.  When I first started my research, an astonishing number of employees gave the company kudos despite its flaws.  Today, not so much.  Recently, I took copies of my Starbucks book to some of the baristas and store managers I had interviewed.  “I dont know,” one of them told me.  “When I started six years ago, this was the best job of its kind. Now its all about the money.  Its like nobody cares about us any more.”   Thats a real problem for Starbucks, and for all of us. As long as we mandate the sustainability of capital and leave worker rights to paternalism, our conscience will be at risk.      About the Author:    Kim Fellner is the author of Wrestling With Starbucks: Conscience, Capital, Cappuccino (Rutgers University Press, July). She works in the labor movement.

One Response to “Starbucks Brews Challenge for Labor”                     Erik  Says:              November 19th, 2008 at 3:57 am         I was fired for discussing unionization at Starbucks. I’m glad to see that labor liberals are beginning to acknowledge that workers at Starbucks have not only a right, but a need, to organize for their own independent voice on the job. Although it is useful to isolate, even villify, an enemy (such as Wal-Mart) and polarize society against them, this kind of tactic eventually weakens the labor movement by making some workers think that they don’t ‘need’ a union. Corporations couldn’t be happier with the result.   Also, what is this Andy Stern quote supposed to mean? He has come out AGAINST workers at Starbucks organizing in the past, claiming that Starbucks is a ‘good’ corporation. So now that the capitalist economy is taking a tumble, is SEIU or UNITE-HERE, or for that matter, Working America going to come to the rescue of me and my low-wage fellow retail workers? I doubt it. So we organize our own union with the IWW and get put down by the likes Stern and Fellner, people who make 5-20 times as much as we do to write books and make grand statements about the future of the labor movement.

Why did he do it?                                                                                                On the left, reaction to the news that Rick Warren would be giving the invocation at Barack Obamas inauguration was swift and furious. The president of The Human Rights Campaign, the countrys largest gay and lesbian human rights organization, published an open letter to the president-elect, which began, Let me get right to the point. Your invitation to Reverend Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at your inauguration is a genuine blow to LGBT Americans. Many writers described the choice as a slap in the face (a phrase I myself used in a  column  in the  Guardian UK ), or said they felt theyd been spit on. A headline on The Huffington Post described it as Obamas first real rift with progressives. Its possible that all this anger has taken the Obama team by surprise; perhaps they dont quite understand it. After all, Warrens participation is a symbolic concession to conservative evangelicals that costs nothing in policy terms; as a gesture of goodwill and bridge-building, its surely superior to, say, a court appointment. In the past, one of Obamas great strengths has been the way hes made those who disagree with him feel acknowledged and respected. Besides, Obama clearly wants to convey that, unlike George W. Bush, he doesnt just want to be the president of those who voted for him. As the  Atlantic s Marc Ambinder wrote on his blog, [I]gnoring something [sic] like Warren, a mainstream figure who commands the respect of million[s] of Americans, would be foolish. Obamas message is: Rick Warren is a part of Obamas America, too. At a time of serious life-or-death crises throughout the country, maybe all the sturm and drang over symbolism seems a bit silly to Obama insiders. Yet this is symbolism with real-world consequences and concrete implications. First of all, it reifies the image that Warren has been assiduously constructing for himself as Americas Pastor, a post-partisan and benevolent figure with a quasi-official role atop the nations civic life. When it comes to his public persona, Warren is something of a magician. He has convinced much of the media and many influential Democrats that he represents a new, more centrist breed of evangelical with a broader agenda than the old religious right. This is, in many ways, deceptive. Yes, Warren has done a lot of work on AIDS in Africa, but he supports the same types of destructive, abstinence-only policies as the Bush administration. One of his protegs, Ugandan pastor  Martin Ssempa , has been a major force in moving that country away from its lifesaving safer-sex programs. Hes been known to burn condoms at Makerere University, the prestigious school in Ugandas capital, and in his Pentecostal services, marked by much sobbing and speaking in tongues, he offers the promise of faith healing to his desperate congregants, a particularly cruel ruse in a country ravaged by HIV. The truth is that the primary difference between Warren and, say, James Dobson is the formers penchant for Hawaiian shirts. Warren compares abortion to the  Holocaust , gay marriage to  pedophilia and incest , and social gospel Christians as  closet Marxists . He doesnt believe in evolution. He has won plaudits from some journalists for his honesty in forthrightly admitting that he believes that Jews are going to hell, but even if one sees such candor is a virtue, the underlying conviction hardly qualifies him as an ecumenical peacemaker. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, Warren himself  described  his differences with Dobson as mainly a matter of tone, and was unable to come up with a theological issue on which they disagree. If Democrats collaborate in positioning Warren as the centrist alternative to the religious right, they consign vast numbers of people, including many of the partys most dedicated supporters, to the fringe. It does strengthen Warren as kind of a new Billy Graham figure, says the Reverend Dan Schultz, a United Church of Christ pastor and the founder of the progressive religious blog  Street Prophets . That has especial relevance for Warrens role in Africa, where a very conservative kind of evangelical Christianity is exploding, bringing with it virulently anti-gay politics. What I have heard is that it will help Warren overseas, Schultz says of Warrens role in the inauguration. Hes big into work in Africa. This will give him a lot of clout over there. Part of the reason this is kind of insulting for me is that Warren has supported some pretty awful people in Africa, including people who think homosexuals should be jailed. Feminists and gay people have long feared that the Democrats much-vaunted new religious outreach would come at their expense, and the Warren choice seriously exacerbates such anxieties. Both groups have long complained that that their concerns arent taken seriously by the broader progressive coalition, a lament thats gained urgency in the wake of the explosive sexual politics that marked the election. By honoring Warren, Obama is rubbing salt into wounds that have barely begun to heal. This is not a gay issue, this is not about abortion, its about every aspect of sexual equality and dignity, says the feminist writer and philosopher Linda Hirshman. This is about every woman who supported the president-elect, not just the gay ones and not just the ones needing abortions. After all, Warren is not just anti-abortionhe is anti-egalitarian. A page on his Web site Pastors.com, a resource for his fellow Christian leaders, features a woman named Beth Moore explaining and even celebrating the necessity of wifely submission. God granted women a measure of freedom in submission that we can learn to enjoy, she explains. It is a relief to know that as a wife and mother I am not totally responsible for my family. I have a husband to look to for counsel and direction. I can rely on his toughness when I am too soft and his logic when I am too emotional. The point is not that Obama believes this stuff, or even that he should only surround himself with liberal spiritual advisers. But his inauguration is supposed to be a celebration of concord, of transcendence of the divisive culture war politics of the last eight years. By choosing Warren, he is suggesting that Warrens positions on gay people, women and Jews arent really that bad, and that he can be a unifying force in American life. Whether Obama intends to or not, hes  pulling a Sister Souljah  on some of his most ardent backers, writing them out of the American mainstream at precisely the time when, thanks to his election, they were so dearly hoping to reenter it. Now, many are trying to get Obama to drop Warren. The comments on Change.gov, the Obama transition Web site, are full of heartbreak and disenchantment. At midday on Thursday, the very first of them read:  Saddened, betrayed, disappointedI have to echo the comments of so many here. I feel a real loss this morning as I take in this news about Warren. Mr. Obama, I had such hope. On the night of your election, I waited anxiously and ultimately celebrated with a group of family and friends of all backgrounds and orientations. We felt that finally, people like us, people of intellect, creativity, and thoughtfulness, had a real voice again. If this is an example of what we can expect from your administration, then you made a fool of me. Jettisoning Warren might assuage such feelings, but it would carry real political dangers, reinforcing the narrative that Democrats are hostile to religion. Warren would appear as a martyr to the unreasonable, godless left. It keys into that narrative that progressives dont know what theyre doing when it comes to religion, and they dont really like it, says Schultz. Besides, he adds, Americans tend to think of these things as very personal decisions, and they dont like people coming between themselves and their pastors. Thats why the whole controversy with Jeremiah Wright didnt take off. People thought, whatever we think about Jeremiah Wright, he is Obamas pastor and that it is his right. At this point, then, the best hope may be that the fusillades of outrage get through. Obama is sending a message of respect and conciliation to those who oppose gay rights, womens rights and secularism more broadly. Ordinarily such a master of empathy, he needs to find a way to make social progressives feel understood and included as well. Insulting your supporters to win the support of your opponents is no way to build unity.

Posted by jnickj6 on December 19, 2008 at  3:11 PM          If we can get over ""the sticker shock"" and look at what President Elect Obama is trying to do, we may see that it isn't all that bad...nor really.  I don't think that Mr. Obama was really ""saying anything"" by appointing Nut-Job Warren--well not much. I believe that since Obama had already won over the majority of LGBTQ persons, I think this is merely a ""token gesture to those who didn't vote for him in the first place."" He is reaching out to those who aren't quite comfortable with him, in an attempt to win them over. While it may not be the best choice, at least Mr. Obama has handed an olive-branch to the Right-Wing-Evangelicals; then again, at what expense? He alienated the very group who supported and helped elect him into office.  In in an attempt to appease one group, another group feels betrayed. Regardless of who was chosen, some group, somewhere would feel slighted. I don't like it anymore than any of you. I think it is a royal screwing, but it could be worse--We could be stuck ""with the wrinkly old white dude"" and ""the air-head.""    It is tricky to hand-feed a two-headed alligator and not get bitten...

I would prefer an atheist deliver the invocation e.g. Richard Dawkins and/or a follower of the Buddha like the Dali Lama.  Mr. Warren will certainly not be using the invocation as an opportunity to condemn abortions and bash gays I hope. As Obama said during his acceptance speech: ""America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past. "" Perhaps having Warren provide the invocation is just Obama walking the walk. Giving people with opposing views a platform to air their grievances is pretty consistent with a better way to solve our problems than just shutting them out. I will listen carefully to what Mr. Warren wants to invoke at such an auspicious time.

He is the first  African American  to hold the office. Obama was the  junior   United States Senator  from  Illinois  from 2005 until he resigned following his  election  to the  presidency . He was  inaugurated  as President on January 20, 2009.   Obama is a graduate of  Columbia University  and  Harvard Law School , where he was the  first African American  president of the  Harvard Law Review . He worked as a  community organizer  in  Chicago  prior to earning his law degree, and practiced as a  civil rights  attorney in Chicago before serving three terms in the  Illinois Senate  from 1997 to 2004. He also taught  Constitutional Law  at the  University of Chicago Law School  from 1992 to 2004. Following an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the  U.S. House of Representatives  in 2000, Obama was elected to the Senate in November 2004. Obama delivered the  keynote address  at the  Democratic National Convention  in July 2004.

Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language  class at the  University of Hawaii at Mnoa , where his father was a foreign student on scholarship. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  The couple married on February 2, 1961 [ 14 ] , and Obama was born later that year. Obama's parents separated when Obama was two years old, and they divorced in 1964. [ 13 ]  Obama's father returned to Kenya and saw his son only once more before dying in an automobile accident in 1982. [ 15 ]   After her divorce, Dunham married  Indonesian  student  Lolo Soetoro , who was attending college in Hawaii. When  Soeharto , a military leader in Soetoro's home country,  came to power  in 1967, all students studying abroad were recalled and the family moved to  Indonesia . [ 16 ]  There Obama attended local schools in  Jakarta , such as Besuki Public School and St. Francis of Assisi School, until he was ten years old.   He then returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn  and  Stanley Armour Dunham , while attending  Punahou School  from the  fifth grade  in 1971 until his graduation from high school in 1979. [ 17 ]  Obama's mother returned to Hawaii in 1972 for five years, and then in 1977 went back to Indonesia, where she worked as an  anthropological  field worker. She stayed there most of the rest of her life, returning to Hawaii in 1994. She died of  ovarian cancer  in 1995. [ 18 ]          Right-to-left: Barack Obama and half-sister  Maya Soetoro-Ng , with their mother  Ann Dunham  and grandfather  Stanley Dunham , in Hawaii (early 1970s).       Of his early childhood, Obama has recalled, ""That my father looked nothing like the people around me  that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk  barely registered in my mind."" [ 19 ]  In his 1995 memoir, he described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his  multiracial  heritage. [ 20 ]  He wrote that he used  alcohol ,  marijuana  and  cocaine  during his teenage years to ""push questions of who I was out of my mind."" [ 21 ]  At the  2008 Civil Forum on the Presidency , Obama identified his high-school drug use as his ""greatest moral failure."" [ 22 ]   Some of his fellow students at Punahou School later told the  Honolulu Star-Bulletin  that Obama was mature for his age, and that he sometimes attended college parties and other events in order to associate with African American students and military service people. Reflecting later on his formative years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: ""The opportunity that Hawaii offered  to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect  became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear."" [ 23 ]   Following high school, Obama moved to  Los Angeles  in 1979 to attend  Occidental College . [ 24 ]  After two years he transferred in 1981 to  Columbia University  in New York City, where he majored in  political science  with a specialization in  international relations . [ 25 ]  Obama graduated with a  B.A.  from Columbia in 1983. He worked for a year at the  Business International Corporation [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  and then at the  New York Public Interest Research Group . [ 28 ] [ 29 ]   After four years in New York City, Obama moved to Chicago, where he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based  community organization  originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland ( Roseland ,  West Pullman  and  Riverdale ) on Chicago's far  South Side . He worked there for three years from June 1985 to May 1988. [ 28 ] [ 30 ]  During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from one to thirteen and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000. His achievements included helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens . [ 31 ]  Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation , a community organizing institute. [ 32 ]  In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time to Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives  for the first time. [ 33 ]   Obama entered  Harvard Law School  in late 1988. He was selected as an editor of the  Harvard Law Review  at the end of his first year, [ 34 ]  and president of the journal in his second year. [ 35 ]  During his summers, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley & Austin  in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter  in 1990. [ 36 ]  After graduating with a  Juris Doctor (J.D.)   magna cum laude [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. [ 34 ]   Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review  gained national media attention [ 35 ]  and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations. [ 39 ]  In an effort to recruit him to their faculty, the  University of Chicago Law School  provided Obama with a fellowship and an office to work on his book. [ 39 ]  He originally planned to finish the book in one year, but it took much longer as the book evolved into a personal memoir. In order to work without interruptions, Obama and his wife,  Michelle , traveled to  Bali  where he wrote for several months. The manuscript was finally published in mid-1995 as  Dreams from My Father . [ 39 ]   From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote , a voter registration drive with a staff of ten and 700 volunteers; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, and led to  Crain's Chicago Business  naming Obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under Forty"" powers to be. [ 40 ] [ 41 ]   For twelve years, Obama served as a professor at the  University of Chicago Law School  teaching  Constitutional Law . He was first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996 and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004. [ 42 ]  He also joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a twelve-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate  for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel  from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002. [ 28 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ]   Obama was a founding member of the board of directors of  Public Allies  in 1992, resigning before his wife, Michelle, became the founding executive director of Public Allies Chicago in early 1993. [ 28 ] [ 45 ]  He served from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago , which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project, and also from 1994 to 2002 on the board of directors of the  Joyce Foundation . [ 28 ]  Obama served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge  from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999. [ 28 ]  He also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Center for Neighborhood Technology, and the Lugenia Burns Hope Center. [ 28 ]     Political career: 19962008     State legislator: 19972004       Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate  in 1996, succeeding State Senator  Alice Palmer  as Senator from Illinois's 13th District, which then spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park - Kenwood  south to  South Shore  and west to  Chicago Lawn . [ 46 ]  Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation reforming ethics and health care laws. [ 47 ]  He sponsored a law increasing  tax credits  for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. [ 48 ]  In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures. [ 49 ]   Obama was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was reelected again in 2002. [ 50 ]  In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary run for  the U.S. House of Representatives  to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush  by a margin of two to one. [ 51 ] [ 52 ]   In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. [ 53 ]  He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling  by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. [ 48 ] [ 54 ]  During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty  reforms. [ 55 ]  Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate. [ 56 ]     2004 U.S. Senate campaign     See also:  United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004     In mid-2002, Obama began considering a run for the U.S. Senate; he enlisted political strategist  David Axelrod  that fall and formally announced his candidacy in January 2003. [ 57 ]  Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald  and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun  not to contest the race launched wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. [ 58 ]  Obama's candidacy was boosted by Axelrod's advertising campaign featuring images of the late Chicago Mayor  Harold Washington  and an endorsement by the daughter of the late  Paul Simon , former U.S. Senator for Illinois. [ 59 ]  He received over 52% of the vote in the March 2004 primary, emerging 29% ahead of his nearest Democratic rival. [ 60 ]   In July 2004, Obama wrote and delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention  in Boston, Massachusetts. [ 61 ]  After describing his maternal grandfather's experiences as a  World War II  veteran and a beneficiary of the  New Deal's   FHA  and  G.I. Bill  programs, Obama spoke about changing the U.S. government's economic and social priorities. He questioned the Bush administration's management of the Iraq War and highlighted America's obligations to its soldiers. Drawing examples from U.S. history, he criticized heavily partisan views of the electorate and asked Americans to find unity in diversity, saying, ""There is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there's the United States of America."" [ 62 ]  Though it was not televised by the  three major broadcast news networks , a combined 9.1 million viewers watching on  PBS ,  CNN ,  MSNBC ,  Fox News  and  C-SPAN  saw Obama's speech, which was a highlight of the convention and confirmed his status as the Democratic Party's brightest new star. [ 63 ]   Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan , withdrew from the race in June 2004. [ 64 ]  Two months later and less than three months before Election Day,  Alan Keyes  accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination to replace Ryan. [ 65 ]  A long-time resident of Maryland, Keyes established legal residency in Illinois with the nomination. [ 66 ]  In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70% of the vote to Keyes' 27%, the largest victory margin for a statewide race in Illinois history. [ 67 ]     U.S. Senator: 20052008       Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama       Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 4, 2005. [ 68 ]  Obama was the fifth African-American Senator in U.S. history, and the third to have been  popularly elected . [ 69 ]  He was the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus . [ 70 ]   CQ Weekly ,  a nonpartisan publication, characterized him as a ""loyal Democrat"" based on analysis of all Senate votes in 20052007. The  National Journal  ranked him as the ""most liberal"" senator based on an assessment of selected votes during 2007; in 2005 he was ranked sixteenth most liberal, and in 2006 he was ranked tenth. [ 71 ] [ 72 ]  In 2008, Congress.org ranked him as the eleventh most powerful Senator. [ 73 ]  Obama announced on November 13, 2008 that he would resign his senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck  session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency. [ 74 ] [ 75 ]  This enabled him to avoid the conflict of dual roles as President-elect and Senator in the lame duck session of Congress, which no sitting member of Congress had faced since  Warren Harding . [ 76 ]     Legislation     See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate            Senate bill sponsors Tom Coburn (R-OK) and Obama discussing the CoburnObama Transparency Act. [ 77 ]       Obama voted in favor of the  Energy Policy Act of 2005  and cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act . [ 78 ]  In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the  Secure Fence Act . [ 79 ]  Obama introduced two initiatives bearing his name: LugarObama, which expanded the  NunnLugar cooperative threat reduction  concept to conventional weapons, [ 80 ]  and the  CoburnObama Transparency Act , which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. [ 81 ]  On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama, along with Senators  Thomas R. Carper ,  Tom Coburn , and  John McCain , introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. [ 82 ]   Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee. [ 83 ]  Obama is not hostile to  tort reform  and voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005  and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008  which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping  operations. [ 84 ]   In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo  Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor. [ 85 ]  In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act , which was signed into law in September 2007. [ 86 ]  Obama also introduced  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act , a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections [ 87 ]  and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007 , [ 88 ]  neither of which have been signed into law.          Obama and U.S. Sen.  Richard Lugar  (R-IN) visit a Russian mobile launch missile dismantling facility in August 2005. [ 89 ]       Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges. [ 90 ]  This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. [ 91 ]  He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. [ 92 ] [ 93 ]  Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program  providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries. [ 94 ]     Committees   Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations ,  Environment and Public Works  and  Veterans' Affairs  through December 2006. [ 95 ]  In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions  and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs . [ 96 ]  He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs . [ 97 ]  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas  before he became  President  of the  Palestinian Authority , and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi  condemning corruption in the Kenyan government. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ]       2008 Presidential campaign       Main articles:  Barack Obama presidential primary campaign, 2008  and  Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008             Wikinews  has related news:  Barack Obama elected 44th President of the United States       On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol  building in  Springfield, Illinois . [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ]  The choice of the announcement site was symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln  delivered his historic  ""House Divided""  speech in 1858. [ 104 ]  Throughout the campaign, Obama emphasized the issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War , increasing  energy independence  and providing  universal health care . [ 105 ]          Obama stands on stage with his wife and two daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois , Feb. 10, 2007.       During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. [ 106 ] [ 107 ] [ 108 ]  On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing  in the general election since the system was created in 1976. [ 109 ]   A large number of candidates initially entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries . After a few initial contests, the field narrowed to a contest between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton , with each winning some states and the race remaining close throughout the primary process. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] [ 113 ]  On May 31, the  Democratic National Committee  agreed to seat all of the disputed  Michigan  and  Florida  delegates at the national convention, each with a half-vote, narrowing Obama's delegate lead. [ 114 ]  On June 3, with all states counted, Obama passed the threshold to become the  presumptive nominee . [ 115 ] [ 116 ]  On that day, he gave a victory speech in St. Paul, Minnesota. Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed him on June 7. [ 117 ]  From that point on, he campaigned for the general election race against Senator  John McCain , the  Republican  nominee.   On August 23, 2008, Obama announced that he had selected  Delaware  Senator  Joe Biden  as his vice presidential running mate. [ 118 ]          Obama delivers  his presidential election victory speech  in  Grant Park .       At the  Democratic National Convention  in  Denver ,  Colorado , Obama's former rival Hillary Clinton gave a speech in support of Obama's candidacy and later called for Obama to be nominated by  acclamation  as the Democratic presidential candidate. [ 119 ] [ 120 ]  On August 28, Obama delivered a speech to 84,000 supporters in Denver. During the speech, which was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide, he accepted his party's nomination and presented his policy goals. [ 121 ] [ 122 ]   After McCain was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, there were three  presidential debates  between Obama and McCain in September and October 2008. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  In November, Obama won the presidency with 53% of the  popular vote  and a wide  electoral vote  margin. His election sparked street celebrations in numerous cities in the United States [ 125 ]  and abroad.     Election victory       Main article:  Presidential transition of Barack Obama              Obama meets with then-President George W. Bush in the  Oval Office  on November 10, 2008.       On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the general election with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173 [ 126 ]  and became the first  African American  to be elected President of the United States. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] [ 129 ] [ 130 ]  In his  victory speech , delivered before a crowd of hundreds of thousands of his supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park , Obama proclaimed that ""change has come to America"". [ 131 ]  On January 8, 2009, a  joint session  of the  U.S. Congress  certified the  Electoral College  votes, officially declaring that Obama was elected President. [ 132 ]     Presidency       Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama       The  inauguration of Barack Obama  as the forty-fourth President, and Joe Biden as Vice President, took place on January 20, 2009. The theme of the inauguration was ""A New Birth of Freedom,"" commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of  Abraham Lincoln . [ 133 ]   In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda reversing President Bush's ban on federal funding to foreign establishments that allow abortions (known as the  Mexico City Policy  and referred by critics as the ""Global Gag Rule""), [ 134 ]  changed procedures to promote disclosure under the  Freedom of Information Act [ 135 ] , directed the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from  Iraq [ 136 ] , and reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. [ 137 ]  He also issued orders closing  Guantanamo Bay detention camp  ""as soon as practicable and no later than"" January 2010. [ 138 ]     Political positions       Main article:  Political positions of Barack Obama       A method that some political scientists use for gauging  ideology  is to compare the annual ratings by the  Americans for Democratic Action  (ADA) with the ratings by the  American Conservative Union  (ACU). [ 139 ]  Based on his years in Congress, Obama has a lifetime average conservative rating of 7.67% from the ACU, [ 140 ]  and a lifetime average liberal rating of 90% from the ADA. [ 141 ]          Obama campaigning in  Abington, Pennsylvania , October 2008.       Obama was an early opponent of the Bush administration's  policies on Iraq . [ 142 ]  On October 2, 2002, the day President  George W. Bush  and  Congress  agreed on the  joint resolution  authorizing the Iraq War, [ 143 ]  Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally  in  Federal Plaza , [ 144 ]  speaking out against the war. [ 145 ] [ 146 ]  On March 16, 2003, the day Bush issued his 48-hour  ultimatum  to  Saddam Hussein  to leave Iraq before the U.S.  invasion of Iraq , [ 147 ]  Obama addressed the largest Chicago anti-Iraq War rally to date in  Daley Plaza  and told the crowd that ""it's not too late"" to stop the war. [ 148 ]  Although Obama had previously said he wanted all the U.S. troops out of Iraq within 16 months of becoming President, after he won the primary, he said he might refine plans as further developments unfold. [ 149 ]   Obama stated that if elected he would enact budget cuts in the range of tens of billions of dollars, stop investing in ""unproven""  missile defense systems , not weaponize space, ""slow development of  Future Combat Systems ,"" and work towards eliminating all  nuclear weapons . Obama favors ending development of new nuclear weapons, reducing the current U.S. nuclear stockpile, enacting a global ban on production of fissile material, and seeking negotiations with Russia in order to make it less necessary to have  ICBMs  on high-alert status. [ 150 ]   In November 2006, Obama called for a ""phased redeployment of U.S. troops from Iraq"" and an opening of diplomatic dialogue with  Syria  and  Iran . [ 151 ]  In a March 2007 speech to  AIPAC , a  pro-Israel lobby , he said that the primary way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons is through talks and diplomacy, although he did not rule out military action. [ 152 ]  Obama has indicated that he would engage in ""direct presidential diplomacy"" with Iran without preconditions. [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ]  Detailing his strategy for fighting global terrorism in August 2007, Obama said ""it was a terrible mistake to fail to act"" against a 2005 meeting of al-Qaeda leaders that U.S. intelligence had confirmed to be taking place in Pakistan's  Federally Administered Tribal Areas . He said that as president he would not miss a similar opportunity, even without the support of the Pakistani government. [ 156 ]   In a December 2005,  Washington Post  opinion column, and at the  Save Darfur  rally in April 2006, Obama called for more assertive action to oppose  genocide  in the  Darfur region  of  Sudan . [ 157 ]  He has  divested  $180,000 in personal holdings of Sudan-related stock, and has urged divestment from companies doing business in Iran. [ 158 ]  In the JulyAugust 2007 issue of  Foreign Affairs , Obama called for an outward looking post-Iraq War  foreign policy  and the renewal of American military, diplomatic, and moral leadership in the world. Saying that ""we can neither retreat from the world nor try to bully it into submission,"" he called on Americans to ""lead the world, by deed and by example."" [ 159 ]   In economic affairs, in April 2005, he defended the New Deal social welfare policies of  Franklin D. Roosevelt  and opposed Republican proposals to establish private accounts for  Social Security . [ 160 ]  In the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina , Obama spoke out against government indifference to growing economic class divisions, calling on both political parties to take action to restore the  social safety net  for the poor. [ 161 ]  Shortly before announcing his presidential campaign, Obama said he supports  universal health care  in the United States. [ 162 ]  Obama proposes to reward teachers for performance from traditional  merit pay  systems, assuring unions that changes would be pursued through the  collective bargaining  process. [ 163 ]   In September 2007, he blamed  special interests  for distorting the  U.S. tax code . [ 164 ]  His plan would eliminate taxes for  senior citizens  with incomes of less than $50,000 a year, repeal income tax cuts for those making over $250,000 as well as the capital gains and dividends tax cut, [ 165 ]  close corporate tax loopholes, lift the income cap on Social Security taxes, restrict offshore  tax havens , and simplify filing of income tax returns by pre-filling wage and bank information already collected by the  IRS . [ 166 ]  Announcing his presidential campaign's energy plan in October 2007, Obama proposed a  cap and trade  auction system to restrict carbon emissions and a ten year program of investments in new energy sources to reduce  U.S. dependence on imported oil . [ 167 ]  Obama proposed that all pollution credits must be auctioned, with no  grandfathering  of credits for oil and gas companies, and the spending of the revenue obtained on energy development and economic transition costs. [ 168 ]     Family and personal life       Main articles:  Early life and career of Barack Obama  and  Family of Barack Obama              Barack Obama and his wife  Michelle Obama .       In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family. ""It's like a little mini-United Nations."" he said. ""I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac , and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher ."" [ 169 ]  Obama has seven half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family, six of them living, and a half-sister with whom he was raised,  Maya Soetoro-Ng , the daughter of his mother and her Indonesian second husband. [ 170 ]  Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother, Madelyn Dunham [ 171 ]  until her death on November 2, 2008, just before the presidential election. [ 172 ]  In  Dreams from My Father , Obama ties his mother's family history to possible  Native American  ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis , president of the southern Confederacy during the  American Civil War . [ 173 ]  Obama's maternal and paternal grandfathers fought in  World War II . Obama's great-uncle served in the  89th Division  that overran  Ohrdruf , [ 174 ]  the first Nazi camp liberated by U.S. troops. [ 175 ]   Besides his native English, Obama speaks  Indonesian , at least on a colloquial level, which he learned during his four childhood years in Jakarta. [ 176 ]  After the  APEC summit  in November 2008, Indonesian president  Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  related a telephone conversation with Obama in Indonesian to Indonesian media. [ 177 ]   Obama was known as ""Barry"" in his youth, but asked to be addressed with his given name during his college years. [ 178 ]          Obama playing basketball with U.S. military at  Camp Lemonier ,  Djibouti  in 2006. [ 179 ]       He plays  basketball , a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team. [ 180 ]   In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson , whom he later married, when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin . [ 181 ]  Assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, Robinson joined him at group social functions, but declined his initial requests to date. [ 182 ]  They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992. [ 183 ]  The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998, [ 184 ]  followed by a second daughter, Natasha (""Sasha""), in 2001. [ 185 ]  Because of Michelle Obama's employment with the  University of Chicago , the Obama daughters attended the private  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools . When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the private  Sidwell Friends School . [ 186 ]   Applying the proceeds of a book deal, in 2005 the family moved from a  Hyde Park , Chicago condominium to their current $1.6 million house in neighboring  Kenwood . [ 187 ]  The purchase of the property was coordinated with  Tony Rezko , a major political contributor to Obama, who later sold part of the adjacent lot to the Obamas. The transaction attracted media attention because of Rezko's later indictment and subsequent conviction on political corruption charges for unrelated activities. [ 188 ] [ 189 ]   In December 2007,  Money  magazine estimated the Obama family's net worth at $1.3 million. [ 190 ]  Their 2007 tax return showed a household income of $4.2 millionup from about $1 million in 2006 and $1.6 million in 2005mostly from sales of his books. [ 191 ]   Obama is a  Christian  whose religious views have evolved in his adult life. In  The Audacity of Hope , Obama writes that he ""was not raised in a religious household."" He describes his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as ""non-practicing Methodists and Baptists"") to be detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known."" He describes his father as ""raised a  Muslim ,"" but a ""confirmed  atheist "" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."" In the book, Obama explains how, through working with  black churches  as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."" [ 192 ] [ 193 ]  He was baptized at the  Trinity United Church of Christ  in 1988 and was an active member there for two decades. [ 194 ] [ 195 ]   While he has never been a heavy smoker, Obama has tried to  quit smoking  several times, including a well-publicized and ongoing effort which he began before launching his presidential campaign. [ 196 ]  Obama has said he will not smoke in the White House. [ 197 ]     Cultural and political image       Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama       With his black Kenyan father and white American mother, his upbringing in Honolulu and Jakarta, and his  Ivy League  education, Obama's early life experiences differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement . [ 198 ]  Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists  that the debate is not about his physical appearance or his record on issues of concern to black voters. Obama said that ""we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."" [ 199 ]   Echoing the  inaugural address of John F. Kennedy , Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."" [ 200 ]  A popular  catch phrase  distilled the concept: "" Rosa   sat  so  Martin  could  walk ; Martin walked so Obama could run; Obama is running so our children can fly."" [ 201 ]          From left: Presidents  George H. W. Bush , Barack Obama,  George W. Bush ,  Bill Clinton  and  Jimmy Carter  meet in the  Oval Office  on January 7, 2009.       Obama has been praised as a master of  oratory  on par with other renowned speakers in the past such as  Martin Luther King, Jr. [ 202 ] [ 203 ]  His "" Yes We Can "" speech, which artists independently set to music in a video produced by  will.i.am , was viewed by 10 million people on  YouTube  in the first month, [ 204 ]  and received an  Emmy Award . [ 205 ]   University of Virginia  professor  Jonathan Haidt  researched the effectiveness of Obama's public speaking and concluded that part of his excellence is because the politician is adept at inspiring the emotion of  elevation , the desire to act morally and do good for others. [ 206 ]  Obama used these communication skills in a series of weekly internet video addresses during his pre-inauguration transition period; [ 207 ]  he has suggested he will make a series of broadcast and internet addresses similar to  Franklin D. Roosevelt 's famous  fireside chats  throughout his term as president to explain his policies and actions. [ 208 ]   Many commentators mentioned Obama's international appeal as a defining factor for his public image. [ 209 ]  Not only did several polls show strong support for him in other countries, [ 210 ]  but Obama also established close relationships with prominent foreign politicians and elected officials even before his presidential candidacy, notably with then incumbent  British Prime Minister   Tony Blair , whom he met in  London  in 2005, [ 211 ]  with  Italy 's  Democratic Party  leader and then  Mayor  of  Rome   Walter Veltroni , who visited Obama's Senate office in 2005, [ 212 ]  and with  French President   Nicolas Sarkozy , who also visited him in  Washington  in 2006. [ 213 ]   Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album   Grammy Awards  for  abridged   audiobook  versions of both of his books; for  Dreams from My Father  in February 2006 and for  The Audacity of Hope  in February 2008. [ 214 ]   In December 2008,  Time  magazine named Barack Obama as its  Person of the Year  for his historic candidacy and election, which it described as ""the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.""

You can disagree about free trade. You can disagree about a lot of things. But when you say gay people are  pedophiles and rapists , that is not a simple disagreement: it is a stupid, hateful position that, say, a President-elect should stay miles away from.    Barack Obama's choice of Rick Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration is dreadful. His  explanation  is, if possible, even worse. He shrinks Warren's grotesque comparisons down to a ""disagreement,"" as if we were talking about ethanol subsidies. But we are not. In fact, we are not even talking about marriage rights, we are talking about demonizing an entire group of Americans for the purpose of religious indoctrination, political gain and financial profit. Or doing so out of sheer hatred and idiocy. Or both.    During this year's primary, Obama suddenly realized after 20 years that his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, said things that were so beyond the pale that it was worth throwing him under the political bus, and shunning him forever. What those things were, besides loud snippets taken out of context, is not clear, but I am pretty sure Wright has never falsely accused anyone of pedophilia, rape, incest and bestiality, no matter how over-the-top his style may occasionally be. But Wright was scary to lots of people, most of them white, whose fear of a black planet overrode any rational analysis (starting with the fact that if the bourgeois Obamas attended Trinity, that in itself was a pretty sure bet that the church was not fomenting an Afro-centric revolution.) But Obama did what he had to do not to lose too badly in Pennsylvania and Ohio, kicking Wright to the curb, ostensibly because he was "" outraged "" by the pastor's comments.     That Wright appears to have been replaced by Warren in Obama's heart says a lot about the president-elect's rootlessness and shifting identity. Within a year, he has gone from relying on the advice of a virulently progressive African-American pastor in a Chicago church, to being ""friends"" with an arch-conservative, bigoted, white pastor from Orange County, and handing the latter the most visible platform a religious leader in America can behold, the presidential inauguration.    Obama's inclusiveness was always conditional, as evidenced by the Wright affair. Obama  says  we have to ""create an atmosphere where we can disagree without being disagreeable;"" but is there anything more disagreeable than being called an incestuous rapist pedophile? There are plenty of people who are not invited to the inauguration, are not part of Obama's circle, and are certainly not asked to give the invocation. If not, we would all be howling at the presence of the good people from the Aryan Nation, the Nation of Islam and sundry other groups. But these groups make the mistake of not only being deeply homophobic, but also of spewing hatred towards a whole slew of other segments (women, Jews, African-Americans, Catholics, Christians, white people, etc). Were they to stick to vilifying gay people, as Warren does, they would be golden, and may even find a place at the all-inclusive Obama table. There is clearly no group in America, perhaps besides Muslims, who could be vilified so openly and officially, and be told to get over it in the name of agreeing to disagree.    Obama's clinical interpretation of his ""disagreement"" with Warren's hate-speech makes it sound as if he and the pastor are Ron Kirk and Hilda Solis, respectively the nominated US Trade Representative and Labor Secretary, jauntily sparring over free trade with Colombia. That shows a horrible misunderstanding of the state of gay America, or perhaps a case of political cynicism gone way, way too far, even by Washington's loose standards. Two weeks ago a man was killed in New York for being gay, "" a lynching in Brooklyn ,"" the  New York Times  called it. Gay people and those perceived to be gay make up  one in six  of all reported hate crimes in the United States (and far more go unreported.) Do we really think that there is not a cause and effect between demonizing gay people and the beatings and maimings and murders they suffer disproportionately for being hated? And does Obama really want to be complicit in this persecution? And does he really want to be known as a chief contributor to the well-oiled campaign to deprive gay people of some of the most basic of rights?    We are told that Joseph Lowery, the prominent African-American minister and civil rights leader, will also be involved in the inauguration, and he is a strong  supporter  of gay rights, including marriage. That's good, but what is this inauguration, some kind of daytime talk show (or CNN at any time for that matter) where every time a gay (or gay friendly) person is featured, there has to be a counterpoint, usually someone who thinks gay people should all die because it says so in the bible? By the way, we are also told that FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME there will be a  gay marching band  at the inauguration. Now that really makes up for being called a pedophile.    Obama, smooth talker that he is,  stumbled  in his response to questions about Warren's involvement, finally mumbling something about his ""consistent"" support of ""equality for gay and lesbian Americans."" Even that meek pronouncement was a bit of an overstatement: if he opposes same-sex marriage, he is by definition not in favor of equality. Perhaps more importantly, you definitely lose all right to call yourself a supporter of gay rights when you associate yourself so closely with a man who hates gay people. There is nothing more for Obama to say on the subject, except to apologize, explain that he was misguided and/or misinformed, withdraw his invitation to Warren, and never be seen with him again.    In one fell swoop, even before his inauguration, Obama has succeeded in matching Bill Clinton's single worst moment of cynicism, his gratuitous attack on Sister Souljah. And that is exactly what is most painful about Obama's elevation of Warren to ""America's pastor:"" the gratuitousness of it all. If all goes well, he is four years away from his next election. He received far more backing in time and money from gay people and their supporters than he ever could from Warren's congregation, as  Jane Smiley  aptly put it. At least Clinton was in some trouble (wasn't he always?) when he lashed out at Sister Souljah. This of course does not make it better, but one could at least pretend that his desperate need to cling to power blinded him to the racism of the occasion.     Obama, by contrast, is on top of the world. What does he need Warren for at this very moment? The small, short-term advantage he gets from associating so closely with a hate-mongerer gives us a pretty good idea of where gay people stand in the president-elect's moral and political calculations. It wasn't always so of course, as I recall at least one fundraising event at the home of a gay couple where Obama raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars at one of the roughest moments of his campaign. There were also the millions of hours of volunteer work put in by gay people all over the country, and endless donations and endorsements.    And we did all this despite sometimes profound misgivings about Obama's  position on same-sex marriage , with which he ""disagrees."" He never could really tell us why, or wouldn't tell us why, hiding behind the circular argument that marriage is between ""a man and a woman."" It is high time that instead of simply swallowing our pride, we put our money and votes where our mouth is, and that is simply not with those whose opposition to our rights is based in political calculation, cynicism, or a highly misplaced injection of religion into public policy. When we have misgivings, let's listen to them and act on them. Let's not take a wink-wink nod-nod approach to securing our rights: it makes us look weak and does not work. Let those who ""disagree"" with our very being do so at their own expense. And let those who disagree with hate do so loudly, clearly and consistently, or fail to do so at their own expense. And let us start by walking away from an inauguration at which we will have to sit (or stand a mile away) and watch the man we put so much hope into betray us so deeply in the first seconds of his presidency. For those who insist on going, a hotel room and two train tickets from New York to Washington are newly available.

Gay teens facing rejection from family and friends commit suicide at a rate at least 3 times higher than hetero, it is estimated a gay teen attempts suicide every 5 hours.  If I were to call this a gay holocaust I would be labeled as an extremist nut, but why?  2.  Broken Families.  The swishy stereotype still promoted by the media and even many gay activists/supporters themselves is responsible for a huge number of gay men staying in the closet, getting married and often destroying the lives of the str8 woman they use as ""beards"".  The high profile cases like the NJ governor are the tip of a very very big iceberg.  3.  HIV Transmission.  The self-hatred of homophobia increases the likelihood of self-destructive behavior among gays.  And because of all the men who stay in the closet who don't identify as ""gay"" and get HIV education, they spread HIV at higher rates and infect unknowing female partners.  It's even worse in minority communities, where the increased homophobia we witnessed in the Prop 8 vote results in higher infection rates, Black men are 12% of the population but account for 50% of new HIV infections.                                                                                                                                               Reply                                                                    Favorite                                   Flag as abusive                                                                     Posted 02:49 PM on 12/25/2008                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                     +                                                                                                        LaClem  See Profile   I'm a Fan of LaClem          I'm a fan of this user                                          permalink                                                                                                                                                                                        OOPS!

Equality for gays won't happen without it, so it's good.    I'm gay, and although I'm not pleased about the Rick Warren deal, I also think about things in a longer, more mature timeframe than politics usually demands. Evangelicals comprise a huge proportion of America's population, and they hold political sway. We must reach out and convince them that gays are normal, moral, and loving humans via our actions and our uncontroversial, healthy, productive lives.    After 8 tortured years of division and Dubby, who listens to nothing outside of his self-deluded concept of God, we need to dialogue with evangelicals. When they really start to know us and respect us, they'll incrementally drop their opposition to us. Not all of them, not all at once, but over a decade or two the majority will significantly shift.     So in that forward-thinking spirit, I choose to not get upset over this. Elevating Warren and his megachurch to this prominent spot will force some examination and revision of their stances over time. This is a tactic within a greater strategy.    No one who worked to elect Obama is going to get everything they want. Obama is an ally. Let's not let spite, bitterness, and disil  "

Already Obama has angered some liberals for selecting Rick Warren to speak at the inauguration festivities. Actually, he already has irritated some of his supporters by appointing intelligent thoughtful people to his cabinet instead of party hacks. Keeping Robert Gates really irked some of the more extreme members of the Democratic party, who view him simply as a retainer from a poisoned administration and not a guy whos just as willing to admit when things are going right as when things are going wrong. Obama’s promise to change Washington D.C. by including all voices was echoed by all of his supporters, but when he began to do just that, well, people began to jump ship.   I think the first thing you, dear reader, should do is read  a post written by Melissa Etheridge  concerning Obamas choice to pick Rick Warran to speak at the inauguration. She supports Obamas decision and speaks very highly of Rick Warren. The next thing you need to do is look at  the headlines concerning the President-Elects pick  at The Huffington Post. You can read them all if you want, but after skimming the headlines, I dont think youll need to read more than one or two. Youd think he had asked Pat Robertson or James Dobson. One post calls Obama a bigot, which is rather interesting given the fact that hes made his own views on the issue completely clear, and almost all of them call Warren a bigot. There are a few posts that defend Obamas pick, but most of them condemn his choice and say that Warren is a gay-bashing hater, more or less.   Well, it is understandable why so many gay rights activists and liberals are upset by Obamas pick, or to be more specific, are upset by Rick Warren in general. While no one could say that hes not a humanitarian, he certainly is a social conservative. He told Etheridge that he had a difficult time supporting Proposition 8 in California, but decided to do so because, while he thinks that everyone deserves the same civil rights as everyone else, he also believes that the institution of marriage exists between men and women, and not between members of the same sex. Many people in the gay and lesbian community view this as a tacit approval of discrimination. They see marriage as a civil right, while Warren does not. The underlying implication is that people who disapprove of a particular practice disapprove of the people who participate in that practice as well.   Conservatives have taken a different approach. As I stated, Warren and those who support Proposition 8 do not think of marriage in terms of civil rights. In fact,  a CNN exit poll  shows that African-Americans favored Proposition 8 by 70%, and Latinos by 53%. While many people have taken this as an opportunity to argue that black people are homophobes (because apparently you can tell what all black people think about homosexuality by looking at a poll concerning gay marriage, and not homosexuality specifically), what you  can  infer from the poll is that some of the people most concerned with civil rights dont view this as a civil rights issue. Conservatives (for the most part) see the institution of marriage as a privilege granted by the state that can, and should, be regulated, similar to the way in which drivers licenses are regulated.   There are those in the middle, this author included, who believe that the United States government oversteps its bounds when it involves itself in the institution of marriage. In fact, it was only a few hundred years ago that European governments began to take a roll in marriage. The governments only interest should be that only two individuals register as a union and that they are both of legal age to do so. After that, all things should be left up to whatever church the person or persons seeking marriage attend to qualify or not to qualify the relationship as a marriage.   The argument that we would be changing the definition of marriage if we were to allow homosexuals and lesbians to marry is compelling, but misguided. Marriage has gone through hundreds of changes throughout history, from polygamy (which still exists today) to monogamy, from arranged marriages to free marriages, from marrying young women to old men to making it illegal for people considered to be adults to make sexual advances on a minor. To say that codifying marriage as between one man and one woman will prevent it from ever changing is absurd.   I have a hard time saying that marriage is a civil right in the same way that blacks have the same rights as individuals as whites, or Latinos, or Koreans, or Mongolians, or whatever. I think that everyone has the right to marry who they love, but the institution of marriage is just that, an institution. If your church doesnt allow homosexuals to marry, I suggest finding another church. And if your government tells you that it has the right to decide the fates of social codes that that government has no practical interest in, I suggest you tell your government to back off and remember its place. The right to seek marriage is a fundamental right. Whether or not you  can  get married should be up to your particular denomination or faith, and not the United States government.   So where does this leave us in terms of the issue facing Obama and one of his decision to ask Warren to speak at the inauguration? Weve identified what some of the prevailing viewpoints concerning homosexual, or gay, marriage are, but does that get us any closer to deciding whether what Obama did was to be interpreted as bigoted or as an endorsement of Warrens more controversial views? In part two of this post Ill discuss what I think we should make of this Obama/Warren complex. And Ill look at some of the outlying problems that this issue drags into the light.                      1 Comment »                                                   Search                             Recent Posts              Who Is (Senator) Al Franken?

Put politics aside for the moment and take a look at  Panarin’s 2010 map of the United States  (above) that breaks the world’s longest-lasting democracy into four regions, none of which include Alaska (given to Russia) or Hawaii (see note below). In essence, the map serves as a foundation upon which member schools of the Intracontinental Collegiate Athletic Association (ICAA) — successor to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) — can reorganize into four super regions as follows for college football purposes:     “THE TEXAS REPUBLIC”  will feature all six teams from the Big 12 Conference’s South Division as well as two-thirds of the teams from the Southeast Conference;         “ATLANTIC AMERICA”  will include all of the traditionally-weak teams from the North Atlantic coast area as well as four excommunicated teams from the former SEC (i.e., Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and Vanderbilt);       “THE CENTRAL NORTH-AMERICAN REPUBLIC”  roster of teams will be populated by teams from both the Big Ten Conference and the Big 12’s North Division as well as a handful of lesser squads; and       “THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC”  will field what can only be described as a reincarnation of the Pac-10 Conference to which Boise State and a handful of other Top 25 programs will be added.       How will the new playoff system work?   Teams will be limited to playing ten regular season games during a season that ends on the second weekend of November. Beginning on the final non-Thanksgiving weekend of November, the four top teams from each region will battle for their respective region’s top spot in a single-elimination playoff. Finally, winners from each of the regions will move on to an intracontinental playoff.   The team judged by a combination of computer and human polls to be the “best overall team” among the four finalists will play the lowest-rated team and the second- and third-best teams will battle each other. From those games, two winners will emerge to play in the Intracontinental Championship.   NOTE:  Due to the fact that Hawaii will, according to Panarin, be given to Japan or China, the University of Hawaii Rainbows will remain a team without a conference that has a difficult time scheduling games. So sorry.   * * *   See also:  College Football Bowl Game Predictions Offered                Tags:   ·  Alaska ,  atlantic america ,  big 12 ,  big 12 conference south ,  big 12 north ,  big ten ,  big ten conference ,  China ,  College Football ,  college football playoff ,  football playoff ,  hawaii ,  hawaii rainbows ,  how the u.s. will split ,  icaa ,  igor panarin ,  intracontinental collegiate athletic association ,  intracontinental playoff ,  japan ,  kentucky ,  national collegiate athletic association ,  NCAA ,  pac-10 ,  pac-10 conference ,  panarin ,  Russia ,  russian academic ,  russian professor's prediction ,  single-elimination playoff ,  South Carolina ,  southeast conference ,  tennessee ,  the california republic ,  the central north-american republic ,  the texas republic ,  university of hawaii ,  vanderbilt ,  Wall Street Journal                        1 response so far ↓                            1       Consider the Russian View, When Selling Into Russia « MARPA         // Dec 29, 2008 at 2:18 pm                 [...] the lighter side, Bob McCarthy has suggested that this “US-Break-Up Theory” may have unwittingly provided a solution to those calling [...]                                              Leave a Comment                      Name       Mail       Website                                                                                                             BMW Category / Search      Select Category    ‘SCRATCH OFF’ by BOB MCCARTY    ABC    ABInBev    Abortion    About BMW    ACORN    advertising    Affirmative Action    Afghanistan    Agriculture    Air Force    Airline Industry    Al Franken    Al Gore    Al-Qaeda    Alberto Gonzalez    Alternative Fuels    Alzheimer’s    America For Sale    America’s Future    American Idol    Americans for Tax Reform    Andrea Mitchell    Animal Rights    animals    Anti-Tobacco Campaigns    Anti-War Protesters    Apple    Apple iPhone    Appliances    Army    Art    Associated Press    Automobile Industry    Automobiles    Bank Failure    Barack Obama    Barney Frank    BBC    BBC World Have Your Say    BCS National Championship    Bernie Mac    Bill Clinton    Bill Richardson    Bill Russell    Billy Graham    Black Liberation Theology    Blogging    Bob Barr    Bobby Rush    Books    Border Security    Bowling    Branson    Breaking News    Brian Williams    Bruce Chapman Productions    Bureaucracy    Burma    Business    Cambodia    Campaign Advertisements    Campaign Contributions    Campaign Tactics    Cancer    Capital Gains Tax    Capitalism    Carly Fiorina    Caroline Kennedy    CBS    Cecilia Munoz    Cell Phones    Census Bureau    Charitable Efforts    Charlton Heston    Charter Schools    Chicago    Chicago    China    Chris Matthews    Christianity    Christmas    Chuck Hagel    Cinco de Mayo    Citizen Journalism    Claire McCaskill    Cloning & Stem Cell Research    CNN    Coal    Coca-Cola    Coffee    Cold War    College Baseball    College Basketball    College Football    Collin Powell    Computers    Concealed Carry    Condoleezza Rice    Congress    Conservatism    Constitution Party    Consumer Product Safety Commission    Corporate Income Tax Rate    Corruption    Costs of Goods and Services    Council on American-Islamic Relations    Credit Card Companies    Credit Crisis    Crime    Cuba    Culture    Customer Service    Cycling    Dairy Products    David Letterman    Debate    Defense    Defense Contracting    Defense Spending    Democrat National Convention    Democratic Party    Dennis Kucinich    Depression    Dick Cheney    Diet    Diplomacy vs. Appeasement    Disgruntled Employees    Dish Network    Dish Network    Disney    Dividends Rate    Dmitry Medvedev    Documentary    Domestic Terrorism    Down Syndrome    Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.    Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.    Drudge Report    E-mail    E-mail Scammers    Earthquake    eBay    Economy    Ecumenical Movement    Education    Election Fraud    Electronics    Eliot Spitzer    Ellen Moran    EMILY’s List    Energy    English as Official Language    Entertainment    Entitlement Programs    Environment    EPA    Equal Rights Amendment    Eric “Digger” Dowling    Eric Holder    ESPN    Ethanol    Ether    Ethics    FAA    Fair Tax    Fairness Doctrine    Faith    Fast Food    Federal Budget    Federal Spending    Fidel Castro    First Amendment    Flat Tax    Flight 93 Memorial Project    Flip This House    Focus on the Family    Food and Drink    Food Crisis    Foreign Exchange Programs    Foreign Films    Foreign Policy    Fourth of July    Fox News Channel    Fran Drescher    France    Frank Caliendo    Frank Marshall Davis    Frank Sinatra    Fred Thompson    Free Speech    Funding Sources    Funeral Industry    Gambling    Gas Prices    Gen.

I've hesitated to blog about it for the past couple of days, but as this story has grown bigger and bigger, it's time I stepped out and said something.  It just needs to be said.    Calm down.  Rick Warren is not a big deal.  This tempest in a teapot will only harm our community.    With so many prominent bloggers, activists and politicos outraged, I realize this post won't be the most popular I've written.  As I've mulled this over the past few days, certain key elements fell into place for me; I wonder why our leadership didn't realize some of these basic facts before they started pounding on Warren.                       As Jim Ross writes at the Sentinel in his post, "" Obama Creates New Cabinet-Level Post for Rick Warren "":       OK, not really.  But one would have thought so, judging by the reaction to Obama's recent announcement concerning Warren.  The outrage from the left and the coverage from the media has gone off the charts, at a level that would have been appropriate if Obama had named him, say, Secretary of Religion and Faith and then endowed him with the powers to shape the administration's social and moral agenda.  But that's not at all what Obama did.  He simply asked Warren to deliver the invocation at the inauguration.  Here's what will happen:    Warren will stand up and pray something nice and religious and patriotic sounding that is carefully crafted to offend as few people as possible, and then he will sit down.  The next day, he will leave Washington and go back to being a pastor and an author.  That's all.  It will be that innocuous.        1. Rick Warren Is Not the Biggest Threat to the LGBT Community    Warren is a popular preacher and author.  He's a religious right leader.  He is a pompous windbag, a liar, and a homophobe.  Big f--king deal.  Anti-gay, lying, pompous preachers are a dime a dozen.  Warren's soapbox is larger than most, but 98% of these mega-ministers end up crashing to earth surrounded by prostitutes, drugs and dollars with the careers in ruin.    LGBT folk are losing their jobs in several states just because they're queer.  The violence against trans folk in Memphis, TN and across the nation calls out for more attention and aggressive watchdogs.  Our adoption and parenting rights are under attack.  HIV infections are surging. We are dying.    Don't Ask Don't Tell should be a priority.  A fully inclusive ENDA should be plotted and planned and put in place.  Figuring out a realistic response to today's HIV/AIDS environment is needed.  Lord knows, there's a whole helluva lot of work to do on trans issues.  Resolving the racism, sexism, ableism and other undesirable traits in our own community should be a priority.    But Rick Warren's short prayer?  That's tiny in the grand scheme of things.    2. Doesn't This Signal That Homophobia Is Acceptable To Obama?    No.  Not at all.  It signals that Obama is a shrewd politician.    One of the biggest presents Obama can get during the first few months of his presidency is the goodwill of the Right.  Picking Warren, who took flack during the election for his willingness to engage Obama, shows the evangelical leadership that Obama is willing to repay his favors.    Saying a prayer at the inauguration is small potatoes.  Stop someone on the street and ask them who gave the invocation the last time.  Or the time before that.  How many times has Billy Graham spoken the opening prayer?  Do  you  know?  It's not as if Inauguration preachers are big memory making opportunities.      Can you name the  other  gay-friendly  minister speaking at Obama's inauguration ?  I couldn't.  I scanned five Bilerico posts about the topic and didn't see him mentioned.  I found the answer at the  New York Times  blog.    Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Lowery.    Hell, we don't even care about him.  Neither does Joe Six Pack.    The other thing most Americans don't care about is LGBT rights.  Face it, most straight people just don't give a s--t about our issues. They are asleep to our struggle, obviously, our Prop 8 would not have passed.  Or Amendment 2.  Or Prop 102.  Or...    While this would have signaled to evangelical leaders that Obama is willing to treat them generously and they could, understandably, take that to mean the constant stream of homophobic comments were a-ok, I doubt that the average American would have noticed.  If our community had kept their mouth shut on this choice to lead a prayer, Warren wouldn't get the free publicity, the goodwill from evangelicals,  or the constant media repetition of the ""Obama is dissing the gays"" mantra.    We've told more Americans about Obama's signal than would ever have noticed on their own.  We've made ourselves the victim before an uncaring audience that thinks this is a big whooptie-doo.  After all, several of them attend a church where their minister probably says the same or more on a regular basis.    3. We Look Like Novices    As the LGBT community is trying to flex our muscles, this is not the time to look like a 75 pound weakling.  By mewling and kavetching about Rick Warren's minutes spent praying to an invisible man in the sky, we didn't flex our biggest muscle - our brains.    Everyone knew that Warren would not be replaced.  His selection had already been announced publicly, and replacing him would have been too big a scandal.  The new president does  not  make mistakes.  Remember?    So what did we hope to gain?  The only person I saw asking this obvious question, was  Stonewall Democrats Executive Director Jon Hoadley on the Huffington Post .       Our community -- at least from what my inbox has seen -- has been quick to share our anger at this choice. But while advocates --especially the LGBT netroots -- are rightfully telling the incoming administration that this isn't right, our community has been slow to share a solution.    Unfortunately, this is a pattern in modern LGBT advocacy. We saw the same anger over rumors earlier this year that former Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia (the architect of opposition in 1993 to service by openly-gay military personnel) was being considered for the position of Vice President. Our community loudly said ""No to Nunn!""- just as we said ""No to Nunn!"" to similar rumors in 2004 and 2000. Yet, in saying""no"" our community failed to share what we could say ""yes"" to.    If we want to enact pro-equality policy and change, we need to take a page out of Harvey Milk's playbook: we have to give them hope. We need to say what we want, not just what we don't want.       The only thing I've heard that we wanted was a cabinet-level pick of an openly gay person.  Big deal.  (I'd rather Obama pick his team based on their qualifications than any tokenism.  If he picked all black, disabled lesbians as advisors, that's fine; as long as they are the best people for the job.  I'd rather not be a token for his administration.)  Now, all the cabinet spots are filled so we didn't get that either!    So that leaves us with what demand?  That the transition team do the impossible?  They won't dump Warren.  We're not asking for anything else.  We're just complaining to hear ourselves whine.    If You Can't Stand the Heat, Get Outta the Kitchen    Politics is a rough and tumble sport.  We've been handed our asses politically lately.  We helped get Obama elected only to get marriage amendments shoved down our throats.    We're angry.  We're prickly.    We're sensitive.    Many of us led with our hearts and not our brains on this one.  We got upset and started sending out press releases and writing blog posts and going on TV and we poured out the well documented ills of Rick Warren and his loathsome beliefs.      What we should have done is head straight to Obama and pointedly ""put him on notice.""  We should strategize ways to get Don't Ask Don't Tell repealed quickly, how to get the votes for a fully-inclusive ENDA, how to get an inclusive hate crimes bill to Obama's desk ASAP.  We hold his feet to the fire to  really show  his support of our community by passing these important life-saving bills.  Quickly.    But this temper tantrum that we're throwing publicly?  It's not worth it.  There's no winning either the political or the pr battle.    We need to shut the hell up and go to work on the issues that matter.  A ""nice and religious and patriotic sounding that is carefully crafted to offend as few people as possible"" prayer?  That's not it.     Editors' note:   Did you like this post?

I regularly challenge our state party; it's earned me the ire of most Dems for putting Queer above Dem.    This just isn't the right strategy for this case.  It's political reasoning that I'm advocating.

Nick |  December 19, 2008  4:28 PM Reply to this comment                               Bil, you are absolutely right. This really isn't a matter for people to get their panties in a knot over.     Warren is going to give a invocation. Aprayer, if you will. He's not at the inauguration to preach, or to proselytize, and won't be given a chance to.  Keep in mind that Warren invited him to debate McCain, which Obama wisely accepted; Obama may not have won many converts over that night, but Warren could have just blown him off and didn't.     Yes, Warren's no friend. He's certainly opposed to same sex marriage and other GLBT rights issues. However, there are far, far worse that could have been picked. Warren does support enhanced funding for social welfare programs, for instance.  He wouldn't have been my pick (I'd have chosen Katherine Jefferts-Schori or Gene Robinson, but I'm an Episcopalian and Obama isn't), but I was relieved that Obama didn't pick a TD Jakes, Joel Osteen, Bernice King, or Harry Jackson, say.      The important thing will be what Obama does about hate crimes, DADT, ENDA, and repeal of DOMA. I am prepared to wait and judge on his performance, and give him a chance to perform.  I believe he will do okay. We will be watching.                       Polar   |  December 19, 2008  4:31 PM Reply to this comment                           Agreed.  Entirely.                    Bil Browning  |  December 21, 2008  1:20 PM Reply to this comment                                         One of the biggest presents Obama can get during the first few months of his presidency is the goodwill of the Right.        He won't get it.       Can you name the other minister speaking at Obama's inauguration?I scanned five Bilerico posts about the topic and didn't see him mentioned.        Well, scan my post from yesterday or use the google function next time.       We've told more Americans about Obama's signal than would ever have noticed on their own.        That's OK, the signal wasn't for them. It was for us, the leadership of the Religious Right, and the establishment political media.       Everyone knew that Warren would not be replaced. His selection had already been announced publicly, and replacing him would have been too big a scandal.       Well, that's not the point. The point is responding to one off these assaults to either (a) prevent another one in the future or (b) get the community to wisen up. And since Obama has made, as a direct result of being pushed by LGBT people on this issue, some of the most significant and specific pro-LGBT statements a president has ever made in the history of the country, I'd say it looks like it's having an effect.       If You Can't Stand the Heat, Get Outta the Kitchen       At this point, the only person blogging on this site telling people to quiet down is you. I mean...       What we should have done is head straight to Obama and pointedly ""put him on notice.""       I take this as a stamp of approval on this whole mess? Because this is what thousands representing hundreds of thousands to millions of people putting him on notice looks like. Unless you mean that it should have been some sort of quiet, backroom deal that he could have reneged on at any point because no one knew it happened, I think this is the process you're looking for.    The Right has been throwing temper tantrums for years to get what they want, although they usually call it ""drumming up the base"" instead. Getting angry, expressing your anger so that other people are angry too, and then having them express their anger.    It looks ugly. It's not fun to stand in the middle of, I understand. But I don't see a competitive alternative. Work ""on the issues that matter,"" while charmingly vague, isn't a course of action that is mutually exclusive with expressing our anger at this event.                      Alex Blaze  |  December 19, 2008  4:31 PM Reply to this comment                           It appears that many on the evangelical right aren't exactly enthralled by the Rick Warren selection (or more properly, his acceptance) a couple of examples from E-Mails a pundit for the Christian Broadcasting Network published:    ""Unless Rick Warren has changed, he is very disappointing in the pro-life cause. Just ask pro-life leaders their opinion. He doesn't like to deal with it at his church. It just seems funny that he is known as 'pro-life' when he largely ignores the subject and teaches others to do the same. I fear God for these 'men of God'. We have lost 50 million babies, and most won't say a word. Reminds me of Nazi Germany or our slavery days. Very few spoke out. It was more comfortable to keep quiet.""    Here's another:    ""I have had about all I can stand of Rick Warren's double standards. WHOSE side is he really on anyway? I'm beginning to think all he cares about are his questionable political connections. When I saw your article announcing his participation in ""that one's"" so called inauguration ceremony it absolutely sickened me. It isn't enough Obama is so full of himself that he ""thinks"" he's God. - Apparently now Rick Warren believes he is too. This is a complete mockery of all things sacred.""    Right-wing panties apparently snit, too.

Man!  I'm glad we're on the same side of the issue on this one, Alex dear boy.  ;-)                    Scott Kaiser |  December 19, 2008  7:45 PM Reply to this comment                        I'm with you on this one, Alex.  Bil couldn't be more wrong.  I had written a rather pointed version of that that seems to have disappeared into cyberspace but it boiled down to the fact that moral failings are a big deal for someone for whom a big part of their job is the exercise of a bully pulpit -- that Hils was right when she questioned Obama's good sense about reaching out -- terming him naive (which is the nicer alternative to his just being a jerk who doesn't give a rat's ass that giving a bigot such as Warren such a visible position of honor gives aid and succor to those who hang our children on fences to die and ignores the effect of WarrenRobertsonDobsonEtAl's constant demeaning dehumanizing of us that digs deep into too many of our souls resulting in self-destruction both quick and slow and embeds itself deeply into the fabric of our society to keep us the highest per capita victims of hate crimes and youth homelessness.)    I talked, too, about how it is not the loud outcry that's politically naive -- it's ending it too soon that would be.  That we're not on Joe Sixpack's or Obama's radar is reason all by itself to pump up the volume -- that discussion always favors the under-discussed-but-on-the-right-side-of-the-moral-universe such as we are, even if it doesn't appear so early in that discussion -- and it is early.      The issues of morality only tend to get to the forefront after the frivolous has run its course.  Then the cracks in the veneer of civility carefully slathered on the Warrens like so much bad heavy makeup start to show even to the big media whores who have tried to ignore the obvious.  Hell, even Mrs. ""I'd Better Not Stand Up For My People Cause CNN Likes Its People Safely Semi-Closeted"" Rosen even opined -- albeit timidly -- on Anderson Cooper last night that being the victim of Obama's political expediency could be considered ample justification of our complaints.    So get those inauguration tix but use them to boo Warren up close and call Obama the liar he is when he makes his inevitable claims of being a vehicle for inclusive change.  You'll end up eating balogne sandwiches instead of crab puffs that evening -- but you'll be at least guaranteed to be spending the night with a more honest class of folks.    Who knows, if we tell the truth and that spoils the party, maybe they'll decide we're worth at least consulting next time.  If not, what's he going to do, not sign DADTDP repeal or whatever crap is passing for real civil rights legislation for us these days?  Get real!                Marla R. Stevens |  December 19, 2008  7:57 PM Reply to this comment                           Well, scan my post from yesterday or use the google function next time.       I did Alex.  All three of them that published before mine.  You have Lowrey in a blockquote of the Obama statement in one post.  You never mention him yourself.    Man Does Not Live By Doughnuts Alone    Responding to Obama: We Can Disgree without Being Disagreeable   (this is the one with Lowery in the blockquote)    Obama Picks Arch-Homophobe Rick Warren    As for this quote:       That's OK, the signal wasn't for them. It was for us, the leadership of the Religious Right, and the establishment political media.       I thank you for agreeing with me.  You nailed it.  By blowing this up into a brouhaha, we've made sure everyone thinks that Obama is actually anti-gay and condones the right-wing homophobes.  We've made it an issue when it could have been handled without a public shaming of our community.       The point is responding to one off these assaults to either (a) prevent another one in the future or (b) get the community to wisen up. And since Obama has made, as a direct result of being pushed by LGBT people on this issue, some of the most significant and specific pro-LGBT statements a president has ever made in the history of the country, I'd say it looks like it's having an effect.       So the point of complaining about Warren and turning this into a major media story is to get positive statements from Obama?  We already had that.  And since the controversy broke, the most he's said is that he supports civil unions.  Wow.  let's take  that  to the bank...    I say this because your point that the purpose should be ""(a) prevent another one in the future or (b) get the community to wisen up"" is too politically naive.  It won't prevent another one.  Politics will always trump; alliances must be made to govern.  And ""get the community to wise up?""  Seriously?  Did Prop 8 do that?  Did any of the other amendments?  The lack of legislation in some states?  Ellen coming out?  A federal DOMA?  DADT?  The numerous hate crimes against the LGBT community?  GLAAD parties?  HRC e-mails?  Marches on Washington?    No.  This won't either.    It's a rookie mistake to shake and shout over Warren.  Our leadership should have known better.

Don't say anything because if we do, then they will think that and then these people will perceive this about us and we will look bad and god knows we don't want to look bad...which in effect brings us right back to the topic at hand.    By saying nothing and/or carefully mincing around trying to manage our appearance we look like cowards at best or at worse we look disingenuous.      Why would anyone - anyone - not have a response to being poked in the eye?      The Mormons/xtians have been peeing their pants about reactions to prop 8.  Why is it that there is always a double standard applied to LGBTs - by our allies, by the media and worst of all by ourselves?    That is what you propose Bil by trying to control everything and everyone's reactions.  WE look like amateurs?  Instead of professionals?  Instead of looking like an Obama type that can lie and spin his way through a dust cloud by saying he is evolved when we considers bigotry to be an example of inclusion?    We have a responsibility to encourage each other to stand up for what is right and Obama is wrong, you are wrong, and Rick Warren is evil.    Silence in the guise of nuance is actually cowardice.                     patrick  |  December 21, 2008  5:31 PM Reply to this comment                                             I agree with much of what you say, Bil, and as you've probably noted, I've chided Waymon a bit and challanged him to think about the impact of what I consider to be our community's tendency to overuse the term ""hate"" so much that it leaves no room to really throw the ""hate"" book at Fred Phelps.    At one time in my younger days I once went to a counsellor concerning anger control and he told me to take my frustrations out by beating a pillow with a bat or tennis racquet.  Since I don't like feathers or loose foam pieces littering my bedroom I've discontinued that practive, but I've lately taken to really putting down lots of elevated thoughts on paper just to see what they look like, and then before I send them to Veritas Rex (ooops, I didn't mean to go that far...) I just delete the whole thing.  But I feel lots better.    Unfortunately the send button is always very easy to press, and I suspect in understandable frustration that it's been exercised a lot lately when maybe a re-read (at least) would have been in order.

I stand by my comments.  every one them.  calling a spade a spade is not wrong.  What Warren spews is hate, even if he smiles nicely at the end.

To be fair to Waymon, the reason Phelps exists is so that everyone can throw the hate book at them and let everyone else who has the same beliefs but is more mediagenic, like Warren et al, off the hook.    Maybe we should form an extra whiny LGBT org and then we can all say that they're the whiny ones, not us?

Presenting Warren front and centre as part of the first official act of the Obama Administration is not just wrong, it is also stupid.    For a world longing for the end of extra legal policies that Bush pursued, Warren and his advocacy of violating Hague IV by assasinating the Iranian PM is sbsolutely the least reassuring gesture that Obama could have made.    For the Gays and Lesbians languishing in Nigerian prisons because of laws pushed for by Warren's friend and ally Peter Akinola, Warren's presence is a kick in the teeth, as is our mixed response to him.

clueweb09-en0006-12-10785	"                         < Previous:  Rapture Bonds    Up:  Site Index      Next:  The Roots of the War on Christmas  >             Rick Warren? Shame On You, Obama!                  Via multiple sources ( Greta Christina ,  Pam Spaulding ,  Glenn Greenwald ,  Americans United , as well as others), this unpleasant news: President-elect Barack Obama has apparently chosen megachurch pastor Rick Warren to give a speech at his inauguration day.   If you're not familiar with Rick Warren, or if you only know him as the author of  The Purpose-Driven Life , here's a few of his greatest hits:   • Warren has been a dedicated enemy of marriage equality, equating gay rights to incest and pedophilia ( source ), and was a fervent supporter of the pro-bigotry Proposition 8. He is against civil unions for gay couples ( source ). He has even, arguably, given his support to African Christians who want homosexuality to be illegal ( source ).   • He's also rabidly anti-choice, comparing abortion to the Holocaust ( source ).   • Just for good measure, he's said that  atheists are not qualified for the presidency :    ""I could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says, 'I don't need God,'... They're saying, 'I'm totally self-sufficient by [myself].' And nobody is self-sufficient to be president by themselves. It's too big a job.""    • And, oh yes,  he's a creationist .   If Warren seems more approachable or more reasonable than the hate-spewing religious right leaders we all know, it's only because he presents his bigotry in a kinder, gentler facade. His church does occasionally discuss other issues, such as AIDS in Africa or global warming, but it takes more than that to earn my respect when he still spends so much time and energy pounding the religious right's standard causes.    In fact, Warren has said that only five issues are "" non-negotiable "" - his opposition to abortion, stem-cell research, cloning, gay rights and euthanasia - which puts him firmly in the camp of the other religious hatemongers. Apparently, if push came to shove, he would discard efforts to help the suffering of AIDS orphans, prevent the genocide in Darfur, or avert the looming threat of climate change in order to prevent gay couples from having civil unions. For all the high-minded media talk about the ""new evangelicals"", Warren is not substantially different from the old guard, and his beliefs are grounded in the same bigoted and ignorant worldview that motivates his predecessors. He's said himself that the difference between himself and Jerry Falwell is mainly ""a matter of tone"" ( source ).   Inviting him to speak at the inauguration is a terrible decision. The fact is, I understand why Obama made it - I think I grasp the political considerations that went into it - and I  still  think it's a bad decision.   I suspect Obama thought that, by inviting Warren, he would seem sensible and centrist in the eyes of the public, and might peel off some evangelical voters from the Republican coalition. And since Warren's speech is a symbolic gesture only, he probably thinks that his policies once in office will make up any lost goodwill among progressive voters.   As I said, I assume that was the Obama team's political calculus, but I think the real effects will be different. I think this invitation will be viewed as a slap in the face by liberal and progressive Americans - the very people who supported Obama's bid for the presidency and worked to put him into office. And while it may generate some fleeting goodwill among evangelical voters, I have no doubt that the vast majority of them will vote Republican in the next election anyway. Meanwhile, the lost goodwill among Obama's supporters may not be as easy to win back as he apparently thinks. It's very likely that he'll need us again to pressure Congress to support his proposals. Will we be willing to work again for him, having been denigrated in this way?   Insulting your allies for the sake of a futile gesture to your sworn enemies is a bad idea and bad politics. And I suspect the  blowback  has been far more intense and sustained than Obama's team anticipated, causing controversy and embarrassment where they had hoped to avoid both. Although I still consider Obama's election a tremendous net positive for America, this shameful pick may be a sign of how much work we'll have to do in the next eight years to prod our leaders toward implementing a truly progressive agenda.

As Greta says, asking Warren to give the invocation is not sitting down and talking with Warren, it's endorsing and legitimizing his views. I sent a letter to Obama:   Dear President-Elect Obama:   I was disappointed to learn that you have asked Mr. Warren to deliver the invocation for your inauguration. Mr. Warren holds many anti-progressive views; this was shown most recently by his endorsement of Proposition 8 in California, which removed the right to marry from gay and lesbian families.   By asking Mr. Warren to speak at your inauguration you are implicitly saying that the rights of non-heterosexuals are unimportant to you and your administration. Please reconsider your decision to have Mr. Warren speak for you and for the nation.   Sincerely,   [Leum]   Wish I'd mentioned his anti-abortion and creationist views when I sent that letter. Those wishing to e-mail our President-Elect can do so  here . I've heard some people argue that having Warren speak was up to an inaugural committee made up of Senators, but I'm sure that they wouldn't've had Warren speak if Obama had asked them not to.   Comment by: Leum |  December 19, 2008, 12:52 am              Amazing. For all of history, the first thing anyone will see in a new centrist-liberal Presidency for change and fairness is a miserable, tired, bloated, self-important, bigoted and swaggering reincarnated Jerry Falwell mooning over ""God,"" Christ and the morality of ancient superstitious sheepherders. What a horrible spectacle and and a depressing start of a once hopeful Obama era.   Comment by: John Nernoff |  December 19, 2008, 12:56 am              Yeah, but at least some of the Religiots are getting their knickers in a twist over the gay and lesbian band that he will have marching/performing at his inauguration parade.   Comment by: KiwiInOz |  December 19, 2008, 1:40 am              It's sad to see people giving up so quickly on such a great hope. One disappointing decision and everyone throws in the towel. Great supporters you are. I think one of the changes we need to start with is giving grace to the presidents that we elect. Do you have any idea what his job is like?   And what a strong anti-christ attitude John! If Hitler were here you would be dead already! So quit complaining and start doing something to support your new elected president!    Words are powerful and thoughts create energy that can effect people anywhere. That is why Bush is having such a hard last 2 years, everyone in America or, a good portion and, all across the globe are projecting hate toward him! Have you seen him on TV? He is like a Rocky after 10 rounds! He isn't saying it's easy but he made it this far! And he was our president for all these years because he was strong enough!    If you don't support your president and his decisions, like Obama said ""Agree to disagree"" but work together and figure out some thing that is positive. He has alot more on his plate than just your target market.   Comment by: Matthew |  December 19, 2008, 8:16 am              I suppose it is inevitable in the U.S that some kind of religious endorsment is expected for the presidency.

Comment by:  Steve Bowen  |  December 19, 2008, 8:55 am              I was shocked at first when I heard this, but upon later reflection, I see it as not really a big deal. It's more strategic in my opinion. Folks, this is a christian nation, whether we like it or not. Obama's choice is an attempt to send a message that his administration is inclusive of all Americans, which it should be. If he can make the christian majority feel better about him, that's great. It's better than alienating such a huge portion of our county, especially at a time when we need to work together.   Let the religious right have a spot at the table so they can have the opportunity to discuss their absurd ideas among other more rational ideas. Then it will be clear just how ignorant they are.

Comment by: TheMightyThor |  December 19, 2008, 9:53 am              Folks, this is a christian nation, whether we like it or not.    It may be a nation comprised primarily of Christians, but it's not a Christian government.   For once I'd like our President to acknowledge the fact that it is a  secular  government that he's running, that prayer is an individual and private matter between a person and his particular supernatural entity of choice and has no place at government events, that government will run quite well without constant invocations to the same non-existent entity, and that picking one particular god by necessity excludes all the others (and the possibility of none) and therefor excludes the people who believe in them, and oh by the way, also voted for him.   Comment by:  Spanish Inquisitor  |  December 19, 2008, 10:37 am              We shouldn't forget that in the debates both Obama and Biden said that they do not support gay marriage.   Comment by:  OMGF  |  December 19, 2008, 10:51 am              I also sent a letter to Obama.  Just how ""inclusive"" can we be until it makes an standard of decent and good meaningless?  Shall we invite a skinhead to speak at the inauguration?  Surely, one could have found a person with Warren's good points and not the bad.   HB, quit spreading that  lie  about the US being a Christian nation!  We aren't and never have been.  If it were so, why didn't the creators of the Constitution say ""For laws, See Bible"".  And if it were a nation comprised ""primarily of Christians"", SI, why do all of these Christians think any sect but their particular one isn't Christian at all? Funny how Christians claim these huge percentages of themselves when convenient, but when it comes down to ""are these true Christians?"" darn few make the cut.   Comment by: velkyn |  December 19, 2008, 10:55 am              We know that Warren and Obama see eye to eye on at least a few things:   IFILL : Lets try to avoid nuance, Senator. Do you support gay marriage?   BIDEN : No. Barack Obama nor I support redefining from a civil side what constitutes marriage. We do not support that. That is basically the decision to be able to be left to faiths and people who practice their faiths the determination what you call it.   Vice-presidential  debate  on October 2, 2008.   Really, if you'd been paying attention, Warren's selection should not be all that much of a surprise.  Personally, I see it as a  quid pro quo  for Warren inviting Obama to his  pastor's forum .   Or did you miss that too?   Comment by:  Robert  |  December 19, 2008, 10:59 am              @ Spanish Inquisitor, velkyn   I am well aware that the government is secular  in theory , however, we all know that most people are christian. Hence my use of ""christian nation"". We also know that their beliefs are irrational, hence my understanding that they are a cohesive unit with some issues and independent with others (such as biblical interpretations). Therefore, I think they join ranks, generally, on key issues such as the socially conservative ones. Mr. Warren aligns these people on these issues. Look at the prop 8 mobilization effort. Too bad the pro-LGBT folks couldn't mobilize in such a way.   Mr. Warren holds sway over lots of these people. Obama chose him (or allowed him to be chosen) to speak. The fosters the notion that his administration will be open to dissenting opinions, something Bush's administration would not do.    As for allowing skinheads to speak: nice extreme example. But let's deal with reality, mkay?   Comment by: hb531 |  December 19, 2008, 11:22 am              I don't know. I'm kinda on the side that see it as a symbolic gesture. After a few months Warren's speech will be forgotten, and the religious right will still be saying hateful things about Obama. However, I am interested in hearing exactly what Warren will say. It could be an opportunity for him to spout his nutty beliefs. Maybe, he'll say something that'll make people say ""Wait a sec, that can't be right!""   Comment by:  Robert Madewell  |  December 19, 2008, 11:30 am              hb, ""reality"" is not what you are describing. Even *I* know that ""all"" Christians don't do anything as a unit.  I see little different between a skinhead espousing hatred for Jews and Warren espousing that same hatred. It seems that the skinhead is already seen as evil where Warren is wrapped in the assumed ""goodness"" of religion.   Comment by: velkyn |  December 19, 2008, 12:01 pm              ...I have no doubt that the vast majority of them will vote Republican in the next election anyway.    Exactly. Which is why I think this is a stupid move from an otherwise slick politician.    Unless, of course, he has much more in common with Warren than we're willing to believe.    During the campaign, I didn't like much of what I heard coming from Obama. This is unexpected and disappointing, but does fit the whole picture I have of him. I merely held out some slight hope that once elected he'd feel free to be a little bit different.   But, he isn't.   Comment by: Polly |  December 19, 2008, 12:05 pm              I'm not so sure whether this was directly Obama's decision, or one by a congressional committee of some sort, and if it were made by someone else, I can see how it would be more difficult, politically speaking, for Obama to reject Warren after he's chosen and the public is aware of it, than it would have been to have just chosen someone more reasonable to begin with. In any case, it is pretty ridiculous that Warren and his views are getting such an endorsement at the inaguration.   Comment by:  Maria  |  December 19, 2008, 12:33 pm              Who would be a better choice?  How would you want this done?   This isn't fascetious.  I'm curious.  I agree that Warren is too far right.   Regards,   Wayne   Comment by: Wayne Essel |  December 19, 2008, 1:00 pm              Maybe a better way to word that last question would be ""What would make you feel like an owner/particpant in the innauguration process?""   Wayne   Comment by: Wayne Essel |  December 19, 2008, 1:07 pm              I emailed my 2-cents worth (forgot to save the text in the webform). Besides complaining of Warren's selection, I added why have an invocation at all, since we're supposedly a secular nation.  I don't expect a change in his selection, but hopefully his issue-trackers record one more tick in the ""non-religious voter"" column...   Comment by: Juliana Marie |  December 19, 2008, 1:30 pm              I said it before, and I'll reiterate it one more time: politicians are firmly in the pockets of special interest groups - whatever power promises them more money/votes/dirt on rivals gets the perks and manipulates the politician to its will.  Obama is no exception, contrary to the popular belief of all those political idealists out there he is just another politician and Warren merely represents another special interest asserting dominance over the political sphere.   I knew form Nov. 2nd onward that Obama was going to bow to pressure from the special interests - in spite of his promise of ""change"" - because his job isn't serving the ""good"" of the public: his job is (and always was) to get elected, so he will do what he must to keep his office.  To those who honestly believe that he would be different from the others, you have my sympathies but don't say that you weren't warned in advance...   Comment by: Christopher |  December 19, 2008, 1:50 pm              I'm trying to be neutral on this, despite my loathing of Rick Warren (his ""debate"" with Sam Harris a year or two ago was stomach-turning), because I recall being disappointed when Billy Graham did the invocation for Clinton's second inauguration. That came to nothing, as I hope this will, and Graham is a *hell* of a lot more famous than Warren.   Comment by:  Will E.  |  December 19, 2008, 1:55 pm              I don't know why everybody's so surprised. Obama never hid his religious views during the campaign.  Obama and blacks in general have a strong religious culture.  I believe after the Rev. Wright scandal, this is a very strategic move by the Obama camp.   Comment by: goyo |  December 19, 2008, 1:59 pm              But is it really such a strategic move? The left tries to appeal to the right but you'd never see the right try to appeal to the left. They couldn't give a fuck. You think if McCain won, he'd be having John Shelby Spong up there for *his* inauguration? Fuck no. (I guess maybe I'm not as neutral as I'd like to be.) This won't win much if any support from the people who didn't vote for Obama; it's simply upsetting his base.   Comment by:  Will E.  |  December 19, 2008, 2:09 pm              Obama has been slapping progressives in the face since he won the Democratic primaries.  This doesn't surprise me much.  Obama is a politician rather than a leftist saint.  Don't expect him to be something he isn't.   Comment by: Kaltrosomos |  December 19, 2008, 4:30 pm              If this was merely a symbolic move, it was really bad symbolism. ""Let's begin a historic Presidency -- a Presidency supposedly based on inclusiveness and ending divisiveness -- by giving a great, high honor to a hateful, divisive bigot.""   And if it was a strategic move, it was really bad strategy. ""Let's court people who already hate us, by alienating people who are strongly inclined to support us and treating them as if we can take their support for granted. Especially people (LGBT people) who recently suffered a terrible blow and are already feeling angry, raw, and alienated.""   it was a bad move all around. Obama grossly underestimated how easy it is to lose the good will of people who support you. All it takes is a hard slap in the face.   As to what Obama could have done about it after the hullabaloo started: No, he couldn't rescind the invitation. But he could have privately asked Warren to voluntarily step down, with an ""I don't want to distract from this historic day"" excuse.   Comment by:  Greta Christina  |  December 19, 2008, 4:51 pm              I think the choice of Warren to speak is a slap in the face of  progress.  It's great that Obama is trying to join people together and all, be ""inclusive,"" etc. but he's reaching out (and giving an open mic and a huge international audience) to a jackass who isn't interested in reaching back. Warren has made it clear he's nothing more than Robertson with a friendlier public persona-----a con artist of the highest magnitude who would send this country back to the dark ages if given the chance, all the while pocketing millions. I just can't generate an ounce of respect for assholes like that.   Obama is only angering his own base, as someone above mentioned, the religious right won't vote for him in any case. There isn't any rule about invocations, most inaugurations haven't had one, so why bother?   Big mistake.   Comment by: KShep |  December 19, 2008, 6:14 pm              I am annoyed, and not surprised, that in all the debate and dicussion I've seen about this on TV I haven't seen even one person questioning the need to have a religious statement at a  secular  ceremony for someone elected to a  secular  position. Oh, well. I'll just whine on my blog about it. :)   Comment by:  Chris Swanson  |  December 19, 2008, 7:02 pm              Matthew, a good response to this article.    Perhaps Obama is going to be all right. He must be pinching himself to see if this is all true. He was basically unopposed in the Senate election, now he will be president. I didn't want him, but he is our president, and I'll be 100 percent for him.    Leum, thanks for the link, but I will write Obama a snail mail letter - it just may get read. e-mail is too easy and lazy, and there must be thousands of them.    ""In fact, Warren has said that only five issues are ""non-negotiable"" - his opposition to abortion, stem-cell research, cloning, gay rights and euthanasia - which puts him firmly in the camp of the other religious hatemongers""   Of the five issues above, the legal killing of the unborn is the most abhorrent. Strange thing is, Obama voted for partial birth abortion, and also voted to withhold medical treatment for children born alive after a botched abortion. Perhaps Obama is just being political or just maybe he intends to become one of the greatest presidents after the fashion of Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest and openly Christian presidents ever.(no, I am strong supporter of the non establishment clause)Good luck Obama in trying to keep 300 million egocentric people happy.   Comment by: John |  December 19, 2008, 8:42 pm              The symbolism is moot--this is again Obama spitting in the face of a group of very real Americans (GBLTs) and an insult to anyone who believes in medical and ethical progress.  This was STUPID, STUPID, STUPID.     There's an old saying, ""Don't sh*t where you eat.""  He would do well to remember this; being an elected official, our system requires us to take an antagonistic watchdog stance on everything he does and says.  This can't start too early.  He's not a great hope, he's not a messiah.  He's a human being with an espoused set of political views that some fear he is conveniently shedding since the people voted him into office, under the tired guise of ""reaching across the aisle.""   I'd be so bold as to say someone should look into the basic legality of having a religious speaker ""blessing"" the inauguration of our president in the first place.  A case should be made against such nonsense.  No time like the present.  Tradition be damned.   Comment by: nfpendleton |  December 19, 2008, 10:03 pm              Yes, I was upset when I discovered that Warren is delivering the invocation for Obama's inauguration.  You know what, it's a prayer.  He's not giving a speech.  It's almost insignificant.  Yes, it is symbolism.  Obama was many more religious voters than Kerry did four years ago -- this is NOT bad strategy.  Obama promised to be the President for all Americans, and now he's doing what he said he'd do.  He didn't say he was going to be a leftist George W. Bush.  He said he'd cooperate with other ends of the political spectrum, and now that's exactly what he's doing.     Yes, Obama could've gotten someone more moderate than Warren.  Is it a logical premise to then deduce that Obama isn't a liberal and won't help progressives?  No, it isn't.  Folks, quit panicking and get over yourselves.  This is nothing more than a conciliatory gesture designed to get some of these ""I-think-Obama-is-a-closet-Muslim-drill-baby-drill-Sarah-Palin"" types off of his back for at least five minutes.   Obama is trying to at least build a facade of unity.  It's not bad strategy.   John, you have no idea do you?  You know nothing about global warming.  Scientists have verified that ten of the ten hottest years on record have all occurred since 1970.     You're saying that since there were a few cold winters in the 1970s, it's impossible that the Earth is getting warmer?  Please.  Study what scientists have learned about global climate change before you continue commenting on it.   Comment by:  Teleprompter  |  December 19, 2008, 10:36 pm              Teleprompter: if you haven't read Greta's brilliant article on this, do so ( linky ). The problem with Warren's giving the invocation is that it's one of the highest honors he could be given. In a time of trouble, in which a religious man will want God's help more than ever, he chooses Warren to ask God for help. It is  not  insignificant, and it's insulting to Obama, and American Christians in general, to say it is.   I'm not panicking over this, just disappointed that Obama (hopefully*) fails to realize how significant this choice is. I think that Obama's presidency will be something I can look back on as a turning point in American history, by voicing our concerns, we can help ensure that it that.   *If Obama does realize it, then we are going to have some serious problems with gay rights, women's rights, and science education in the next four years (although nothing like as bad as the last eight, or as bad as four under McCain/Palin would have been).   Comment by: Leum |  December 19, 2008, 11:02 pm              Obama is (probably) a Christian, so it's not surprising that he's following the tradition of having prayers spoken at his inauguration. The issue we should be focusing on, as others have already pointed out, is not  who  is praying, but  why  anyone is praying at all. An inauguration is a purely civic ceremony. If government people would remember that and keep the superstitious crap out of it, then Obama and his team could spend their time doing more critical tasks than balancing the number of liberal and conservative pastors (both Protestants, by the way, so we're not being broadly inclusive here) who will be bringing their superstitions to our secular ceremony.   I'm not throwing in the towel on Obama's presidency, by the way, but I am watching him and I intend to do everything in my power to hold him accountable. He won my vote this time around, but he will have to spend the next four years earning it again. This one decision does not lead me to believe that he won't do so. He made a mistake and he'll make more before it's all over. The best I can do is watch how things balance out overall and speak up, when necessary, to either praise or admonish him as circumstances warrant.   Comment by:  the chaplain  |  December 19, 2008, 11:48 pm              This somewhat confusing and disappointing situation raises a deeper and more trenchant issue; what is it about the supposedly rational human mind, which Obama evidently has, that permits irrational, frankly crazy notions to enter and spoil the logical progression of good ideas and useful procedures? Why is Obama overtly religious, if only mildly so? Is it a ploy to enable him to ""get along"" with the majority -- a useful trick to not impair vote getting? If so, doesn't this make him into a devious hypocrite? If not, and he is sincerely pious, by what logical and intellectual mechanism did he accept the supernatural? This phenomenon has been called mental compartmentalization or bimodal thinking (or other terms I can't quite remember). One part of the brain doesn't synchronize with the other part.    Can anyone explain this, or am I overreacting?   Comment by: John Nernoff |  December 20, 2008, 12:14 am              Who would be a better choice? How would you want this done?   My preference would be for no religious invocation at all. That's a custom that only began in the twentieth century, and the president is supposed to be representing all American citizens, not just the Christian ones.   However, if an invocation absolutely must be given, I'd much prefer someone with a genuine progressive record, like a civil-rights leader such as Joseph Lowery. Lowery is going to speak at Obama's inauguration, but Warren is still being given pride of place.   Comment by:  Ebonmuse  |  December 20, 2008, 12:43 am              John, you have no idea do you? You know nothing about global warming. Scientists have verified that ten of the ten hottest years on record have all occurred since 1970.    You're saying that since there were a few cold winters in the 1970s, it's impossible that the Earth is getting warmer? Please. Study what scientists have learned about global climate change before you continue commenting on it.   I see you've met John.  While your advice is sound, the way he's conducted himself so far suggests that he will respond to being asked to educate himself before commenting about the way Clark Kent would respond to being asked to insert five kilograms of kryptonite as a rectal suppository.   For instance:   Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest and openly Christian presidents ever.   Um, about that...   Comment by: Alex Weaver |  December 20, 2008, 4:44 am              Shame on Obama?  He's paired the invocation of his inauguration with a benediction by Rev. Lowery, someone who is also a Christian but has the bare minimum in common with Warren with regard to theology and social beliefs.   It's obvious why Obama has chosen to do this, and in the same position Obama is in, I would do exactly the same thing.  See, I still know swarms of conservatives and evangelical Christians who swear up and down that Obama is a Muslim.  The Conservapedia still has a sub-section about how ""Obama would likely be the first Muslim President""  (See here:  http://www.conservapedia.com/Barack_Obama  )    So what's to happen when ""one of their own"" get's up there in front of Americans and gives the invocation for Obama?  Well, for starters, millions of evangelicals heads will explode.  But, but, but he's a Muslim!  (Of course, in all serious I figured out a long time ago that saying ""Obama is a Muslim"" was just the conservative codeword for saying ""Don't vote for him!  He's black!)   Comment by: canadacow |  December 20, 2008, 8:25 am              Alex,   One more thing, I haven't studied Lincoln all that much. I have read his Gettysburg Address. I suggest you broaden your reading, and visit other sites, not only atheist ones - try reading The Gettysburg Address, and then tell me about Lincoln's lack of religion. Atheists, religious, and political sites are all selling their own beliefs, and therefore are to be taken with ""a grain of salt."" As The Bible says, ""each man must build his own house.""    I have educated myself by visiting this site. I particularly enjoyed reading ""The Jesus Puzzle"" link, and some comments have sent me off in a different direction of inquiry.   Comment by: John |  December 20, 2008, 12:26 pm              I think I'll stay out of the global warming discussion.  :^)   But I do want to post this, which is from Bill in Portland Maine on Daily Kos. He really puts Warren's idiotic beliefs in perspective:   Rick Warren: We must love gays. But only the sick ones.   Obama spokeswoman Linda Douglass defends Warren thus and so:        ""Warren has been a passionate advocate on behalf of the poor and has really led evangelicals to champion the interest [sic] who suffer from HIV and AIDS...""   Interesting coincidence. Last week a local pastor here in Maine, Neil Farrar, wrote an op-ed against gay civil rights in which he echoed the same thing to distract from the fact that his main arguments are crap:        My own father, as a singles pastor in a megachurch in Texas during the '80s, told me of the countless times that he would go to the hospital and visit young men in AIDS wards who were dying; he told me how he would hold these men in his arms as they gasped in terror for their last breath.  Fear did not take my father there, but rather love.   Here's my question: why is love and compassion so freely offered by conservative Christians when a gay person is dying, but so stingily withheld when a gay person is healthy and headlong in the pursuit of happiness? Why are we only worth a damn to them when we're gasping in terror for our last breath? What kind of mind makes such a distinction?  Healthy one minute: ""Damn you.""  Sick the next: ""We love you.""  Talk about passive-aggressive.   Homosexuality is equivilent to incest and pedophilia in Rick Warren's mind. The countless gay couples legally married in California and Massachusetts are non-existent to him. That marriage in America is, ultimately, a civil institution, not a religious one, is immaterial to him. That marriage has been redefined constantly over the centuries matters not a whit to him. That reparative therapy is a disaster because homosexuality is an immutable characteristic falls on deaf ears. That many gays and lesbians are faithful Christians who love and contribute to their churches is lost on him.   Gay people do absolutely everything our country asks of them. From paying their taxes to donating their time and money to their communities; from raising happy, well-adjusted kids to covertly (for now) serving in uniform and putting their lives on the line in defense of Rick Warren and his followers. And yet the only way to get these conservative Biblical cherry-pickers to pat us on the head is when we're down for the count.   What cowardice.   Dont get me wrong. Anyone who offers aid and comfort to people with HIV/AIDS---indeed, any affliction---deserves praise and thanks for doing that. No question about it. But why must gay people have to become profoundly weakened before the Rick Warrens and Neil Farrars of the world extend a hand and finally treat us as brothers and sisters? Why can't they embrace us---and our partners and families---right now, and acknowledge our ongoing and significant contribution to the American story? Why are they so damned afraid of us when we're thriving?   Warren is just another fear-mongering megalomaniac who holds himself up as ""Mr. Compassionate"" when it helps keep the cash rolling in but in reality couldn't give a rat's ass about anyone who thinks differently. I'm not holding my breath, but I hope to see the day when a political leader finally has the stones to tell someone like Warren that giving other people the same rights you have  doesn't mean your rights have to be taken away.   Would have been nice if Obama could have promoted ""diversity"" by having people who actually support it speak at his inauguration.   Comment by: KShep |  December 20, 2008, 5:38 pm              Global warming denialism is not on-topic for this thread.   Comment by:  Ebonmuse  |  December 20, 2008, 6:18 pm              Why is it surprising Obama would do this? He spent years attending a church run by a man who believes that black brains and white brains are wired fundamentally differently. Hell, Rick Warren is almost moderate in his views.   After all, look what Obama himself said about gay marriage,   ""I'm a Christian. And so, although I try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue, I do believe that tradition, and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman.""   How is that any different substantively than what Rick Warren believes, other than people who are fans of his seem to see themselves in Obama and diminish or dismiss the importance of these sorts of public statements.   Comment by:  Brian Carnell  |  December 21, 2008, 12:22 am              Disappointing, not surprising. I'm not at all surprised that Obama picked Warren, I just don't think he should have done so. Just because someone does the expected doesn't mean we shouldn't criticize it, otherwise they'll never change. And with Obama, there's a chance that our criticism will actually prevent similar choices in the future, which is more than we could say for Bush (and we still criticized him, even knowing it was futile).   Comment by: Leum |  December 21, 2008, 12:37 am              ""I'm a Christian. And so, although I try not to have my religious beliefs dominate or determine my political views on this issue, I do believe that tradition, and my religious beliefs say that marriage is something sanctified between a man and a woman.""   How is that any different substantively than what Rick Warren believes, other than people who are fans of his seem to see themselves in Obama and diminish or dismiss the importance of these sorts of public statements.   Although Obama has said he's not in favor of gay marriage, he's voted for civil unions for gay couples and said he opposed Prop 8. He's also in favor of gay adoption and repealing DOMA. None of those are positions shared by Warren. Substantively, their positions are actually quite different, which makes it all the more disappointing that he's chosen a bigot like Warren to speak for him.   Comment by:  Ebonmuse  |  December 21, 2008, 2:02 am              What Mathew and some of what Teleprompter said. What Ebon said about Lowery, too. Anyone happen to catch Warren on Colbert Report a few months back? I'm not the biggest fan of some of the public statements I've heard from Warren.   However, to balance the Holocaust comparison, Warren also said about abortion:    Its not something I protest out on the street about. Its something you deal with individually as rational civil people...""    The guy's not down at the local doctor's office blocking footpaths and doorways, which is always a plus.   Also, if you follow the ""Warren's a creationist"" link in the OP,  Nation  reporter Sarah Posner has taken Warren majorly out-of-context when she says,    ""..he declared that voting for a ""Holocaust denier"" (i.e., someone who is pro-choice) is a ""deal-breaker"" for many evangelicals.""    Now, Posner may well have access to source material we don't, but here's Warren in context speaking to Jewish American Senator Charles Schumer:    And I went around the room and when I came to Chuck Schumer I said, Chuck, how bad, if you had a candidate and he was right in every single area that you agreed with but hes a Holocaust denier? Theres no way youre gonna vote for a holocaust denier, Warren recalled telling the Jewish American politician. Thats a single-issue issue for you.   Warren used the term to draw an analogy for the importance of abortion as a single-issue issue for himself and his congregation - not to compare pro-choice people to Holocaust deniers. It's easy to miss things like that when clearly motivated by distaste for religion, though.    As for Obama, many have noted he's pledged to be the President for 'all Americans,' yet it seems people here think their opinions deserve special preference from the man, as if he should pander specifically to their worldviews. Like someone said, quit panicking and get over it. At least outwardly, I see Obama as somebody sincerely seeking to mend cultural rifts. No matter who he picked, some position will be emphasized, which means all others are de-emphasized. I mean let's realize how hard the man's job is.   OTOH, I think progressives' dissatisfaction may be somewhat empathize-able. The last thing you want to see is more of the same if you're a progressive, and Obama's choice could be viewed as a step in this direction. But to the extent that people seem to be flipping out? Not IMO.    I think Obama might even denounce some of the hateful criticisms in this thread. Now, I'm no fan of the religious right, believe me, but doesn't anyone here realize that we have but one planet to live on together and learn to get along? While I realize the dichotomous and divisive nature of American macropolitics, along with other nonsense, all this talk about 'sworn enemies' and much of what's been used to describe Warren seems mildly hypocritical while simultaneously denouncing Warren as a hateful bigot.    As an aside, I see far too many people who whine and complain about 'hate' and 'bigots' around here, but seem equally willing to give it out to their own pet pariahs, typically Christians. The message many send here perhaps without realizing it is, ""Hate should not be tolerated - unless of course it's against those that  we  hate.""

I haven't noticed any atheists around here saying that Christians should not be permitted to marry, adopt children, or hold office. I  have  noticed plenty of sharp criticism of Christians by atheists, which is sometimes called ""hate"" or ""bigotry"" by people who really don't understand the meanings of those words.   Comment by:  Ebonmuse  |  December 21, 2008, 3:16 pm              Ebon,   Wow.. you're really going to insinuate that DA is immune from the same poison the rest of the world so easily chokes on? Or that I misunderstand the definitions of hatred and bigotry?    If you want to deny the true hate and bigotry that occasionally flows around here, that's fine, and I can understand why. Also, definitions of hate and bigotry do not mandate political action as in your examples; do you understand the meanings of the words? And I'm not talking about the sharp criticisms. Those are fine and welcome in my book. Lastly, mentioning the very real religious hatred and bigotry that exists in society is irrelevant and does nothing to address my claim of similar sentiments here. Such attempts to divert the argument could be perceived as red herrings.   From Wikipedia: Hate ""...describes intense feelings of dislike. It can be used in a wide variety of contexts, from hatred of inanimate objects (e.g. homework, vegetables) to hatred of other people, or even groups of people.""   Also from Wikipedia: ""A bigot is a person who is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles or identities differing from his or her own, and bigotry is the corresponding attitude or mindset.""   Nope. Not one scintilla of that around here! ;)   Comment by:  cl  |  December 21, 2008, 4:01 pm              I am sick and tired of people saying I ought to tolerate intolerance. I am more than tolerant of the right to say homosexuality is an abomination, but that doesn't mean I have to tolerate having people take away the right to marry. If Warren had merely said that gays were going to Hell, or that it was a bad lifestyle, cl's criticism would be valid, but Warren's gone further. He's refused to tolerate gays having basic rights, and tolerating  that  is incompatible with real tolerance.   Comment by: Leum |  December 21, 2008, 4:14 pm              As for Obama, many have noted he's pledged to be the President for 'all Americans,' yet it seems people here think their opinions deserve special preference from the man, as if he should pander specifically to their worldviews   This is hilarious. No atheist or secular progressive I've heard of has demanded ""special preference."" We just want the president-elect, in fact ALL politicians, to stop pandering to people like Rick Warren. It should be plain to see for any thinking person, but it's people like Warren and his followers who are the ones demanding special preference, and getting it, often to the detriment of society at large. You betcha we're tired of seeing progress derailed so that a politician can pander to a group of blathering fools.   Now, I'm no fan of the religious right, believe me, but doesn't anyone here realize that we have but one planet to live on together and learn to get along?   Yes, most of us atheists do indeed feel this way. Isn't it the religious who are forever attempting to enshrine hate and discrimination into law? I don't recall any atheist attempt to legislate any religious belief out of existence, but religious people have time and again tried and succeeded at forcing their convictions onto the general population. And you want US to try and get along? Make no mistake---we  ARE  trying to get along---the Rick Warrens of the world are trying to prevent that from happening. Isn't that obvious?   As an aside, I see far too many people who whine and complain about 'hate' and 'bigots' around here, but seem equally willing to give it out to their own pet pariahs, typically Christians. The message many send here perhaps without realizing it is, ""Hate should not be tolerated - unless of course it's against those that we hate.""   Funniest thing yet. Please try and get this into your head: atheists don't generally  hate  anyone. You will be hard pressed to find any sweeping, unsubstantiated attacks on religious  people  here or on any atheist forum. We  do  attack religion in general all the time, without apology, as it wholeheartedly deserves it. But you seem to want to equate attacking religion with attacking religious people. There is a distinction. Religious people don't usually merit an attack until they use their belief to cause harm---like Rick Warren does. Religious people aren't called hateful, bigoted con artists until they reveal themselves to be hateful, bigoted con artists.

He's refused to tolerate gays having basic rights, and tolerating that is incompatible with real tolerance.   Problem is, my comments aren't about Warren's hatred or bigotry, so their validity does not rest on Warren's character. Furthermore, are you suggesting Warren's hateful or bigoted character precludes the possibility of hateful or bigoted characters on DA? Red herring, and I'll disagree.   KShep,   No atheist or secular progressive I've heard of has demanded ""special preference.""   Then,   We just want the president-elect, in fact ALL politicians, to stop pandering to people like Rick Warren.    IOW, ""I'm an atheist or secular progressive, and I want Obama to pander to who  I  approve of, not who Obama approves of."" Good luck with that.   ...a group of blathering fools.   IOW, I am intolerant of those unlike me.   Isn't it the religious who are forever attempting to enshrine hate and discrimination into law?   No. The hate-filled enshrine hate and discrimination into law, and several possible motives operate upon them besides religion.   ...the Rick Warrens of the world are trying to prevent that from happening. Isn't that obvious?   That may well be true. Problem is, my comments aren't about Warren's hatred or bigotry, so their validity does not rest on Warren's character. Furthermore, as posited to Leum, are you suggesting Warren's hateful or bigoted character precludes the possibility of hateful or bigoted characters on DA? Red herring, and I'll disagree.   Please try and get this into your head: atheists don't generally hate anyone.   I've not made an argument about atheists in general. I've made an argument about particular comments on a particular website. So you've changed the scope of my original argument, then rallied against it, IOW, strawmanned me.   You will be hard pressed to find any sweeping, unsubstantiated attacks on religious people here or on any atheist forum.   Again you change definitions. Please define ""sweeping, unsubstantiated attacks"" and I may be able to respond. You seem to be arguing I can't produce examples of hate and intolerance against believers here, and that's a road you really don't want to go down, IMO.   We do attack religion in general all the time, without apology, as it wholeheartedly deserves it.    I agree, and for that I thank you.   But you seem to want to equate attacking religion with attacking religious people. There is a distinction.    No, actually that's your mind at work. Again, I made a comment in a limited time-space context, to apply to particular people at a particular site. Read the original comment and look for the appropriate quantifiers.    Religious people aren't called hateful, bigoted con artists until they reveal themselves to be hateful, bigoted con artists.   Incorrect in general, and also in the specific scope of my argument. I've been called ""hateful"" here, in the total absence of hateful, bigoted statements, or anything remotely suggesting I was a con-artist.   Now, I'm no fan of the religious right, believe me, but doesn't anyone here realize that we have but one planet to live on together and learn to get along?   Yes, most of us atheists do indeed feel this way.     Well good, a point on which we agree!   Comment by:  cl  |  December 21, 2008, 8:10 pm              cl,   No, I'm not saying that DA can't have hateful or bigoted atheists on it (no comment on whether it does or does not, don't want to go down that road in either direction). What I am saying is that your comments sounded very much like that ridiculous line of ""stop refusing to tolerate my intolerance."" Not your exact words, probably not even your intention, just how it came it (probably in part because I've been reading some very nasty articles lately. It's bad for me, I should stop).   Comment by: Leum |  December 21, 2008, 9:20 pm              IOW, ""I'm an atheist or secular progressive, and I want Obama to pander to who I approve of, not who Obama approves of."" Good luck with that.   Oh, man. Putting words in my mouth? Pathetic. Read what I wrote again:   This is hilarious. No atheist or secular progressive I've heard of has demanded ""special preference."" We just want the president-elect, in fact ALL politicians, to stop pandering to people like Rick Warren. It should be plain to see for any thinking person, but it's people like Warren and his followers who are the ones demanding special preference, and getting it, often to the detriment of society at large.   Where does it say I want Obama to pander to  anyone?   IOW, I am intolerant of those unlike me.   Another attempt to put words in my mouth. I didn't say any such thing. Read it again:   You betcha we're tired of seeing progress derailed so that a politician can pander to a group of blathering fools.   Knock it off.   The hate-filled enshrine hate and discrimination into law, and several possible motives operate upon them besides religion.   Right, sure, but a lot (if not most) of them have religion as their common motivator, which was my point, maybe not so well spoken. I hope you're not actually arguing that religion doesn't motivate people to discriminate.   I've not made an argument about atheists in general. I've made an argument about particular comments on a particular website.   So? That doesn't negate my point.   So you've changed the scope of my original argument, then rallied against it, IOW, strawmanned me.   Learn what a strawman is.   Comment by: KShep |  December 21, 2008, 9:23 pm              IOW, I am intolerant of those unlike me.   No, cl, criticizing people with whom you disagree is  not  intolerant, not even if the criticism is mean and nasty and hurts their fragile feelings. Tolerance does not imply agreeing with someone, or even liking them, which of course is why it's called ""tolerance"" and not ""acceptance"".   ""Intolerance"" in this context means attempting to  rework society's laws  to show favoritism toward people who share your beliefs or punish people who do not. This is a distinction even a child should be able to grasp. Saying ""Christians are brainw  "

In that speech, Obama recited the now famous line borrowed from Deval Patrick, “Don’t tell me words don’t matter.” Obama was correct, words do matter. In fact, words can be very powerful. Given his understanding of how much words matter, it is difficult to comprehend how Obama selected Rick Warren, the pastor of the Saddleback Church, to give the invocation at the inauguration. Rick Warren was a strong supporter of Prop 8 in California and recently said that in his view the relationships of gays and lesbians are equivalent to incest, pedophilia and polygamy. Last night I listened to the debate regarding Obama’s choice of Warren. Obama supporters said that the choice was one of inclusiveness, spiritual bipartisanship and that there is room for everyone under the big tent. These are the same arguments they made last fall when Obama had the anti-gay, ex-gay gospel singer Donnie McClurkin emcee a large public fundraising event in South Carolina. Defending their inclusion of McClurkin, Obama’s camp stressed their vision of ...    more   »                  Leave Comment   |            Permanent Link     |   Cosmos                          Sunday, December 21               Contact Obama and other political figures.

Many actions are currently underway to protest the decision to have Rick Warren on the Inaugural platform, and most of them are lobbying and petition-based strategies, which may not be visible to the public-at-large. LIGHT UP THE NIGHT Events to be held today, which were to bring the Rick Warren issue to the public, may not happen in all areas of the country as originally planned, due to the severe weather conditions that have left large potions of the Northeast and Mid-states buried in snow.

And it's still a day for us to celebrate. But we've got to do something. And I think we've really got to do something from the inside, that shows what a slap in the face this decision is to true dems, obama supporters, campaigners, etc., oh yeah, and to anyone who actually believes in equal rights under the law.  I feel like a total chump. And I feel that Barack is a compulsive conciliator -- a condition which leads him to cede important ground, whether symbolic or concrete, when it's neither even necessary nor moral to do so. In addition to being gay, I work in wilderness conservation. Because of Salazar alone, I was already disappointed and angry today. No policy decisions had been made yet, however, so it wouldn't be fair to assume the worst based on that selection, etc., etc... but this Warren thing is just ridiculous. RIDICULOUS.  So.
