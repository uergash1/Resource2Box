Messenger  is an  advertisement -supported  instant messaging   client  and  associated protocol  provided by  Yahoo! . Yahoo! Messenger is provided free of charge and can be downloaded and used with a generic ""Yahoo! ID"" which also allows access to other Yahoo! services, such as  Yahoo! Mail , where users can be automatically notified when they receive new email. Yahoo! also offers PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service, file transfers, webcam hosting, text messaging service, and chat rooms in various categories.   Yahoo! Messenger was originally launched under the name Yahoo! Pager on  1998 - 03-09 . [ 1 ]   In addition to instant messaging features similar to those offered by  ICQ , it also offers (on  Microsoft Windows ) features such as:  IMVironments  (customizing the look of Instant Message windows, some of which include authorized themes of famous cartoons such as  Garfield  or  Dilbert ), address-book integration and Custom Status Messages. [ 2 ]  It was also the first major IM client to feature BUZZing and music-status. Another recently added feature is customized  avatars .

Messenger announced the release of Yahoo Messenger for Windows Vista as a Beta Release. It includes transparent Glass Windows and a new skin and GUI for the Windows Sidebar and program. Also integrated new tabs for going between different chat windows. As of October 25, 2008,  Yahoo! Messenger for Vista version is no longer available.   On October 29, 2007, Yahoo! Messenger announced the release of Yahoo! Messenger 9 Beta. It features a new and improved interface, new emoticons (also hidden emotions [ 3 ] ), the integration with Flickr account and a new in-line media player which enables the user to view maps, photos and videos from sites like Yahoo! Video and YouTube right in the IM window. [ 4 ]   Yahoo! has announced a partnership with  Microsoft  to join their instant messaging networks. This would make Yahoo! Messenger compatible with Microsoft's  .NET Messenger Service . It also made Microsoft's  Windows Live Messenger  compatible with Yahoo!'s Network. This change has taken effect as of  2006 - 07-13  - Yahoo! Messenger has integrated instant messaging with  Windows Live Messenger  users, and is fully functional.   British Telecommunications' BT Communicator software is based on Yahoo! Messenger. BT Communicator was withdrawn on  2006 - 12-31 . [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Features     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Voice       Main article:  Yahoo! Voice       Yahoo! Voice  is a  Voice over IP  PC-PC, PC-Phone and Phone-to-PC service  [ 6 ] ,  [ 7 ]  provided by  Yahoo!  via its Yahoo! Messenger  instant messaging  application. It is also available for the Mac OS X platform  [ 8 ] .     [ edit ]   Voicemail and file sharing   Yahoo! added voicemail and file sending capabilities to their client. File-sharing of sizes up to 2GB was added to Yahoo meseneger     [ edit ]   Plug-ins   As of 8.0, Yahoo! Messenger has added the ability for users to create plug-ins (via the use of the freely available  Yahoo! Messenger Plug-in SDK ), which are then hosted and showcased on the  Yahoo! Plug-in gallery .     [ edit ]   Yahoo! Mail integration   Yahoo! plans to integrate  Yahoo! Mail Beta  and Yahoo! Messenger. [ 9 ]  Conversations will be archived and stored in the same manner as emails. This allows users to search within their chat logs easily, and to have them centrally stored and accessible from any computer.     [ edit ]   Chat   All versions of Yahoo! Messenger have included the ability to access Yahoo! Chat rooms.   On June 19, 2005, with no advance warning, Yahoo! disabled users' ability to create their own chat rooms. The move came after  KPRC-TV  in  Houston, Texas  reported that many of the user-created rooms were geared toward  pedophilia . Many regulars in these rooms used the rooms to set up meetings to have sex with children and trade lewd pictures. While it was thought this move came as a result of several advertisers pulling their ads from Yahoo!, a more likely cause was a $10 million lawsuit filed by watchdog groups of internet portals on behalf of a 12-year-old victim of molestation [ 10 ]  .   Yahoo! has since closed down the chat.yahoo.com site (which is now a redirect to a section of the Yahoo! Messenger page) because the great majority of chat users accessed it through Messenger. In August 2007, it began requiring  word verification  in order to use Yahoo! Chat. Officially, this is to guard against spammers and automated bots, which had been a source of frustration for many chatters (This method has proved highly unsuccessful, as many rooms now have more bots than users). However, as this also logs users' IP addresses, this feature could presumably be used to monitor against the type of behavior that prevailed in the pedophilia-oriented rooms. The company claims to be still working on a way to allow users to create their own rooms while providing safeguards against abuse.   As of November 2008, Yahoo's inability to control chat bots and spammers continues to be a major issue. Over 90% of all chat messages, even in supposedly family oriented chat rooms like genealogy, appear to be originated by automated spam bots spewing solicitations for adult activities, web cams and pictures.   On October 16th, 2008, the Yahoo! Profiles community rolled out a new beta profile network with no prior announcement. According to customer feedback, the new profiles now resemble a stripped-down version of MASH.   This unexpected move resulted in hundreds of thousands of existing profiles being cleared of all information.     [ edit ]   Web Messenger   Similar to  MSN Web Messenger  and  AOL Instant Messenger 's  Aim Express and Quick Buddy , Yahoo! Messenger also has a web applet version that runs in a browser window to communicate with friends. Recently, it has switched from  DHTML  to  Adobe Flash  in coding.     [ edit ]   URI scheme   Yahoo! Messenger's installation process automatically installs an extra  URI scheme  (""protocol"") handler into some web browsers, so that URIs beginning "" ymsgr: "" can open a new Yahoo! Messenger window with specified parameters. This is similar in function to the  mailto:  URI scheme, which creates a new e-mail message using the system's default mail program. For instance, a web page might include a link like the following in its HTML source to open a window for sending a message to the YIM user  notarealuser :   <a href="" ymsgr:sendim?notarealuser "">Send Message</a>     To specify a message body, the  m  parameter is used, so that the link location might look like this:   ymsgr:sendim?notarealuser&m=This+is+my+message     * ymsgr:sendim? Example: ymsgr:sendim?myid      * ymsgr:addfriend? Example: ymsgr:addfriend?myid    * ymsgr:sendfile? Example: ymsgr:sendfile?myid    * ymsgr:call? Example: ymsgr:call?1-800-555-7654     * ymsgr:callPhone? Example: ymsgr:callPhone?1-800-555-7654    * YMSGR:chat? ""opens chat room list""    * ymsgr:im? Opens ""send an im window""    * ymsgr:getimv?doodle    * ymsgr:getimv?yfighter       [ edit ]   Offline messaging   Offline messaging, a feature long offered by  Yahoo! , allows online users to send messages to their contacts, even if said contacts are not signed in at the time. The sender's offline contacts will receive these messages when they next go online.     [ edit ]   Interoperability   On October 13, 2005, Yahoo! and Microsoft announced plans to introduce interoperability between their two messengers, creating the second largest real time communications service userbase worldwide: 40 percent of all users ( AIM  currently holds 56 percent). The announcement comes after years of 3rd party interoperability success (most notably,  Trillian ,  Pidgin ) and criticisms that the major real time communications services were locking their networks. Microsoft has also had talks with AOL in an attempt to introduce further interoperability, but so far, AOL seems unwilling to participate.   Interoperability between Yahoo! and Windows Live Messenger was launched July 12, 2006. This allows, for Yahoo! and Windows Live Messenger users to chat to each other without the need to create an account on the other service, provided both contacts use the latest versions of the clients. For now, it's impossible to talk using the voice service among both messengers.     [ edit ]   Games   There are various games and applications available that can be accessed via the conversation window by clicking the games icon and challenging your current contact. It requires  Java  to work.     [ edit ]   Main process   The Windows version of Yahoo! Messenger previously used ypager.exe as the name of the instance of the client. It was changed to yahoomessenger.exe since the  beta  of version 7.5.0.     [ edit ]   Malware   Yahoo! Messenger (along with other networks such as Windows Live Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger) is often used as a conduit or ""vector"" for delivering malicious software such as spyware, viruses, worms, and trojans to unsuspecting computer users. The three methods used by hackers to deliver malware over the IM vector are (1) sending a file transfer with a virus-infected file, (2) delivering a message with socially engineered content containing a web address (URL) containing active malicious code and (3) sending specially crafted messages exploiting security vulnerabilities in the client software. Viruses and worms with colorful names such as W32.Yalove or W32/Spybot-MQ have been identified as targeting users of the Yahoo! Messenger network over the past few years.   The most common method of delivering a malicious payload is the use of social engineering to construct a message that appears to be coming from a contact on the recipient's contact list. A socially engineered message is one that is written in a friendly, informal manner, that could easily be mistaken as coming from a friend. The message usually will say something like ""Click here to see pics of me from vacation!"" or ""Is this you?"" with a web address -- known as a ""poison URL"" -- for the recipient to click. Upon clicking the web address, the recipient is connected to a website containing active content, which is immediately downloaded to the recipient's computer. In most cases, the payload contains an installer, a number of hidden files containing text, and code which causes the same socially engineered message with poison URL to be sent to every contact on the contact list. When the message is sent to all contacts, the cycle starts again, as each contact believes they are receiving a message from a trusted friend. In this manner, IM-borne malware is capable of propagating very rapidly through company and external networks.   Worms and viruses are discovered on a regular basis by security companies, particularly by the three companies with  IM-specific security products , Akonix Systems, FaceTime Communications, and Symantec. According to IM security researchers at Akonix, the number of new threats identified each month is 30 to 35, with a high of 88 in October, 2006.     [ edit ]   SPIM   Yahoo! Messenger users are subject to unsolicited messages ( SPIM ) and the problem remains unresolved. Blogs and websites addressing this issue are supportive of the chat environment, and writers genuinely want to continue using the service, yet express frustration about Yahoo's apparent failure to address spam and other related problems. User queries are met with  forms  and replies that Yahoo is ""working to resolve the problem,"" yet there is no evident progress. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]  As of 2007 it is estimated that at least 60% of all users who use Yahoo chat rooms are bots. [ 13 ]  Yahoo has introduced a  CAPTCHA  system to help filter out bots from joining chat rooms but it has done little to actually stop the problem and has only inconvenienced human users.     [ edit ]   Canceled releases   Yahoo! recently released a preview version of Yahoo! Messenger: Yahoo! Messenger for Windows Vista. It has been designed to exploit the new design elements of Vista's  Windows Presentation Foundation  and entitles a whole new user interface and features. Currently it lacks some basic functions such as webcam support and Chat. It has been discontinued.     [ edit ]   Upcoming releases   The Mac OS X client version 3.0 Beta 3 has been released: file transfers have been re-enabled as have group conferences.

clueweb09-en0009-39-14672	      The Hacker's Diet   How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition    By  John Walker           The Hacker's Diet , notwithstanding its silly subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It treats dieting and weight control from an  engineering  and  management  standpoint, and provides the tools and an understanding of why they work and how to use them that permit the reader to gain control of their own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy, successful engineers, programmers, and managers who have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose weight and avoid re-gaining it.  Computer-based tools  and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing Platform are available, as well as an online Web application, but a computer is not necessary to use the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil alternatives are provided.     Fourth Edition (2005)       The Fourth Edition of  The Hacker's Diet  was released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance. The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the  XHTMLÂ 1.0  (Transitional and Frameset) and  CSSÂ 2.1  standards and requires a browser which implements these standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities. JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.       Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)     If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with frames remains available. It allows navigation with a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a footnote icon, like this one:   will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window. Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in the main document window by clicking the footnote icon, then use their browser's âBackâ button to return to the main text.     No-Frame Web Edition       Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those who prefer a more linear presentation in a single window, may access a no-frame edition of  The Hacker's Diet  with identical content to the frame-based book. The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click on the footnote icon to display it, then use the âBackâ button or keystroke to return to the text containing the footnote.       Computer-Based Tools     Computer-based tools and experiments for Microsoft Excel and the Palm Computing Platform are available for downloading. A Web-based application, The Hacker's Diet  Online , which can be used from any computer with Internet access and a Web browser, is available.       The Hacker's Diet  Online       This Web-based application allows you to maintain weight      and exercise logs, produce custom charts, analyse trends,  and plan diets from any computer with Internet connectivity and  a Web browser.  Data may be imported from and exported to  other versions of the computer tools, or exported as CSV or XML for  analysis with other programs.          Microsoft Excel       Versions compatible with         a variety of Excel releases are available, all ZIPped         archives of about 250 Kb.          Palm Computing Platform       An implementation of the Eat Watch Â®  nutrition and exercise         log and analysis software for the Palm Computing Platform         (PalmPilot, Palm, PalmOS, etc.), including desktop         software for any platform with a standard C language         environment which generates illustrated HTML logs         from databases backed up from the handheld.      Acrobat PDF Edition       If you prefer to read the book off-line, you can  download a PDF edition  (1.3 Mb, ZIP compressed) which you can read with the Adobe Acrobat Reader utility, available for most personal computers and Unix workstations, which may be  downloaded free of charge  directly from the  Adobe Systems  Web site. The Acrobat PDF edition preserves all the formatting of the original book, much of which was lost in creating the Web editions, and permits point-and-click navigation among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.      Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you a nice button for downloading your own copy of Acrobat Reader, but they won't let me use the image without âregisteringâ and âlicensingâ it, which I'm certainly not going to do in order to promote their product and its file format.       PostScript Edition      The Hacker's Diet  was originally typeset using  TeX  with the  LaTeX  macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated from PostScript created by the  dvips  utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line with a PostScript viewing program such as  GhostScript  (which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible printer.   Before sending this file to a printer, consider that the book is almost 250 pages long!   This is a  big  print job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and, potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be downloaded as either a  ZIPped archive  or a  gzip  compressed Unix  tar  file ; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7 Mb PostScript file.                           by  John Walker

VERY Cool Indeed   ~~ Linda F.          Johnson , Linda's Computer Stop          Do you get frustrated because every program has different keyboard    shortcuts and you can never remember them all?      Are there programs or websites that you use a lot and you would like    one button keyboard shortcuts that take you there instantly?      Are you using cardboard or plastic overlays on your keyboard that    show you which key does what in a particular program and those overlays    keep sliding all over the place?        Well, if your answer to ANY of these questions is ""yes"" have I found a   treat for YOU!!    Â     Canadians, here's one for you too!! Â  Excel Promotion Canada Webstore    About a month ago, a very nice man named Oren Kramer sent me an email and   asked if I would like to try out his Excel Keyboard.Â  Well, I had   actually been looking at my beatup keyboard with the faded keys and was   thinking it was time to replace it, so I figured ""why not?""Â  So, Oren   sent me this REALLY cool keyboard.Â  It is basically a plain black base   which has changeable keyboards that easily snap into place on top of it.Â    Oren sent me the base and the Excel snap-on, but there are many more for   different programs and games.Â  If you have the Flash viewer installed on your computer,   click below to see a little   movie that shows how they snap on:                         Besides Excel, there are keyboard snap-ons for programs like Word,   Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Flash, as well as keyboards for many popular   games like Age of Mythology and Neverwinter Nights, and even a Crossfire   keyboard that works with just about any action/shooting game.       See   my review of the Word Keyset HERE.     When you buy   the base, it comes with the Windows/Internet Explorer snap-on, so you can   use it as-is, or order snap-ons for the particular programs you use most.Â    I've found that I can use the Excel snap-on even when I'm not in Excel.Â    As a matter of fact, I'm using it to type this article right now.Â  When   using the snap-on within the program it was made for, every key on the   keyboard is clearly labelled to tell you what it does.Â  When Excel is   not the active window, the keyboard just works like a regular keyboard.     Along with all the   special keys built into the snap-ons that are linked to keyboard shortcuts   within that program, you can use the options to customize all the F keys   across the top of your keyboard, and there are pre-programmed multimedia   keys for easy access to Windows media player ... and 10 special keys on the   base keyboard that you can   program to open any file, folder, program, or web page of your choice.Â    I can turn on my computer and have Outlook, my website inside FrontPage,   media player playing my favorite music, and my internet home page opened in   about five seconds. And, I am so sick of having to replace my keyboard   every time one or two keys go bad.Â  Now, if that should happen, I won't   EVER have to replace my keyboard ... I can simply get a new snap-on, if   needed.Â  And the snap-on is so easy to clean...just remove it from the   base and shake all the dirt out of it. I love my new Excel Keyboard.Â  And, I'm patiently waiting for   my new Crossfire keyboard, which I purchased, since I can never remember which keys I have to   use to shoot, duck, jump, etc. when I'm playing action games, and therefore,   I always die  :-( Want more   info?Â  Go to theÂ  Ideazon Web Store    and see what they have to offer.

clueweb09-enwp01-33-18389	"                     Microsoft Natural keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Microsoft Natural Keyboard  is a  computer keyboard  that was introduced by  Microsoft  in 1994. The  keyboard  was a split keyboard with each half of the keyboard separated and tilted upwards and down from the center of the keyboard. This key arrangement was  ergonomically  designed to prevent  carpal tunnel syndrome  and other  repetitive strain injuries  associated with typing for long periods of time. The keyboard also helps to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer.   Although it was not the first ergonomic keyboard, it was the first that was widely available and reasonably priced. This keyboard has gained wide popularity.          Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, circa Q4 1999.       Microsoft introduced the  Natural Keyboard Elite  in 1998 and the  Natural Keyboard Pro  in 1999 as upgraded replacements for the original Natural Keyboard. The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the key block normally found above the cursor keys. Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys' inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below. It is said [ who? ]  that this change makes the arrow keys hard to use.   The Natural Keyboard Pro retained the original inverted-T layout of the cursor keys, and gained a row of program shortcut keys along the top edge of the board. These keys can be customized to the users preference by using the Intellitype software from Microsoft (Intellitype software is required to alter the operation of the shortcut keys, this keyboard has been dropped from the supported list in later versions and so cannot be used in Vista 64, however, selecting ""internet keyboard"" from the drop down list allows the functions to be edited as before and so allows full functionality in Vista 64).   Another significant change were the feet of the keyboard. While the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard has feet in the front, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back.   In 2004, Microsoft introduced the  Wireless Natural MultiMedia Keyboard , which introduced a row of customizable buttons above the function keys for launching applications or controlling play of music. A common criticism of this keyboard is the F Lock key located right beside F12, which toggles the functions keys from sending normal signals or common task signals such as Undo Redo, Open etc. The primary problem is that the default state of the F Lock is ""enabled"" meaning that the keyboard normally overrides the standard F-functions and instead attempts to perform the ""enhanced"" functions theoretically enabled by the software (which of course assumes, often incorrectly, that the user desires these enhanced functions and/or has installed the optional software.) It is not possible to disable this toggle either through the bundled software or by choosing not to install the software. Without the software installed, the F keys will do nothing, and toggling them back to normal by using the F Lock has been found by some to be unreliable as the keyboard will often randomly and inexplicably ""untoggle"" the F Lock key. See  here  for a method to disable the F-lock feature. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with ins keys removed and del key expanded.     [ edit ]   Natural Ergonomic Keyboard   In September 2005, Microsoft introduced the  Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 . This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, an integrated leatherette wrist rest and a ""hump"" in the middle of the keyboard that ensures that the wrist angle is correct. It also ships with a removable front stand that allows the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys without any bending of the wrist. Additionally, the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 23 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to ""on"", providing the original function key features rather than the new ""enhanced"" functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on. With this model, there is less of the distinctive ""click clack"" noise that is common with older keyboards that have mechanical switches. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Unlike its predecessor the Natural Pro, the 4000 does not include USB ports for additional devices such as a mouse.   With most Microsoft keyboards, software (Microsoft  IntelliType ) is bundled for both Mac OS X and Windows, allowing users to customize the function keys and modifier keys fairly extensively.   The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard claimed life of one million  actuations  for each QWERTY key. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^   ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Review"" .

clueweb09-enwp02-28-08555	"                     Microsoft Natural keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  Natural keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Microsoft Natural Keyboard  is a  computer keyboard  that was introduced by  Microsoft  in 1994. The  keyboard  was a split keyboard with each half of the keyboard separated and tilted upwards and down from the center of the keyboard. This key arrangement was  ergonomically  designed to prevent  carpal tunnel syndrome  and other  repetitive strain injuries  associated with typing for long periods of time. The keyboard also helps to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer.   Although it was not the first ergonomic keyboard, it was the first that was widely available and reasonably priced. This keyboard has gained wide popularity.          Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro, circa Q4 1999.       Microsoft introduced the  Natural Keyboard Elite  in 1998 and the  Natural Keyboard Pro  in 1999 as upgraded replacements for the original Natural Keyboard. The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the key block normally found above the cursor keys. Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys' inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below. It is said [ who? ]  that this change makes the arrow keys hard to use.   The Natural Keyboard Pro retained the original inverted-T layout of the cursor keys, and gained a row of program shortcut keys along the top edge of the board. These keys can be customized to the users preference by using the Intellitype software from Microsoft (Intellitype software is required to alter the operation of the shortcut keys, this keyboard has been dropped from the supported list in later versions and so cannot be used in Vista 64, however, selecting ""internet keyboard"" from the drop down list allows the functions to be edited as before and so allows full functionality in Vista 64).   Another significant change were the feet of the keyboard. While the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard has feet in the front, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back.   In 2004, Microsoft introduced the  Wireless Natural MultiMedia Keyboard , which introduced a row of customizable buttons above the function keys for launching applications or controlling play of music. A common criticism of this keyboard is the F Lock key located right beside F12, which toggles the functions keys from sending normal signals or common task signals such as Undo Redo, Open etc. The primary problem is that the default state of the F Lock is ""enabled"" meaning that the keyboard normally overrides the standard F-functions and instead attempts to perform the ""enhanced"" functions theoretically enabled by the software (which of course assumes, often incorrectly, that the user desires these enhanced functions and/or has installed the optional software.) It is not possible to disable this toggle either through the bundled software or by choosing not to install the software. Without the software installed, the F keys will do nothing, and toggling them back to normal by using the F Lock has been found by some to be unreliable as the keyboard will often randomly and inexplicably ""untoggle"" the F Lock key. See  here  for a method to disable the F-lock feature. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the Home/End/Del/Ins/Page up/down set has been changed to 3x2 vertical layout, with ins keys removed and del key expanded.     [ edit ]   Natural Ergonomic Keyboard   In September 2005, Microsoft introduced the  Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 . This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, an integrated leatherette wrist rest and a ""hump"" in the middle of the keyboard that ensures that the wrist angle is correct. It also ships with a removable front stand that allows the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys without any bending of the wrist. Additionally, the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 23 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to ""on"", providing the original function key features rather than the new ""enhanced"" functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on. With this model, there is less of the distinctive ""click clack"" noise that is common with older keyboards that have mechanical switches. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] . Unlike its predecessor the Natural Pro, the 4000 does not include USB ports for additional devices such as a mouse.   With most Microsoft keyboards, software (Microsoft  IntelliType ) is bundled for both Mac OS X and Windows, allowing users to customize the function keys and modifier keys fairly extensively.   The Natural Ergonomic Keyboard claimed life of one million  actuations  for each QWERTY key. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^   ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Review"" .

[ edit ]   Features   The player has a choice of six tile layouts - Cat, Turtle, Crab, Dragon, Fortress and Spider, each a stylised portrayal of the respective object or animal. The background image can be chosen from five different options and there are four tile sets, including traditional  Mahjong tiles , variations with fuller colouring or larger print, and an alternative pastel tile set with an entirely different picture theme.

The game board is able to be rotated in  3D , and theme choices are available for the chess pieces and board.     [ edit ]   Gameplay   The game can be played with either a  mouse  or any  gamepad  like a  PlayStation 3  or a  Xbox 360  controller for  Windows . It can also be played through Windows Media Center, using the remote control provided with TV Tuner Cards, and certain laptops as well.     [ edit ]   Player vs. computer   Players can play against the computer after selecting the computer skill in a scale from 1 to 10. After a move is made by the computer, the player can view the last move. When clicking on a chess piece, Chess Titans selects all possibilities for that move, which helps the player in playing Chess. This option can also be turned off.     [ edit ]   Player vs. player   In a two-player game, the chess board automatically turns 180 degrees, after a player has made its move. Chess Titans saves all scores of two-player games.                 v Â   Â  d Â   Â  e     Windows components             Core     Aero Â     AutoRun Â     ClearType Â     Desktop Window Manager Â

clueweb09-enwp00-53-24543	"                     Digital rights management          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia      Â Â (Redirected from  Digital Rights Management )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Digital rights management  ( DRM ) is a generic term that refers to  access control  technologies used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, and  copyright  holders to limit usage of digital media or devices. The term is used to describe any technology which makes the unauthorized use of media or devices technically formidable and generally doesn't include other forms of  copy protection  which can be circumvented without modifying the media or device, such as  serial numbers  or  keyfiles . It can also refer to restrictions associated with specific instances of digital works or devices.   Digital rights management has been and is being used by companies such as  Sony ,  Apple Inc. ,  Microsoft  and the  BBC .   The use of digital rights management is controversial. Advocates argue it is necessary for copyright holders to prevent unauthorized duplication of their work to ensure continued revenue streams. [ 1 ]  Some opponents, such as the  Free Software Foundation , maintain that the use of the word ""rights"" is misleading and suggest that people instead use the term  Digital Restrictions Management . Their position is essentially that copyright holders are attempting to restrict use of copyrighted material in ways not covered by existing laws. [ 2 ]  The  Electronic Frontier Foundation , and other opponents, also consider DRM systems to be  anti-competitive practices . [ 3 ]   In practice, all widely-used DRM systems have been defeated or circumvented when deployed to enough customers. [ 4 ]  Restricting the copying of audio and visual material is especially difficult due to the existence of the  analog hole , and there are even suggestions that effective DRM is logically impossible for this reason.           Contents       1   Introduction   2   Technologies     2.1   DRM and film   2.2   DRM and music     2.2.1   Audio CDs   2.2.2   Internet music       2.3   Computer games   2.4   E-books   2.5   DRM and documents   2.6   Watermarks   2.7   Metadata       3   Table of DRM technologies and associated devices   4   Laws regarding DRM     4.1   Digital Millennium Copyright Act   4.2   International issues       5   Controversy     5.1   DRM opposition   5.2   ""DRM-Free""       6   Shortcomings     6.1   Methods to bypass DRM   6.2   Analog hole   6.3   DRM on general computing platforms   6.4   DRM on distributed purpose built hardware   6.5   Watermarks   6.6   Mass piracy failure   6.7   Obsolescence       7   Historical note   8   See also     8.1   Related concepts   8.2   Lobbying organizations       9   References   10   Further reading   11   External links               [ edit ]   Introduction   Digital rights management technologies attempt to control use of digital media by preventing access, copying or conversion to other formats by  end users . Long before the arrival of digital or even electronic media, copyright holders, content producers, or other financially or artistically interested parties had business and legal objections to copying technologies. Examples include:  player piano  rolls early in the 20th century,  audio tape recording , and  video tape recording  (e.g. the "" Betamax case "" in the  U.S. ). Copying technology thus exemplifies a  disruptive technology .   The advent of digital media and analog/digital conversion technologies, especially those that are usable on mass-market general-purpose personal computers, have vastly increased the concerns of copyright-dependent organizations, especially within the music and movie industries. While  analog  media inevitably loses quality with each  copy generation , and in some cases even during normal use, digital media files may be duplicated an unlimited number of times with no degradation in the quality of subsequent copies. The advent of  personal computers  as household appliances has made it convenient for consumers to convert media (which may or may not be copyrighted) originally in a physical/analog form or a broadcast form into a universal, digital form (this process is called  ripping ) for location- or  timeshifting , combined with the  Internet  and popular  file sharing  tools, has made unauthorized distribution of copies of copyrighted digital media (so-called  digital piracy ) much easier. In effect, copyright-dependent organizations regard every consumer with an Internet connection as a potential node of a distribution network that could be used to distribute unauthorized copies of copyrighted works.   Although technical controls on the reproduction and use of software have been intermittently used since the 1970s, the term 'DRM' has come to primarily mean the use of these measures to control artistic or literary content. [ citation needed ]  DRM technologies have enabled publishers to enforce access policies that not only disallow  copyright infringements , but also prevent lawful  fair use  of copyrighted works, or even implement use constraints on non-copyrighted works that they distribute; examples include the placement of DRM on certain  public-domain  or  open-licensed  e-books, or DRM included in consumer electronic devices that time-shift (and apply DRM to) both copyrighted and non-copyrighted works.   While DRM is most commonly used by the  entertainment industry  ( e.g.   film  and  recording ), it has found use in other situations as well. Many  online music stores , such as  Apple 's  iTunes Store , as well as certain  e-book  publishers, have imposed DRM on their customers. In recent years, a number of  television producers  have imposed DRM mandates on consumer electronic devices, to control access to the freely-broadcast content of their shows, in connection with the popularity of time-shifting  digital video recorder  systems such as  TiVo . [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Technologies     [ edit ]   DRM and film   An early example of a DRM system was the  Content Scrambling System  (CSS) employed by the  DVD Forum  on film  DVDs  since  ca.  1996. CSS used a simple  encryption algorithm , and required device manufacturers to sign  license agreements  that restricted the inclusion of features, such as digital outputs that could be used to extract high-quality digital copies of the film, in their players. Thus, the only consumer hardware capable of decoding DVD films was controlled, albeit indirectly, by the DVD Forum, restricting the use of DVD media on other systems until the release of  DeCSS  by  Jon Lech Johansen  in 1999, which allowed a CSS-encrypted DVD to play properly on a computer using  Linux , for which the Alliance had not arranged a licensed version of the CSS playing  software .   Microsoft 's  Windows Vista  contains a DRM system called the  Protected Media Path , which contains the Protected Video Path (PVP). PVP tries to stop DRM-restricted content from playing while unsigned software is running in order to prevent the unsigned software from accessing the content. Additionally, PVP can encrypt information during transmission to the monitor or the graphics card, which makes it more difficult to make unauthorized recordings.   Advanced Access Content System  (AACS) is a DRM system for  HD DVD  and  Blu-Ray Discs  developed by the AACS Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA), a  consortium  that includes  Disney ,  Intel ,  Microsoft ,  Matsushita  (Panasonic),  Warner Brothers ,  IBM ,  Toshiba  and  Sony . In December 2006 a process key was published on the internet by  hackers , enabling unrestricted access to AACS-restricted HD DVD content. [ 6 ]  After the cracked keys were revoked, further cracked keys were released. [ 7 ]   The  broadcast flag  concept was developed by Fox Broadcasting in 2001 and was supported by the  MPAA  and the  FCC . A ruling in May 2005 by a US Court of Appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether or not a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as  time-shifting . [ citation needed ]  It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the Digital Video Broadcasting Project (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufactures, network operators, software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.   An updated variant of the broadcast flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management ( DVB-CPCM ). It was developed in private, and the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, at the direction of the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the  EFF , which paid to be a member of the consortium, ""You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices"". [ 8 ]  The DVB supports the system as it will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies and so make things easier for end users. The CPCM system is expected to be submitted to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute in 2008.     [ edit ]   DRM and music     [ edit ]   Audio CDs   Discs with digital rights management schemes are not legitimately standards-compliant  Compact Discs  (CDs) but are rather CD-ROM media. Therefore they all lack the CD logotype found on discs which follow the standard (known as  Red Book ). Therefore these CDs could not be played on all  CD players . Many consumers could also no longer play purchased CDs on their computers.  PCs  running  Microsoft Windows  would sometimes even crash when attempting to play the CDs. [ 9 ]   In 2002,  Bertelsmann  (comprising  BMG ,  Arista , and  RCA ) was the first corporation to use DRM on audio CDs. [ citation needed ]  In 2005,  Sony BMG introduced new DRM technology  which installed DRM software on users' computers without clearly notifying the user or requiring confirmation. Among other things, the installed software included a  rootkit , which created a severe security vulnerability others could exploit. When the nature of the DRM involved was made public much later, Sony initially minimized the significance of the vulnerabilities its software had created, but was eventually compelled to recall millions of CDs, and released several attempts to patch the surreptitiously included software to at least remove the rootkit. Several  class action lawsuits  were filed, which were ultimately settled by agreements to provide affected consumers with a cash payout or album downloads free of DRM. [ 10 ]   Sony's DRM software actually had only a limited ability to prevent copying, as it affected only playback on Windows computers, not on other equipment. Even on the Windows platform, users regularly bypassed the restrictions. And, while the Sony DRM technology created fundamental vulnerabilities in customers' computers, parts of it could be trivially bypassed by holding down the ""shift"" key while inserting the CD, or by disabling the  autorun  feature. In addition, audio tracks could simply be played and re-recorded, thus completely bypassing all of the DRM (this is known as the  analog hole ). Sony's first two attempts at releasing a  patch  which would remove the DRM software from users' computers failed.   In January 2007,  EMI  stopped publishing audio CDs with DRM, stating that ""the costs of DRM do not measure up to the results."" EMI was the last publisher to do so, and audio CDs containing DRM are no longer released by any major record labels. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Internet music   Many online music stores employ DRM to restrict usage of music purchased and downloaded online. There are many options for consumers buying digital music over the internet, in terms of both stores and purchase options.     The  iTunes Store , run by Apple Inc., allows users to purchase a track online for $.99 US. The tracks purchased use Apple's  FairPlay  DRM system. Apple later launched  iTunes Plus , which offered higher quality DRM-free tracks for a higher price. On October 17, 2007, iTunes Plus became available at the usual $.99 price, replacing the non-Plus tracks. [ 12 ]  As of January 6, 2009 Apple had announced at their keynote that iTunes will be completely DRM free by the end of the month.       Napster music store , which offers a subscription-based approach to DRM alongside permanent purchases. Users of the subscription service can download and stream an unlimited amount of music transcoded to  Windows Media Audio (WMA)  while subscribed to the service. But when the subscription period lapses, all of the downloaded music is unplayable until the user renews his or her subscription. Napster also charges users who wish to use the music on their portable device an additional $5 per month. In addition, Napster gives users the option of paying an additional $0.99 per track to burn it to CD or for the song to never expire. Music bought through Napster can be played on players carrying the  Microsoft PlaysForSure  logo (which, notably, do not include  iPods  or even Microsoft's own  Zune ). Now Napster is giving DRM free MP3 music.       Wal-Mart Music Downloads, another online music download store, charges $0.94 per track for all non-sale downloads. All Wal-Mart, Music Downloads are able to be played on any Windows PlaysForSure marked product. The music does play on the  SanDisk 's  Sansa   mp3 player , for example, but must be copied to the player's  internal memory . It cannot be played through the player's  microSD  card slot, which is a problem that many users of the mp3 player experience.       Sony  operated an online music download service called "" Connect "" which used Sony's proprietary  OpenMG  DRM technology. Music downloaded from this store (usually via Sony's  SonicStage  software) was only playable on computers running  Windows  and Sony hardware (including the  PSP ).     The various services are currently not interoperable, though those that use the same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need  plug-ins . Several colleges and  universities , such as  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute , have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. [ 13 ]  One of the problems is that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The  Gowers Review of Intellectual Property  (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8 -- 12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some of the acrimony may decrease.   Although DRM is prevalent for Internet music, some  Online music stores  such as  eMusic ,  Dogmazic ,  Amazon , and  Beatport , do not use DRM despite encouraging users to avoid sharing music. Another online retailer, Xiie.net, which sells only unsigned artists, encourages people to share the music they buy from the site, to increase exposure for the artists themselves. Major labels have begun releasing more online music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that this is because the record labels are ""slowly beginning to realize that they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store."" [ 14 ]  Apple's  Steve Jobs  has called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled  Thoughts on Music . [ 15 ]  Apple's iTunes store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s)  AAC  encoded music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price). In March 2007, Musicload.de, one of Europe's largest online music retailers, announced their position strongly against DRM. In an open letter, Musicload stated that three out of every four calls to their customer support phone service are as a result of consumer frustration with DRM. [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Computer games   Computer games sometimes use DRM technologies to limit the number of systems the game can be installed on. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs. This limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (Seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them to limit the number of installations). These technologies tend to benefit publishers from blocking sales in the second hand market more than stopping piracy. In 2008 the DRM scheme backfired and a large number of users decided not to pay for the game, seeking a pirated version instead. The most prominent cases involved the DRM topology  SecuROM  include  Spore ,  BioShock  and  Mass Effect . The backlash against SecuROM was a significant factor in  Spore  becoming the most pirated game in 2008. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   E-books   Electronic books  read on a  personal computer  or an  e-book reader  typically use DRM restrictions to limit copying, printing, and sharing of e-books. E-books are usually limited to a certain number of reading devices and some e-publishers prevent any copying or printing. Some commentators believe that DRM is a reason why the E-book has been a marketing failure. [ 19 ]   Two of the most commonly used software programs to view e-books are  Adobe Acrobat  and  Microsoft Reader . [ 20 ]  Each program uses a slightly different approach to content protection. The first version of Adobe Acrobat e-book Reader to have encryption technologies was version 5.05. In the later version 6.0, the technologies of the PDF reader and the e-book reader were combined, allowing it to read both DRM-restricted and unrestricted files. [ 21 ]  After opening the file, the user is able to view the rights statement, which outlines actions available for the specific document. For example, for a freely transferred  PDF , printing, copying to the clipboard, and other basic functions are available to the user. However, when viewing a more highly restricted  e-book , the user is unable to print the book, copy or paste selections. [ 21 ]  The level of restriction is specified by the publisher or distribution agency. [ 22 ]   Microsoft Reader , which exclusively reads e-books in a .lit format, contains its own DRM software. In Microsoft Reader there are three different levels of access control depending on the e-book: sealed e-books, inscribed e-books and owner exclusive e-books. Sealed e-books have the least amount of restriction and only prevents the document from being modified. [ 23 ]  Therefore, the reader cannot alter the content of the book to change the ending, for instance. Inscribed e-books are the next level of restriction. After purchasing and downloading the e-book, Microsoft Reader puts a digital ID tag to identify the owner of the e-book. Therefore, this discourages distribution of the e-book because it is inscribed with the owners name making it possible to trace it back to the original copy that was distributed. [ 24 ]  Other e-book software uses similar DRM schemes. For example, Palm Digital Media, now known as  Ereader , links the credit card information of the purchaser to the e-book copy in order to discourage distribution of the books. [ 25 ]   The most stringent form of security that Microsoft Reader offers is called owner exclusive e-books, which uses traditional DRM technologies. To buy the e-book the consumer must first open Microsoft Reader, which ensures that when the book is downloaded it becomes linked to the computers  Microsoft Passport  account. Thus the e-book can only be opened with the computer with which it was downloaded, preventing copying and distribution of the text. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   DRM and documents   Enterprise digital rights management  ( E-DRM  or  ERM ) is the application of DRM technology to the control of access to corporate documents such as  Microsoft Word ,  PDF , and  AutoCAD  files, emails, and  intranet  web pages rather than to the control of consumer media. [ 27 ]  E-DRM, now more commonly referenced as IRM ( Information Rights Management ), is generally intended to prevent the unauthorized use (such as  industrial or corporate espionage  or inadvertent release) of proprietary documents. IRM typically integrates with  content management  system software.   DRM has been used by organizations such as the  British Library  in its  secure electronic delivery service  to permit worldwide access to substantial numbers of rare (and in many cases unique) documents which, for legal reasons, were previously only available to authorized individuals actually visiting the Library's document centre at Boston Spa in England. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Watermarks   Digital watermarks  are unobtrusive features of media that are added during production or distribution. Digital watermarks involve data that is arguably  steganographically  embedded within the audio or video data.   Watermarks can be used for different purposes that may include:     for recording the copyright owner   for recording the distributor   for recording the distribution chain   for identifying the purchaser of the music     Watermarks are not complete DRM mechanisms in their own right, but are used as part of a system for Digital Rights Management, such as helping provide prosecution evidence for purely legal avenues of rights management, rather than direct technological restriction. Some programs used to edit video and/or audio may distort, delete, or otherwise interfere with watermarks. Signal/modulator-carrier chromatography may also separate watermarks from original audio or detect them as glitches. Use of third party media players and other advanced programs render watermarking useless. Additionally, comparison of two separately obtained copies of audio using simple, home-grown algorithms can often reveal watermarks. New methods of detection are currently under investigation by both industry and non-industry researchers.     [ edit ]   Metadata   Sometimes,  metadata  is included in purchased music which records information such as the purchaser's name, account information, or email address. This information is not embedded in the played audio or video data, like a watermark, but is kept separate, but within the file or stream.   As an example, metadata is used in media purchased from Apple's iTunes Store for DRM-free as well as DRM-restricted versions of their music or videos. This information is included as MPEG standard metadata.

[ edit ]   Laws regarding DRM   Digital rights management systems have received some international legal backing by implementation of the 1996  WIPO Copyright Treaty  (WCT). Article 11 of the Treaty requires nations party to the treaties to enact laws against DRM circumvention.   The WCT has been implemented in most member states of the  World Intellectual Property Organization . The American implementation is the  Digital Millennium Copyright Act  (DMCA), while in Europe the treaty has been implemented by the 2001  European directive on copyright , which requires member states of the  European Union  to implement legal protections for technological prevention measures. In 2006 [update] , the lower house of the French parliament adopted such legislation as part of the controversial  DADVSI  law, but added that protected DRM techniques should be made interoperable, a move which caused widespread controversy in the United States.     [ edit ]   Digital Millennium Copyright Act       Main article:  Digital Millennium Copyright Act       The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is an extension to  United States   copyright law  passed unanimously on  May 14 ,  1998 , which criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology that allows users to circumvent technical copy-restriction methods. Under the Act, circumvention of a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work is illegal if done with the primary intent of violating the rights of copyright holders. (For a more detailed analysis of the statute, see  WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act .)   Reverse engineering of existing systems is expressly permitted under the Act under specific conditions. Under the reverse engineering safe harbor, circumvention necessary to achieve interoperability with other software is specifically authorized. See 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(f). Open-source software to decrypt content scrambled with the Content Scrambling System and other encryption techniques presents an intractable problem with the application of the Act. Much depends on the intent of the actor. If the decryption is done for the purpose of achieving interoperability of open source operating systems with proprietary operating systems, the circumvention would be protected by Section 1201(f) the Act. Cf., Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d Cir. 2001) at notes 5 and 16. However, dissemination of such software for the purpose of violating or encouraging others to violate copyrights has been held illegal. See Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F. Supp. 2d 346 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).   On  22 May   2001 , the European Union passed the  EU Copyright Directive , an implementation of the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty that addressed many of the same issues as the DMCA.   The DMCA has been largely ineffective in protecting DRM systems, [ citation needed ]  as software allowing users to circumvent DRM remains widely available, as for instance over the  Internet . However, those with an interest in preserving the DRM systems have attempted to use the Act to restrict the distribution and development of such software, as in the case of DeCSS.   Although the Act contains an exception for research, the exception is subject to vague qualifiers that do little to reassure the research community. Cf., 17 U.S.C. Sec. 1201(g). The DMCA has had an impact on the worldwide  cryptography  research community, because many fear that their cryptanalytic research violates, or might be construed to violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer  Dmitry Sklyarov  in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after a presentation at  DEF CON , and subsequently spent several months in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to non-criminal inclined users, such as students of  cryptanalysis  (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Felten and students at  Princeton [ 32 ] ), and security consultants such as the Netherlands based  Niels Ferguson , who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an  Intel  secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the US.   On  25 April   2007  the European Parliament supported the first directive of EU, which aims to harmonize criminal law in the member states. It adopted a first reading report on harmonizing the national measures for fighting copyright abuse. If the European Parliament and the Council approve the legislation, the submitted directive will oblige the member states to consider a crime a violation of international copyright committed with commercial purposes. The text suggests numerous measures: from fines to imprisonment, depending on the gravity of the offense.   The EP members supported the Commission motion, changing some of the texts. They excluded patent rights from the range of the directive and decided that the sanctions should apply only to offenses with commercial purposes. Copying for personal, non-commercial purposes was also excluded from the range of the directive.

It is an open and neutral platform for exchange of facts and opinions, mainly based on articles by authors from science and practice.   The  AXMEDIS  project is a European Commission Integrated Project of the FP6. The main goal of AXMEDIS is automating the content production, copy-prevention and distribution, reducing the related costs and supporting DRM at both B2B and B2C areas harmonising them.   The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property is the result of a commission by the British Government from  Andrew Gowers , undertaken in December 2005 and published in 2006, with recommendations regarding copyright term, exceptions, orphaned works, and copyright enforcement.     The  European Community  was expected to produce a recommendation on DRM in 2006, phasing out the use of  levies  (compensation to rights holders charged on media sales for lost revenue due to unauthorized copying) given the advances in DRM/TPM technology. However, opposition from the member states, particularly France, have now made it unlikely that the recommendation will be adopted. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Controversy     [ edit ]   DRM opposition          A parody on the  Home Taping Is Killing Music  logo.       Many organizations, prominent individuals, and computer scientists are opposed to DRM. Two notable DRM critics are  John Walker , as expressed for instance, in his article  The Digital Imprimatur : How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle [ 33 ] , and  Richard Stallman  in his article  The Right to Read [ 34 ]  and in other public statements: "" DRM is an example of a malicious feature - a feature designed to hurt the user of the software, and therefore, it's something for which there can never be toleration "". [ 35 ]  Professor  Ross Anderson  of Cambridge University heads a British organization which opposes DRM and similar efforts in the UK and elsewhere.  Cory Doctorow , a prominent writer and technology blogger, spoke on the  Microsoft  campus criticizing the technology, the morality, and the marketing of DRM. [ 4 ]   There have been numerous others who see DRM at a more fundamental level.  TechMediums.com  argues that DRM-free music allows for viral marketing, arguing that independent artists benefit from ""free marketing"" and can then focus on revenues from higher margin products like merchandise and concert ticket sales. This is similar to some of the ideas in Michael H. Goldhaber's presentation about ""The Attention Economy and the Net"" at a 1997 conference on the ""Economics of Digital Information."" [ 36 ]  (sample quote from the ""Advice for the Transition"" section of that presentation: [ 36 ]  ""If you can't figure out how to afford it without charging, you may be doing something wrong."")   The  Electronic Frontier Foundation  and similar organizations such as  FreeCulture.org  also hold positions which are characterized as opposed to DRM.   The  Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure  has criticized DRM's impact as a  trade barrier  from a  free market  perspective.   The final version of the  GNU General Public License  version 3, as released by the  Free Software Foundation , prohibits using DRM to restrict free redistribution and modification of works covered by the license, and includes a clause stating that the license's provisions shall be interpreted as disfavoring use of DRM. Also, in May 2006, the FSF launched a "" Defective by Design "" campaign against DRM.   Creative Commons  provides licensing options encouraging the expansion of and building upon creative work without the use of DRM. [ 37 ]  In addition, the use of a Creative Commons-licensed work on a device which incorporates DRM is a breach of the Baseline Rights asserted by each license. [ 38 ]   Bill Gates spoke about DRM at CES in 2006. According to him, DRM is not where it should be, and causes problems for legitimate consumers while trying to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate users. [ 39 ]   According to  Steve Jobs ,  Apple  opposes DRM music after a public letter calling its music labels to stop requiring DRM on its  iTunes Store . To date,  EMI  has complied. [ 40 ]  Apple considers DRM on video content as a separate issue.           Defective by Design  member protesting DRM on  May 25 ,  2007 .       As already noted, many DRM opponents consider ""digital rights management"" to be a misnomer. They argue that DRM manages rights (or access) the same way prison manages freedom and often refer to it as ""digital restrictions management"". Alternatively, ZDNet Executive Editor David Berlind suggests the term ""Content Restriction, Annulment and Protection"" or ""CRAP"" for short. [ 41 ]   The Norwegian Consumer rights organization ""Forbrukerrdet"" complained to Apple Inc. in 2007 about the company's use of DRM in, and in conjunction with, its iPod and iTunes products. Apple was accused of restricting users' access to their music and videos in an unlawful way, and to use  EULAs  conflicting with Norwegian consumer legislation. The complaint was supported by consumers'  ombudsmen  in Sweden and Denmark, and is currently being reviewed in the EU. Similarly, the United States  Federal Trade Commission  is planning to hold hearings in March of  2009  to review disclosure of DRM limitations to customers of media products [ 42 ] .   The use of DRM may also be a barrier to future historians, since technologies designed to permit data to be read only on particular machines, or with particular keys, or for certain periods, may well make future data recovery impossible  see  Digital Revolution . This argument connects the issue of DRM with that of asset management and archive technology. [ citation needed ]   DRM opponents argue that the presence of DRM violates existing  private property  rights and restricts a range of heretofore normal and legal user activities. A DRM component would control a device a user owns (such as a  Digital audio player ) by restricting how it may act with regards to certain content, overriding some of the user's wishes (for example, preventing the user from burning a copyrighted song to  CD  as part of a compilation or a review). An example of this effect may be seen in  Microsoft 's  Windows Vista  operating system in which content is disabled or degraded depending on the DRM scheme's evaluation of whether the hardware and its use are 'secure'. All forms of DRM depend on the DRM enabled device (e.g., computer, DVD player, TV) imposing restrictions that (at least by intent) cannot be disabled or modified by the user. [ citation needed ]   Tools like  FairUse4WM  have been created to strip Windows Media of DRM restrictions. [ 43 ]   Valve  President  Gabe Newell  also stated ""most DRM strategies are just dumb"" because they only decrease the value of a game in the consumer's eyes. Newell's suggests pairing DRM with ""[creating] greater value for customers through service value"", and stopped short of repudiating Valve's DRM system, known as  Steam .  [ 44 ]     [ edit ]   ""DRM-Free""   Due to the strong opposition that exists to DRM, many companies and artists have begun advertising their products as ""DRM-Free"". [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ]   Most notably, Apple began selling ""DRM-Free"" music through their iTunes store in April of 2007. [ 48 ]  It was later revealed that the DRM-Free iTunes files were still embedded with each user's account information, a form of copy protection generally not regarded as DRM. In January of 2009, iTunes began marketing all of their songs as ""DRM-Free [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Shortcomings     [ edit ]   Methods to bypass DRM   There are many methods to bypass DRM control on audio and video content.   One simple method to bypass DRM on audio files is to burn the content to an audio CD and then  rip  it into DRM-free files. This is only possible when the software that plays these DRM-restricted audio files allows CD-burning. Some software products simplify and automate this burn-rip process by allowing the user to burn music to a CD-RW disc or to a Virtual CD-R drive, then automatically ripping and encoding the music, and automatically repeating this process until all selected music has been converted, rather than forcing the user to do this one CD (72-80 minutes worth of music) at a time.   Many software programs have been developed that intercept the data stream as it is decrypted out of the DRM-restricted file, and then use this data to construct a DRM-free file. These programs require a decryption key. Programs that do this for DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs include universal decryption keys in the software itself. Programs that do this for TiVo ToGo recordings, iTunes audio, and PlaysForSure songs, however, rely on the user's own key  that is, they can only process content that the user has legally acquired under his or her own account.   Another method is to use software to record the signals being sent through the audio or video cards, or to plug analog recording devices into the analog outputs of the media player. These techniques utilize the so-called "" analog hole "" (see below).     [ edit ]   Analog hole       Main article:  Analog hole       All forms of DRM for audio and visual material (excluding interactive materials, like videogames) are subject to the  analog hole , namely that in order for a viewer to play the material, the digital signal must be turned into an analog signal containing light and/or sound for the viewer, and so available to be copied as no DRM is capable of controlling content in this form. In other words, a user could play a purchased audio file while using a separate program to record the sound back into the computer into a DRM-free file format.   All DRM to date, and probably all future ones can therefore be bypassed by recording this signal and digitally storing and distributing it in a non DRM limited form, by anyone who has the technical means of recording the analog stream. However the conversion from digital to analog and back is likely to force a loss of quality, particularly when using  lossy  digital formats.  HDCP  is an attempt to restrict the analog hole, although it is largely ineffective. [ citation needed ]   Asus  released a soundcard which features a function called ""Analog Loopback Transformation"" to bypass the restrictions of DRM. This feature allows the user to record DRM-restricted audio via the soundcard's built-in analog I/O connection. [ 50 ] [ 51 ]     [ edit ]   DRM on general computing platforms   Many of the DRM systems in use are designed to work on general purpose computing hardware, such as desktop PCs apparently because this equipment is felt to be a major contributor to revenue loss from disallowed copying. Large commercial copyright infringers (""pirates"") avoid consumer equipment, so losses from such infringers will not be covered by such provisions.   Some  [ 4 ]  have suggested that any such scheme can never be secure since the software must include all the information, such as  decryption keys , necessary to decrypt the content. It is suggested that one can always extract this information and decrypt and copy the content, bypassing the restrictions imposed by a DRM system.     [ edit ]   DRM on distributed purpose built hardware   Many DRM schemes use encrypted media which requires purpose built hardware to hear or see the content. This appears to ensure that only licensed users (those with the hardware) can access the content. It additionally tries to protect a secret decryption key from the users of the system.   While this in principle can work, it is extremely difficult to build the hardware to protect the secret key against a sufficiently determined adversary. Many such systems have failed in the field. Once the secret key is known, building a version of the hardware that performs no checks is often relatively straightforward. In addition user verification provisions are frequently subject to attack.   A common real-world example can be found in commercial  direct broadcast satellite  television systems such as  DirecTV . The company uses tamper-resistant  smart cards  to store decryption keys so that they are hidden from the user and the satellite receiver. However, the system has been compromised in the past, and DirecTV has been forced to roll out periodic updates and replacements for its smart cards.     [ edit ]   Watermarks   Watermarks are usually easily removed, although some degradation of video or audio can occur.   In particular, most compression is intended to only retain perceptible features of an image, and hence if the watermarks are invisible, then they are very typically removed by compression systems as a side-effect.     [ edit ]   Mass piracy failure   Mass piracy of hard copies (not Internet distribution) does not need a DRM decryption/removal as it can be achieved by bit-perfect copying a legally obtained medium without accessing the decrypted content. Other copy protection methods such as specific data layout on the medium perform better in this area. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Obsolescence   When standards and formats change, it may be difficult to transfer DRM-restricted content to new media. Additionally, any system that requires contact with an authentication server is vulnerable to that server becoming unavailable, as happened [ 52 ]  in 2007 when videos purchased from  Major League Baseball  (mlb.com) prior to 2006 became unplayable due to a change to the servers that validate the licences.   Microsoft Zune  - When Microsoft introduced their  Zune [ 53 ]  media player in 2006, it did not support content that uses Microsoft's own  PlaysForSure  DRM scheme they had previously been selling. The  EFF  calls this ""a raw deal"". [ 54 ]   MSN Music  - In April 2008, Microsoft sent an email to former customers of the now-defunct MSN Music store: ""As of August 31, 2008, we will no longer be able to support the retrieval of license keys for the songs you purchased from MSN Music or the authorization of additional computers. You will need to obtain a license key for each of your songs downloaded from MSN Music on any new computer, and you must do so before August 31, 2008. If you attempt to transfer your songs to additional computers after August 31, 2008, those songs will not successfully play."" [ 55 ]   However, to avoid a public relations disaster, Microsoft re-issued MSN Music shutdown statement on June 19 th  and allowed the users to use their licenses till the end of 2011: ""After careful consideration, Microsoft has decided to continue to support the authorization of new computers and devices and delivery of new license keys for MSN Music customers through at least the end of 2011, after which we will evaluate how much this functionality is still being used and what steps should be taken next to support our customers. This means you will continue to be able to listen to your purchased music and transfer your music to new PCs and devices beyond the previously announced August 31, 2008 date."" [ 56 ]   Yahoo! Music Store  - On  July 23 , 2008, the Yahoo! Music Store emailed its customers to tell them it will be shutting down effective  September 30 , 2008 and the DRM license key servers will be taken offline. [ 57 ]   Walmart  - In August 2007,  Walmart 's online music division started offering (DRM-free) MP3s as an option. Starting in February 2008, they made all sales DRM-free. On  September 26 , 2008, the Walmart Music Team notified its customers via email they would will be shutting down their DRM servers  October 9 , 2008 and any DRM-encumbered music acquired from them will no longer be accessible unless ripped to a non-DRM format before that date. [ 58 ]   After bad press and negative reaction from customers, on October 9, 2008, Walmart decided not to take its DRM servers offline.  [ 59 ]   Fictionwise  /  Overdrive  - In  January 2009 ,  OverDrive  informed  Fictionwise  that they would no longer be providing downloads for purchasers of  e-books  through Fictionwise as of 31 January 2009. No reason was provided as to Fictionwise why they were being shutdown. This prevents previous purchases from being able to renew their books on new devices [ 60 ] . Fictionwise is working to provide replacement ebooks for its customers in alternative, non-DRM formats, but does not have the rights to provide all of the books in different formats [ 60 ] .   Ads for Adobe PDF  - Also in  January 2009 ,  Adobe Systems  announced that as of  March 2009  they would no longer operate the servers that served ads to their  PDF  reader. Depending on the restriction settings used when the protected documents were created, the PDFs may no longer be readable [ 61 ] .   Gears of War  - The popular video game  Gears of War  became unplayable when the certificate for the DRM system expired on 28 January 2009, preventing the game from starting. Players were able to reset their computers' clocks to allow it to continue to function, but as of  January 2009  the publisher had only issued a statement that they were ""notified of the failure and were working with  Microsoft  to get it resolved"" [ 62 ] .     [ edit ]   Historical note   A very early implementation of DRM was the Software Service System (SSS) devised by the Japanese engineer Ryoichi Mori in 1983  [ 63 ]  and subsequently refined under the name  superdistribution . The SSS was based on encryption, with specialized hardware that controlled decryption and also enabled payments to be sent to the copyright holder. The underlying principle of the SSS and subsequently of superdistribution was that the distribution of encrypted digital products should be completely unrestricted and that users of those products would not just be permitted to redistribute them but would actually be encouraged to do so.

Bart's  PE  Builder helps you build a ""BartPE"" (Bart  Preinstalled Environment) bootable Windows CD-Rom or DVD from the  original Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 installation/setup CD, very  suitable for PC maintenance tasks.    It will give you a complete Win32 environment with network support, a  graphical user interface (800x600) and FAT/NTFS/CDFS filesystem  support. Very handy for burn-in testing systems with no OS, rescuing files to a  network share, virus scan and so on.  This will replace any Dos bootdisk in no time!         Â Introduction   PE Builder is not a Microsoft product and does not create Microsoft  Windows Preinstallation Environment (""Windows PE""). Using  PE   Builder does not grant you a license to Microsoft Windows  PE   or to  use the Windows XP or Server 2003 binaries in a manner other  than stated in the End-User License Agreement included in your version  of Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. Microsoft has not reviewed or tested  PE   Builder and does not endorse its use.     Please do not contact Microsoft for support on the preinstallation environment that has been created by  PE   Builder!  Microsoft does not provide support for  PE   Builder or for the preinstallation environment created by  PE   Builder.    The  PE   Builder program (pebuilder.exe) runs on Windows 2000/XP/2003/BartPE. It does  not  run on Windows NT4/ME/9x.    To avoid any confusion, the bootable CD generated by  PE   Builder should be called by its nickname ""BartPE""!      A word from the author  Hi, my name is  Bart Lagerweij . I've been creating DOS based boot disks and bootable CD-Roms from Dos 3.x (not sure what  year) until 2002. I have created the:  Corporate Modboot ,  Network bootdisk ,  CD-Rom bootdisk , a hardware independent Dos CD-Rom driver  eltorito.sys  and lots of other tools needed to boot a PC the way I want it to.    As you can read above I've stopped doing that in 2002. Why? I saw a Windows PE  (WinPE) bootable CD-Rom (from Microsoft) in action and I got  very, very curious. I knew then as I know now, that in time PE-based solutions will be  every PC technicians best friend.  Goodbye to all the good and bad dos-based NTFS utilities! Now we can boot from a CD-Rom and have  full read/write access to NTFS  volumes !    Here are a few things that are possible with PE  and are  not  possible  with any type of dos-based boot disk, even when using network support and ntfsdos:     Accessing very large (>2TB) NTFS volumes or accessing volumes that are not  seen by the BIOS, like some fibre channel disks.   Very reliable scanning and cleaning of viruses on NTFS volumes using a ""clean boot"".   Active Directory support.   Have remote control over other machines, using vnc or remote desktop.      While I was already thinking about what great things this could do, I noticed the end-user license agreement for Microsoft software that is  included with Windows Preinstallation Environment (Windows PE) 1.2 (eula.txt). In section ""1. ELIGIBILITY."" it states the following:   ...""You may only install and use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT if you are an  active Microsoft Software Assurance Member (""SAM"") for the systems  product pool or servers product pool, if you currently have license coverage for  Microsoft Windows operating system (OS) Upgrades via a Campus Agreement or  School Agreement, or if you are a current or former participant in the Windows  XP Joint Development Program, Windows XP Rapid Adoption Program, Windows .NET  Server Joint Development Program, or Windows .NET Server Rapid Adoption Program.  If you do not meet one or more of the requirements listed above, you may not  install or use this SOFTWARE PRODUCT and you must terminate the installation of  this SOFTWARE PRODUCT immediately""...    Oops, that does not include me. As a matter a fact that does not include most of us! This was very disappointing. But then I started thinking, how difficult can it be to build  something similar to Windows PE  from a Windows XP installation CD-Rom? A quick file compare looked like most of the needed files are on the Windows XP CD-Rom. Only because I thought building this would be easy, I started coding my own builder program. Had I known how hard it would be, I would probably never have started programming PE  Builder.  This first version (v1.0.0) of PE  Builder was released on April 28, 2003. Yes, version 1 was a very simple, very static, very bad and copyright violating program. And the (very friendly) people at Microsoft had every right to kick my butt. But I learned from it and in May 2003 I started on a second version. In July (three months later) v2 was ready.  Version 2 did not have the problems that version 1 had. The version 2 build engine had its own registry hive builder which was not easy to  program and took about 50% of my research and coding time. It also was dynamic enough that it could build from Windows XP and Server 2003. In v2.0.1 I added a small but very powerful menu program called nu2menu, which was written by my buddy Henk de Jong. The latest 2 version (v2.0.2b) even used a new ISO filesystem called ""ISO-9660:1999 (version 2)"" instead of the Joliet extensions. Some non-English versions of Windows XP had filenames longer than the  maximum allowed length for Joliet filenames (103 chars). I had to patch the ISO building program (mkisofs.exe) so that the  Windows NT bootstrap and setup loader would boot properly. The file and directory names can now be up to 207 characters. But again this version had something bad. When comparing some INF files they looked too much like the Windows PE  builder from  Microsoft.    I had to change the entire INF file layout to use its own format. And on Sep 1, 2003 (almost 6 months after starting) version 3 was ready. After adding plugin support, PE  Builder got very popular. People from all over the world are writing their own plugins to add the program they like and use.       BartPE vs. Windows PE?     BartPE is not supported by Microsoft. Windows  PE   is an official Microsoft product.   BartPE has a graphical user interface. Windows  PE   has a command line interface.   The tools needed to make a BartPE installation are free software. Windows  PE   is available only to Microsoft OEM users.   BartPE allows unlimited custom plugins. Windows  PE   has a limited range of plugins options.     What is the technical difference between BartPE and Windows PE?     Target - Microsoft sees Windows  PE   as an installation platform. Bart sees Windows  PE   as the next generation rescue platform.    Start-menu - Bart's builder gives you a simple, dynamic and powerful start-menu (Nu2Menu, see  screenshots ). Microsoft's builder does not give you a start-menu, it uses a command prompt.    Build from - Bart's builder can also build from Windows XP Home  Edition or from a preinstalled Windows XP version (without CD).    Plugins - With  PE   Builder you can easily add applications, drivers or tools using plugins.  This makes  PE   Builder extremely powerful. The end user can even combine plugins  from different software vendors into one CD image.      Network support -  PE Builder includes its own network support tools (bartpe/penetcfg) to start  TCP/IP and Microsoft Client. The TCP/IP settings like: dynamic/static  ip-address, subnet-mask, default gateway, dns-servers computer-name, workgroup can  be changed on-the-fly. You can create pre-defined profiles, that you can select.  Microsoft Windows  PE   only supports DHCP or fixed settings using winbom.ini.  Also there is a plugin (NwDskPe) created by Erwin Veermans that loads the Netware Client on BartPE (IP/IPX).     Fileshare - BartPE can start File Sharing support so you can connect to the system through a share.     VNC - Because of the File Sharing support you can also run UltraVNC.    Dos support - Bart's builder has a plugin called ""dospe"".    License - Microsoft Windows  PE   is only for Enterprise/OEM customers (see previous), BartPE is for everybody!    64-Bit - Bart's builder does not support Windows 64-bit editions.       Requirements to build:     The files from your Windows Installation CD-Rom.  Supported Windows versions are:     Windows XP Home Edition (must be slip streamed with Service Pack 1 or higher)   Windows XP Professional (must be slip streamed with Service Pack 1 or higher)   Windows Server 2003, Web Edition   Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition   Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition       PE Builder runs on Windows 2000/XP/2003/BartPE systems.   CD/DVD writer if you want to creat a bootable CD/DVD.     Why did I build  PE   Builder?  Microsoft only provides Windows  PE   to OEM and Enterprise customers. So the small companies and end users do not get Windows PE. I think this is  really bad. With  PE   Builder they can build a Bootable XP CD-Rom (called BartPE) to  use for maintaining their systems.               Â Licensing issues  In order to make a BartPE installation, your must have a properly licensed copy of the operating system. BartPE does not grant users who do not have a proper Windows XP/2003 license the right to use a BartPE installation.    Also, according to the Microsoft EULA for Windows XP/2003, a user may not simultaneously use more installations of these operating systems than the user has license(s) for. This also goes for BartPE. In practice this means that the user may not use, for instance, a single license installation on one computer while simultaneously using a BartPE installation (created using that license) on another computer.    More information:     Your local Microsoft Windows end-user license agreement ( c:\WINDOWS\system32\eula.txt )   PE Builder license file          Â Getting started  This page will help you create your very first BartPE CD. It assumes that you are using Windows XP.       Make sure that your system has about 500MB of free disk space!        Download  the latest  PE   Builder version (self-installing package) and install it.       Start  PE   Builder (pebuilder.exe). When you start  PE   Builder for the first time it will ask if you agree with the license agreement.       Now  PE   Builder will ask to search for windows installation  files. If you don't have your windows XP setup/installation files on your system  you must insert the original Microsoft Windows XP installation/setup CD at this  point.   The files you have at  c:\windows  are not installation files. They are your already installed files!  Click ""yes"" to start searching. PE Builder will now search all fixed- and CD-Rom drives for Windows installation files. This will take some time. When more than one valid location is found, a dialog will appear where you can  select which location you want to use.       At the main  PE   Builder dialog, select the ""Burn to CD/DVD"" option. When you are using an erasable medium, make sure that the ""AutoErase RW"" option is enabled. The ""burn using"" option should be set to ""StarBurn"". Select your CD writer device from the Device list.       Hit the ""build"" button. PE Builder will now ask you to create a  BartPE  directory, answer with ""yes"".       The license for your Microsoft Windows XP product is shown. Read it and agree to it to continue.       PE Builder will now start building BartPE. This will take a few minutes.  You will see a lot of files getting copied and/or decompressed, the ISO image  build and the data recorded to your CD/DVD writer.  If the data verify was correct and there where no errors reported you can boot the CD/DVD!

clueweb09-en0001-46-03199	"Dot Net Perls Firefox 3 Memory Benchmarks, Comparison by  Sam Allen Problem Many people load  hundreds of web pages , often over periods of 3+ hours. Users complain about the memory usage of Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer, and we need a way to identify which browsers are better at managing memory. Traditional benchmarks do not look at all the things you might do with a program, and we need real-world numbers over a period of hours. Solution I developed a Windows Forms application in .NET called Memory Watcher that ""watches"" the system memory numbers. It uses a timer to poll the processes  every 3 seconds . It then records every number, which allows us to keep track of each program's memory usage over time and with real-world usage. I collected over 1 million data points over 14+ hours. Memory profiles These results are from opening Memory Watcher and then using the browser between 9,000 and 11,000 seconds--close to 3 hours. Each browser is tested in a  separate session , and there are brief periods of inactivity throughout the time period. The vertical axis is the memory used in MB, and the horizontal axis contains the memory ""checkpoints"" my program took (one every 3 seconds). Benchmark details The above profiles are not a direct comparison in any way, but they offer a visualization of  trending  in the memory behavior of the layout engines and interfaces. This is not a diagnosis or bug report. Let me show some important metrics of the above results. Browser name Exact version Time active (s) Hours Comments Safari 3.1.2 10,470 s 2.91 hours Normal browsing Firefox 3.0 9,681 s 2.69 hours Normal browsing No extensions Flock 1.2.2 10,146 s 2.82 hours Flock is based on Firefox 2.0 No extensions other than the default Opera 9.5 9,855 s 2.74 hours No extensions Only browser was used IE 8.0 10,236 s 2.84 hours Used 7.0 rendering mode No extensions The system is Windows Vista SP1, and the computer has 3.0+ GB of RAM. No plugins are disabled, but the Acrobat Reader and Java plugins were (presumably) not used. Flock is based on Firefox 2.0 but its memory usage is probably worse because it uses built-in extensions. Just regular web pages These aren't stress tests, and I probably never went over 4 windows in each browser, with at most 3 tabs in each window. I didn't look at many pages that are extremely heavy on images, and no ""browser benchmark"" style pages. Gmail was used on each browser. Not just pages It is hard for a regular benchmark to ""simulate"" a user actually clicking on things. Interactions with the user can greatly influence memory or performance. Having a responsive browser is probably more important than just having a ""fast"" one at showing pages. Plugins included My profiles include Flash and possibly other plugins. A browser might have memory issues with a plugin and that could cause a significant problem with the user experience. (Most Windows Vista crashes have been due to graphics cards, not Vista itself, for example.) Real-life usage An automation script will never give the same insight into performance over time as will this sort of profile. As developers, we want to make programs that work well for our users, and not just for tests. The tests capture the ""rhythm"" of software usage. Final memory measurements The data in this article are those reported by Windows Vista, but the exact individual numbers  should not be compared  to each other. Some browsers were tested slightly longer than others, and some different pages were loaded. That said, here are the final performance metrics. Browser name Ending private set in MB Safari 636.9 Firefox 3 111.8 Flock (Firefox 2) 191.9 Opera 9.5 190.6 Internet Explorer 194.4 About the ""Memory Watcher"" Memory Watcher is a small program I wrote that records the memory usage of each process on the system every three seconds. It uses the  PrivateMemorySize64  long value from the  Process  collection in .NET. Simple There are tools similar to this, offered on every platform, but they are not usually easy to use. Memory Watcher provides a super-easy way to monitor every process and silently work in the background. Exports to spreadsheet It exports the currently viewed data to a CSV file. These data are easily taken into Excel, and were used for the graphs in this article. Implementation notes The application uses a  DataGridView  control, and sets its  DataSource  property to a DataTable which is built from the object collection. It uses a Timer to poll the system every 3 seconds. It offers searching and filtering of processes using a TextBox. Downloads The program executable and the C# source code is available at my download site, which is linked to at the bottom of the page. You may need to click the Google Code link. Conclusion These profiles are meant to provide a picture of what the memory behavior of popular browsers is over a period of time, not to provide absolute benchmark times. Firefox 3.0 shows memory usage that is significantly lower than Firefox 2, which also does very well. Here is a summary of my results. Safari 3.1 Safari on Windows shows extremely poor memory management, and I do not know whether it ever reaches a high water mark. If this is by design, it is certainly a design that looks inefficient and seems to contradict Apple's marketing. Firefox 3.0 This browser exhibits memory usage that is by far lower than the others. It releases memory to the system and the trend line is nearly flat.  [ Firefox 3 Memory Usage  - pavlov.net] Flock, based on Firefox 2.0 Flock did very well and this browser and Firefox 2.0 could likely be run for long periods without causing many problems. The extensions probably reduced the efficiency somewhat. Opera 9.5 Opera's performance was about as good as Firefox 2.0 (Flock), and it could likely be used for very lengthy sessions. However,  Kestrel  is certainly not a revolutionary or even notable technology in this arena. Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 IE did well in the profile, although a worrying trend in the data could indicate that it would keep escalating. However, this browser could likely sustain many hours of moderate usage. Final thoughts After browsing for 14 hours with these programs, and recording all the results into spreadsheets, the  most memory efficient  browser in my usage is very clear-- Firefox 3.0  not only trumps its older version, but every other popular offering on Windows. This article may help other vendors rethink their marketing campaigns, and may prompt further improvements.

The software is ultimately close to the requirements of user who wants to represent complex idea and knowledge structures and DOESN'T want to study the program for several days or weeks beforehand.       In plain words, Personal Memory Manager allows creating notes (chunks of information), placing them on sheets, and linking them by relations. Every note can have any amount of textual information or attached files. When displayed on sheets, a note can have its own color, image and name. Relations between notes also have their own names; that makes it easy to plan complex structures by simply refining relation types.       But the real magic of Personal Memory Manager is in its sheets concept. Every sheet can be explained as a ""point of view"" on an overall picture; thus, each note can appear in any number of sheets, explaining different aspects of the problem. Moreover, a relation between two notes created on one sheet will be visible on any sheet where both notes are visible. This powerful concept makes possible the creation of ""overview"" sheets; you have several sheets, where aspects are explained in a few notes, then drag ALL those notes to the ""overview sheet"" and see all the relations from all the sheets at once.

Windows 32-bit Operating Systems implement a virtual memory system based on a flat 32-bit address space.Â  32-bits of address space translates into 4GB of virtual memory.Â  A process can access up to 4GB of memory address space (using the /3GB switch changes this behavior - and we'll cover that in a later post).   You can't have a discussion of Memory Management basics, without distinguishing between Kernel-mode and User-mode memory.Â  The system space (aka Kernel space) is the portion of the address space in which the OS and kernel-mode drivers reside.Â  Only kernel-mode code can access this space.Â  User-mode threads can access data only in the context of their own process.Â  User-mode threads cannot access data within another processes space directly, nor can it access the system address space directly.Â  Kernel-mode drivers are trusted by the OS and can access both kernel and user space.Â  When a driver routine is called from a user thread, the thread's data remains in the user-mode space.Â  However, the kernel-mode driver can access the user-mode data for the thread and access the kernel-mode space.   OK - so looking at the diagram above, we can see how the 4GB memory address space is divided.Â  Windows allocates the lower half of the 4GB address space (from 0x00000000 to 0x7FFFFFFF) to processes for their own unique private storage, and reserves the other half (from 0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) for the Operating System's use.Â  Virtual memory provides a view of memory that does not necessarily correspond to the physical layout of memory.   This is usually the point in the discussion where the majority of folks start getting confused and their eyes start to glaze over.Â  In simplistic terms, the memory manager translates the virtual memory addresses into physical addresses where the data is stored.Â  Every page in virtual memory is listed in a page table which in turn identifies the correct physical page.Â  The system and CPU use the information from the virtual address to find the correct page table entry for a specific page.Â     So, looking at the diagram on the left, we can see that a virtual address points to a specific location on a virtual page.Â  The virtual address contains a byte offset and several index values that are used to locate the page table entry that maps the virtual page into physical memory.Â  After the memory manager finds the page table entry, it uses the offset to find a byte in physical memory - identified by a physical address.   And there you have it - a quick look at the basics of Memory Management.Â  Over the course of the next few posts on Memory Management, we'll talk a bit more about the following topics:Pool Memory, Memory Tuning, Troubleshooting Memory IssuesÂ and the infamous /3GB switch.

Process share memory as they reference a single instance of a DLL. Your web page points IPC and data transfer on disk (in bytes/ sec or quantity of bytes). Note that if an executable loads, only a piece of it loads, and only rerferenced part of the DLL needed loads : a vitualization. As features of the executable are used, then it is paged from disk. the memory manager has to calculate how much physical memory a process needs. It must involve an algorithm based on a prediction schedule obtained from a prefetch file, or something like that. Cool web site.                  #    re: Memory Management 101              Tuesday, July 15, 2008 11:28 PM     by  Charles Kudla            Â  Being a functional illiterate, I'm tired of low memory on the hard drive and warning messages.

From  uCertify.com , for About.com    See More About: microsoft exams study tips mcdst virtual memory              Virtual memory is a temporary storage in the hard disk for storing additional data in the RAM. When the physical memory (RAM) is exhausted, operating systems (such as Windows 95/98, NT, and 2000) move the data corresponding to older processes from the RAM to the virtual memory area on the hard disk. Hence, space is created in the RAM for the newer processes. Virtual memory is simulated RAM created by using a portion of the hard disk as a swap file. Although this extends the computer's capabilities to execute the process even when RAM is not sufficient, it slows down the processes and programs that use virtual memory and those that need to read and write to the hard disk.

The diagnostic includes a comprehensive set of memory tests. If you are experiencing problems while running Windows, you can use the diagnostic to determine whether the problems are caused by failing hardware, such as RAM or the memory system of your motherboard. Windows Memory Diagnostic is designed to be easy and fast. On most configurations, you can download the diagnostic, read the documentation, run the test and complete the first test pass in less than 30 minutes.    To run Windows Memory Diagnostic, you must reboot your computer with the disk or CD-ROM on which you installed Windows Memory Diagnostic in the drive. After the reboot, Windows Memory Diagnostic will load and its interface will appear. After loading, the first test pass will begin, using the default standard test suite, and continue until complete, unless Windows Memory Diagnostic is either paused or exited. Once the first test pass is complete, Windows Memory Diagnostic will begin a second test pass using the same settings as before. Windows Memory Diagnostic will continue to run test passes until you exit.

However, you can still use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool on computers configured to use languages other than English.       To use Windows Memory Diagnostic, your computer must have either a 3.5-inch floppy drive or CD-ROM drive.              We recommend that you print this users' guide, so that you have it available as a reference when running Windows Memory Diagnostic. While Windows Memory Diagnostic is running, you will be unable to access this file.     Microsoft would like your feedback on Windows Memory Diagnostic. Once you have used Windows Memory Diagnostic, please let us know what you think by completing the short survey at the  Microsoft Web site . (http://www.hwdev.org/memory/survey.aspx)        Windows Memory Diagnostic tests the Random Access Memory (RAM) on your computer for errors. If you are experiencing problems while running Windows, you can use Windows Memory Diagnostic to determine whether the problems are caused by failing hardware,  such as RAM or the memory system of your motherboard. If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports any errors, then one or more memory components is failing.    To run Windows Memory Diagnostic, you must first set up Windows Memory Diagnostic on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or CD-ROM.      Go to the directory where you saved the Windows Memory Diagnostic executable file,  mtinst.exe .   Double-click  mtinst.exe  to start Windows Memory Diagnostic Setup. Depending on your security settings, the  File Download  dialog box might appear when you run mtinst.exe. If it appears, click  Open  to start Windows Memory Diagnostic Setup. Other security dialog boxes might also appear. This can happen, for example, if you try to install Windows Memory Diagnostic from a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) shared folder. These dialog boxes are related to your security settings and not to Windows Memory Diagnostic. If you experience problems when you are trying to install Windows Memory Diagnostic, either be sure to run Mtinst.exe from your local computer, or review your security settings and the documentation included in your version of Windows.   Do either of the following:       Click  Create Startup Disk  to install Windows Memory Diagnostic on a floppy disk.            Select the floppy disk drive that you want to use from the list provided.       Insert a formatted floppy disk into this drive and then click  Create . When the installation is complete, the  Success  dialog box will appear.              Or, click  Save CD Image to Disk  if you want to create a CD-ROM that you can use to start your computer.            Select a location where you want to save the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9660 image and then click  Save . When the file has been saved, the  Success  dialog box will appear.       For more information about creating a CD-ROM that you can boot from, see the Note at the end of this section.                 Restart your computer with the disk on which you installed Windows Memory Diagnostic (either the floppy or CD-ROM drive).        Important           In the boot sequence, the drive with the Windows Memory Diagnostic disk must precede any other devices on which there is a bootable program, such as a hard disk on which Windows is installed.    You can configure the boot sequence in the BIOS settings. On most computers, the default boot sequence includes the floppy drive. For more information about configuring the boot sequence, see the documentation for your motherboard.                Note       If you want to create a CD-ROM that you can start your computer from, you must use additional software to create this CD-ROM from the ISO 9660 image, which is named Windiag.iso. To create this CD-ROM from the image, you can use the Cdburn.exe utility, which is provided as part of the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools. Instructions for downloading and installing these tools are available at the  Microsoft Web site (http://www.microsoft.com/) . Instructions for using Cdburn.exe are included in the download package. In addition, you must have a CD-ROM drive that can write to CD-ROMs. These drives are typically called CD-R or CD-RW drives. Your CD-ROM drive must also support CD-ROMs that you can boot from. Consult the documentation for your CD-ROM drive for more information.        Running Windows Memory Diagnostic    Important     Be sure to remove the floppy disk or CD-ROM on which you installed Windows Memory Diagnostic when you finish using it. Otherwise, Windows Memory Diagnostic, and not Windows, will start again after your computer is rebooted.      After creating the floppy disk or CD-ROM, you must restart your computer with the disk or CD-ROM on which you installed Windows Memory Diagnostic in the disk drive.  After you restart your computer, Windows Memory Diagnostic loads and its interface appears. After loading, the first test pass begins and continues until complete, unless you pause or exit Windows Memory Diagnostic.  Once the first test pass is complete, Windows Memory Diagnostic begins a second test pass using the same settings as before. Windows Memory Diagnostic  continues to run test passes until you exit it.       Understanding Windows Memory Diagnostic results     If Windows Memory Diagnostic completes the first pass and reports no errors, then your RAM is probably working correctly.  It is unlikely that Windows Memory Diagnostic will find any errors with your RAM on subsequent passes using the same settings.  If you want to test your RAM more completely, you can run the extended test suite by pressing  T  while Windows Memory Diagnostic is running. You should then let Windows Memory Diagnostic run overnight. If you change the test suite or any of Windows Memory Diagnostic settings, the test pass will restart from the beginning.    If Windows Memory Diagnostic detects any errors with your RAM, the screen is updated with information about the error. A result of Failed for a test indicates that particular test detected an error. If any tests fail, then your computer has failing hardware.     If Windows Memory Diagnostic detects errors in your hardware, you should correct the errors and run Windows Memory Diagnostic again until you get a report of no errors before you attempt to run Windows again. If you do not, Windows may not work correctly. You can attempt to identify the specific failing memory component.  However, if errors are detected and your computer is under warranty, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer for troubleshooting.       Using Windows Memory Diagnostic to troubleshoot    For some hardware configurations, Windows Memory Diagnostic can identify the specific failing memory component.  If Windows Memory Diagnostic can successfully isolate all the errors detected to one or more corresponding memory modules,  the  View errors by memory module  option will be available in the menu. You can use this option to determine which  specific memory modules are failing and need to be removed or replaced. If the option is not available, you can try to  manually identify the failing memory component, as described below.      Manually identifying failing memory components    To manually identify the failing memory component,  you must open your computer's case and work with sensitive internal hardware. Doing this can result in damage to your hardware.  If you do not have experience working with your hardware or do not want to chance damaging your hardware,  you can still use Windows Memory Diagnostic to test your RAM, but you should contact a third party to do the actual work on your hardware.  If your computer is not under warranty or you are experienced working with sensitive internal hardware then you can attempt  to isolate the failing hardware. Review the following recommendations and guidelines before attempting to work with your hardware:        Review documentation for all relevant hardware, including your motherboard, RAM, and computer case.    If any of your components are ""over-clocked"" (that is, if their clock speed is increased above default values), reset the components to their default clock values and rerun Windows Memory Diagnostic.    You must ground yourself before touching any internal hardware components, such as the motherboard or RAM modules. Grounding yourself removes any static electrical charge your body might be carrying. To ground yourself, you can wear antistatic wrist straps or you can do the following:         Turn off the computer.      Touch an unpainted metal part of your computer case with your hand.      Plant your feet and do not walk around (because walking can produce static electrical build-up). If you do need to walk around after grounding yourself, you must re-ground yourself as described in this procedure.             If you do not know how many memory modules are installed in your computer, you should review your motherboard documentation to determine where the memory sockets are. Then, open your case, locate the memory sockets, and count the number of memory modules. Once you have determined the number of memory modules, you can use the following procedures to try and isolate the source of the hardware problems.     The first step is to try reseating your memory module. In studies done at Microsoft, this fixes the problem one-third of the time on desktop systems and one-quarter of the time on laptop systems.    To reseat one or more memory modules       Do one of the following:         If you used the  View errors by memory module  option and Windows Memory Diagnostic was able to identify the specific failing memory module(s), then remove only that module or modules. Be sure to note which slots contained those memory modules.      Otherwise, remove all memory modules from their slots on the motherboard. Be sure to note which slots contained the memory modules.        Gently remove any dust or debris from the memory module slots on the motherboard.    Firmly reinsert the memory modules into their original slot on the motherboard.    Rerun the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool.      If, after reseating all memory modules, Windows Memory Diagnostic continues to identify errors then you can try one of the following procedures to identify the specific failing components.    To troubleshoot errors on a computer with one memory module       Obtain a memory module that you know is working correctly.    Replace the memory module currently in your computer with the one that works correctly.    Rerun Windows Memory Diagnostic and then do one of the following:         If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports zero errors, you can conclude that the original memory module is failing.      If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports errors, then your motherboard may be failing. Contact the manufacturer of the motherboard.             To troubleshoot errors on a computer with more than one memory module      Remove all memory modules but one.    Rerun Windows Memory Diagnostic and then do one of the following:         If no errors are reported, remove the current memory module and add one from the set of memory modules that you previously removed.      If errors are reported, remove the current memory module, making sure to separate it from the other memory modules.           Add a new memory module from the set of memory modules that have not yet been tested.    Rerun Windows Memory Diagnostic.    Repeat this procedure until all the memory modules have been tested.      Notes      On some systems with slow floppy drives, Windows Memory Diagnostic may require more time to load before it can begin testing. The loading progress is represented by periods ( . ) displayed after the  Loading  message, which appears when Windows Memory Diagnostic starts.    If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports errors on all memory modules, the motherboard may be failing. Contact the manufacturer of the motherboard.    Be aware that there may be problems with your RAM or other hardware that Windows Memory Diagnostic cannot detect. That is, if Windows Memory Diagnostic reports no errors, it is not proof that your hardware is working correctly.    During those tests that run with the microprocessor cache off, there can be a time delay between when a key is pressed and when Windows Memory Diagnostic responds.        To confirm its accuracy, Microsoft has tested Windows Memory Diagnostic with more than 70 different motherboard, motherboard chipset, and RAM combinations.              Top     Appendix    System requirements    Windows Memory Diagnostic supports x86-based computers with the following microprocessors:               Intel - Pentium or Celeron families                 AMD - K6, Athlon, or Duron families                 Microprocessors compatible with those listed above             You can test all types of RAM that run on x86-based computers with the supported microprocessors. However, if you have error checking and correcting (ECC) RAM, Windows Memory Diagnostic may not report any errors because the ECC mechanism automatically detects and corrects the error. It might still be useful to run Windows Memory Diagnostic if you have ECC RAM because it may detect errors that the ECC RAM is unable to correct (which indicates problems with the RAM).    Windows Memory Diagnostic is limited to testing only the first 4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM. If you have more than 4 GB of RAM, the remaining RAM after the first 4 GB will not be tested by Windows Memory Diagnostic.     Windows Memory Diagnostic user interface     While Windows Memory Diagnostic is running, you will see the user interface, which is divided into five sections:      The menu at the top of the screen provides access to configuration options.   The top screen (below the menu options) displays information about the test that is being run and shows progress indicators for the entire pass, the current test, and the memory range.   The left half of the middle of the screen displays a summary of the result of recent tests and passes that have been run.   The right half of the middle of the screen is the system memory map and displays the range of memory locations currently being tested.   The bottom of the screen displays a summary of errors. If errors are detected, then data about the error will be displayed. Otherwise, a default message is displayed, which indicates that no errors have been detected.      Options    This table describes the options that are available at the top of the screen, depending upon the current status of Windows Memory Diagnostic.           Option     Description           ( P ) Pause     Pauses Windows Memory Diagnostic. To access the additional menu options, you must first pause Windows Memory Diagnostic.           ( X ) Exit     Immediately exits Windows Memory Diagnostic and restarts the computer. You must remove Windows Memory Diagnostic from either the floppy disk drive or the CD-ROM drive to start Windows.           ( T ) Run extended tests     Runs the extended test suite. This collection of tests will test your RAM more thoroughly and require more time to run. This menu option is available only when the standard tests are being run.           ( T ) Run standard tests     Runs the standard test suite. This menu option is available only when a test suite other than the standard test suite is being run.           ( C ) Resume     Returns Windows Memory Diagnostic from a paused state and resumes testing. This option is available only when Windows Memory Diagnostic is paused.           ( M ) Menu     Provides advanced configuration options. This option is available only when Windows Memory Diagnostic is paused.           ( Tab /Arrow keys) Navigate     Using the tab key, you can navigate around the Windows Memory Diagnostic screen. Using the arrow keys, you can scroll and review the data in certain areas of the screen.           Menu options     To access the following menu options, from the main interface screen, press  P  to pause Windows Memory Diagnostic and then press  M  (Menu). The menu options available will vary, depending upon whether errors have been detected and whether the system information is available to Windows Memory Diagnostic.           Option     Description           View errors by memory module     Displays the errors, sorted by the memory module in which the errors occurred. You can use this option to identify the specific failing memory module. This option is available only if memory errors are detected and can be isolated to a specific corresponding memory module.           View errors by test     Displays the error, sorted by the test that detected them. This option is available only if memory errors are detected.           View system information     Displays information about the memory modules installed in your computer, including the module type, the module manufacturer, and the slot on the motherboard in which the module is installed. The amount of information displayed can vary, depending upon the memory module. This option is available only if system information is detected.           AdvancedÂ options     Displays the following additional advanced configuration options:           Change cache settings . You can choose whether to run all tests in the selected suite with the microprocessor cache on or off. Turning the cache off will increase the time for the test to complete and provides more thorough testing.       Change the memory map . You can choose to use an extended memory map rather than the default standard map. Using the extended memory map approximately doubles the time each test takes to complete and more thoroughly tests the RAM.       Change the test suite . You can choose between the basic, standard, or extended test suite. You can also select from among all available tests to customize the test suite.                    About Windows Memory Diagnostic     Displays version information about Windows Memory Diagnostic.              Selecting a test suite    The default test suite is the standard test suite.  It begins running when you start Windows Memory Diagnostic.  If you want to change the test suite, you can select the extended test suite by pressing  T  while Windows Memory Diagnostic is running.  In addition to the standard and extended test suites, you can also select the basic test suite or create a custom test suite.  To select a test suite other than the standard or extended test suite, go to the  Advanced Options  menu  (described in the previous ""Menu options"" table) and then select  Change the test suite . This will show you more information and provide additional suite configuration options.       How Windows Memory Diagnostic works    To test the RAM on your computer, Windows Memory Diagnostic runs a test pass, which consists of all the tests that are included in the currently selected test suite. While Windows Memory Diagnostic is running, status indicators display the progress of the test pass, the individual test, and the range of memory addresses that are currently being tested. Once the test pass is complete, Windows Memory Diagnostic starts over and begins a second pass, using the same set of tests. These repeated test passes continue until you exit Windows Memory Diagnostic or change the configuration of the test suite. The default test suite is the standard test suite.    If Windows Memory Diagnostic completes the first pass using the standard test suite and reports no errors, then your RAM is probably working correctly. It is unlikely that Windows Memory Diagnostic will find any errors with your RAM on subsequent passes using the same settings. If you want to test your RAM more completely, you can run the extended test suite overnight. You can also create a custom test suite or change the test configuration using advanced options.    If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports any errors, you should correct the errors in the memory system and run Windows Memory Diagnostic again until you get a report of no errors before attempting to run Windows again. Otherwise, Windows may not work correctly. There are several components that comprise the memory system including the individual RAM modules, the memory sockets on the motherboard, the motherboard chipset, the microprocessor, and the microprocessor cache. In some cases, the memory modules may not be correctly installed in the motherboard memory socket, which would cause memory errors even though the modules are not failing.    In some cases, Windows Memory Diagnostic can identify the specific memory module that is failing. If, however, Windows Memory Diagnostic is unable to identify the specific memory module that is failing, you can use the procedures described in this guide to attempt to isolate which hardware component is failing. However, only the hardware manufacturer can confirm for certain that the hardware is defective.    Note                Be aware that there may be problems with your RAM or other hardware that Windows Memory Diagnostic cannot detect. That is, if Windows Memory Diagnostic reports no errors, it is not proof that your hardware is working correctly. If Windows Memory Diagnostic reports no errors, but you continue to experience errors that might be caused by failing hardware, you should get technical assistance to troubleshoot your hardware more extensively.           Memory tests    Windows Memory Diagnostic includes a comprehensive set of memory tests that provide varying degrees of testing thoroughness. The tests are organized into three predefined test suites: basic, standard, and extended. These categories reflect, in increasing order, the time for each test to run as well as the probability of the test detecting errors. The standard test suite includes all of the tests in the basic and standard categories. The extended test suite includes all of the tests in the standard test suite plus the tests from the extended category. The extended test suite takes the longest time to run and is the most thorough test suite.    Each test consists of a testing algorithm, a microprocessor cache setting of either on or off, and a test pattern. Each algorithm is designed to identify a certain type of memory error. The algorithms are combined with different microprocessor cache settings and test patterns to identify different types of errors.    Types of memory errors    Window Memory Diagnostic tests are designed to identify the following types of memory errors:      An error that occurs when a memory address fails to retain its assigned value    An error called a coupling fault, which occurs when a memory address is altered by writes to other addresses on the same memory device      To determine whether a memory address fails to retain its assigned value, Windows Memory Diagnostic writes a test pattern, such as all zeroes or all ones, into the memory address and then reads the actual value stored in the memory address. If the actual value does not match the expected value (which is the original test pattern written into the address), then there is an error in the memory system.   To determine whether there is a coupling fault, Windows Memory Diagnostic writes a test pattern into a memory address. Next, several other memory addresses on the same device are written to. Finally, the value in the first memory address is read to see if it has changed. If the value in the first memory address has changed (as a result of data being written to other addresses on the device), then a coupling fault has occurred and there is an error in the memory system.        Sample run times   This table lists the time it takes for Windows Memory Diagnostic to run one test pass of the standard test suite.           Configuration     Amount of time required to complete the standard test pass               Pentium II, 233 MHz     128 MB RAM        8 minutes, 32 seconds               Pentium III, 1 GHz     256 MB RAM        5 minutes               PentiumÂ 4,Â 2.8Â GHz     1 GB RAM        7 minutes, 25 seconds           Athlon XP 2000+, 1.67 GHz    400 MB RAM        4 minutes, 30 seconds                  Top   Glossary          Microprocessor cache     A cache is a temporary storage system that improves performance by providing quick access to data. In this document, cache refers specifically to that part of the microprocessor that is used to hold data retrieved from memory modules. If the processor needs to access memory that already resides in the cache, it can do so quickly without requiring slower access to the memory module. The type and amount of cache varies by processor. In Windows Memory Diagnostic, some diagnostic tests are performed with the cache disabled to force the processor to access the memory module for every address.       Memory module      A small circuit board that contains multiple memory chips. Memory modules are installed on the main circuit board of a personal computer (also known as the motherboard). Memory modules are designed to be removable and many motherboards have two to four memory module sockets in which the memory modules are installed.

There are movie streaming websites like Hulu that provide access to tv shows of certain TV networks to users from specific countries. Many TV stations offer streams of their contents on the Internet as well Thatâs the basic concept of  RevoluTV  which provides a central interface for free TV stations that stream their shows.    It is more a convenience than something revolutionary because programs and websites that do the same already exist for some time. The biggest advantage of RevoluTV is the no frills no thrills interface that is clean and easily accessible. It makes use of Windows Media Player to stream the TV contents to the computer screen which unfortunately means that the software program will only run on computers with Windows XP or Windows Vista.   Channels are divided into themes like News, Games or Kids which list the available TV streams. A click on a network name will load the channel immediately which works well and without lags. It usually takes a few seconds to buffer the stream before a picture is shown.    Playback quality depends a lot on the userâs Internet connection but also on the type of backbone the TV network is using to stream their contents.     Channels can be added to favorites for faster access. There is however no settings menu of any kind. Basic controls for volume and playback are offered but nothing beyond that. The only way to change settings would probably be to change them in Windows Media Player.           Like such posts? Get updates via  RSS NEWS FEED .  Love Ghacks?   Find out how you can help!

The ideal would be to have a computing system with an integrated phone system for ultimate compatibility, convenience, and efficiency but business owners often get bogged down by multiple systems that dont work in harmony.   With a virtual PBX phone system from RingCentral, you can avoid the worry of installing complicated hardware and take advantage of integrating your phone system with Microsoft Office and Outlook. This integrated phone system will fit seamlessly into your operating system, making your office's infrastructure streamlined, affordable, efficient, and easy to use.   Make calls directly from Outlook, receive faxes and voicemail in your Outlook inbox, and get numbers from your Outlook contacts. Send faxes directly from Word, Excel and PowerPoint with just one click of your mouse to dial any number in your contact list.

You can use this feature to change the brightness of the entire screen.     Preventing application crash by using exception handling mechanism  When a program does something wrong, for example, reading from invalid memory address, the operating system displays a ""crash"" window with information about the problem that caused the exception, and terminates the application. This sample project demonstrates how to avoid this kind of crashes, display your own exception information window, and allow the user to continue running the application after the exception occurred.

By  David Bolton , About.com    See More About: systems programs programming language operating system computer programs               What Does A  Programming Language Do?:   A programming language is used to write computer   programs  such as     Applications     Utilities    Servers   Systems Programs   A program is written as a series of human understandable computer instructions that can be read by a  compiler  and  linker , and translated into  machine code  so that a computer can understand and run it.      Find out more about Compilers and Interpreters   Are There Many Programs In A Computer?:   From the moment you turn on your computer, it is running programs, carrying out instructions, testing your  ram , resetting all attached devices and loading the   operating system  from hard disk or CD-Rom.    Each and every operation that your computer performs has instructions that someone had to write in a programming language. These had to be created, compiled and tested- a long and complex task.    An operating system like Microsoft's Windows Vista took millions of man hours to write and test the software.    What is an Operating System?   Examples Of Programming Languages:   These languages include  Assembler ,   C  or  C++ .  A computer motherboard with the  CPU ,  RAM  and  ROM ), the instructions to  boot  the computer are limited to a small amount of  memory in the boot ROM chip and so are usually written in assembler.  Operating  systems  like  Linux  or  Windows  are written in C and C++.     Understanding what Software Is   C++ For Beginners   C For Beginners   Traditional Programming Languages:   In the late 40s and early 50s, computer programs were entered by flicking switches. It was quickly realised how inefficient and slow that was and computer languages soon appeared.    Thousands of programming languages have been invented since then, many as PhD research projects, but only a few have been really successful. Through the 60s and 70s, these languages :    Fortran  Cobol  Basic   all ruled the roost but declined when better languages came into being. Basic hung in there the longest but is now declining.    Learn Delphi Programming   Want To Learn Visual Basic?   Focus On Java What Programming Languages Are Now In Use?:   It is mainly Java and C++ with  C#   starting to gain popularity and C holding its own. There have been many attempts to automate this process, and have computers write  computer programs but the complexity is such that for now, humans still write the best computer programs.    More advanced techniques, for  instance using     Objects   Generics    Multi-threading     mean that the modern programming languages are far more powerful.    Programming Languages - What Are They?   How Are These Newer Programming Languages Better?:   Lower level languages like     Assembly Language    C,   C++    Force the programmer to think more about the problem in computer terms, instead of the business logic. Less about payrolls and more about how the data is stored.     C#  though does not use pointers, so that removes the chances of a  pointer  being corrupted or not freed. The  .NET  runtime handles things like  garbage collection , so the developer doesn't have to reinvent this wheel. The Future Of Programming Languages:   The most popular programming languages are currently :    C  C++  Java   ( Sources: tiobe.com ). As computers get faster, have more RAM,  applications  will get more complex, it is likely that more development will shift from C++ to the higher level languages such as Java and C#.     Microsoft have put a lot of faith in C# as their answer to Java and have the financial leverage to continue plugging it for a very long time. I expect both Java and C# to become the two dominant programming languages.     Interest In Programming As A Career?

Pusher  is a tool that installs world-famous Installer.app that gives access to numerous award-winning tools for the iPhone and allows you to use best of both App Store and Installer without compromising your security. Download for  Mac OS X  or  Windows . Pusher will put Installer.app onto your 2.0.2, 2.1 or 2.2 iPhone (both 2G and 3G) as well as a number of other goodies.                           Installer.app              Gain access to hundreds of tools that are not available in App Store for some reason and that allow you to expand the functionality of the iPhone, including our own  Kate ,  Qik ,  Snapture  and many others!                    Stay Secure              While giving access to Installer.app, Pusher is not opening the system partition of your iPhone for writing. This makes it more secure and prevents potential information theft that can be fairly easy with the ""normal"" jailbreak methods.                    SpringBoard Background             Gain the ability to set the SpringBoard background â completely free!                              Works for 2G and 3G              Pusher works for both 2G and 3G iPhones.                    Support for 2.2              In addition to newly released 2.2 firmware support, Pusher will work just as well for 2.0.2 and 2.1 iPhones! However, we recommend you to stay on the bleeding edge and give 2.2 a try - it represents many hours of hard work of Apple engineers.

Accessibility/Help Page                                               The Department of Motor Vehicles' (DMV) website has been developed in compliance  with California Government Code 11135, located in Section D of the  California Government Code. Code 11135 requires that all electronic and  information technology developed or purchased by the State of  California Government is accessible to people with disabilities. There  are various types of physical disabilities that impact user interaction  on the web. Vision loss, hearing loss, limited manual dexterity, and  cognitive disabilities are examples, with each having different means  by which to access electronic information effectively. Our goal is to  provide a good web experience for all visitors.             Below you will find a list of some of the technology solutions we  have integrated to make our websites easy to navigate, fast-loading and  accessible. To further improve the ease of use and readability of this  site, such as increasing the font size, please review the section below  on how to  customize your browser .                   Quick Links                                 Change font size               Keyboard and mouse shortcuts               Browser add-ons                 Customize your browser                                  What Makes Our Website Accessible?                                 Clean, Simple and Consistent                      Our website uses simple information architecture with uniform  navigation and reliable headings throughout. Content layout and  graphical design are consistent on every page.               ""Skip To:"" Menu                The  ""Skip to"" navigation  appears at the top of each page. It allows the user to jump to the  content area, accessibility page, or footer, and skip the navigation  and other header elements, which repeat on every page.               The Navigation                The main navigation, located just below the title banner (California logo and branding banner), uses  lists .  Lists make it easier for screen readers to literally read down the list  without having to sort through unnecessary code. Lists also allow the  users to use the tab key to move from link to link.               Breadcrumb Navigation                Breadcrumbs, located at the top of each page (except for the homepage)  and directly below the main navigation, let you know where you are and  where you have been, or where a particular file resides. Breadcrumbs  make it easier to navigate your way back to the root folder.               Images With Alternative Text                Photographs and other relevant images on the site are accompanied by  alternative text (the ALT tag.) Alt tags provide a written description  of the image, which is accessible to screen readers, and it is visible  when the mouse is placed over the image. This is also useful for people  who have images turned off on their browser, in which case a  description will display where the image used to be.               Relative Font Sizing                          Relative font size  can be enlarged using  magnification tools or by changing your browser settings .               Style Sheets                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used for content layout and graphical  elements (color, font styles, custom titles and subtitles, etc.) Using  CSS for styling keeps our HTML clean, streamlined, easier to maintain,  and it downloads faster.  Style sheets can be replaced  by the user's own styles.                                To turn CSS off, and access the content without any formatting, download and install the  Firefox Web Developer toolbar  or the  Internet Explorer Developer toolbar .  With these toolbars turning CSS on and off is just a click away, plus  they offer many other helpful tools. If you use a different browser, do  an Internet search for accessibility for your particular browser.               Fluid Sizing Display                The width of our pages changes and adapts to the width of your browser.  This is more noticeable if you have a large screen and/or use high  resolution for your monitor. Our website is viewed best at a minimum of  800 x 600 pixels.               Accessible Via Mouse or Keyboard                You can use the mouse or keyboard to navigate through our information. The  tab key  will move the cursor from link to link.               Access Keys                Access keys are keyboard shortcuts that help you get around the site.                          Use  ""Alt""  +  ""S""  to access search box                                                   No Sound, No Images, No Problem                Content is accessible without sound, color, scripts or graphics.               Improved Search Engine                         Google search  engine provides more relevant results than our previous state search application.                                        Customize Your  Browser to Fit Your Needs                                   Change font size                   In most browsers (example: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape) you could change the font size by following the steps below:                                       Open  your browser                     Click  View  button from top menu bar                     Click  Text Size                     Select your option                                     If your browser uses a different naming convention and you do not  see this path, please check the Help menu on your browser. The Help  menu is usually the last option on the top menu bar, and it can often  be accessed by pressing the keys ""Alt"" + ""H"".                   In addition, newer browser versions have a magnifying tool that lets  you zoom into a page and display all elements at 150 percent, 200  percent, etc. Look for the magnifying tool with a ""+"" character. This  icon is typically located at the bottom of your browser, on the right,  or at the top, below the standard menu tools, on the right.  Furthermore, the keyboard shortcut to access this tool is:  ""Ctrl""  +  ""Shift""  +  ""+""  to zoom in, and  ""Ctrl""  +  ""Shift""  +  ""-""  to zoom out.

Can I customize the font size, formatting, and screen colors?                         How can I improve the way IE works with my screen reader or voice recognition  software?

Copied to Pocket PC when installing project.           .ppr - Data/results management options, such as         Data Pathway settings for HTML/XML/Excel/ADO output, XML input, Data Scripting. Found on         PC or server only. If this is removed, Data settings are restored to defaults.

Found on PC and         Pocket PC.           .ppd - Session database data store, stores         actual session data.

Use the 'Task' button and menu on the Pocket PC to return    to Pocket PC Creations when it is already open.      (Note, the X control in Pocket PC programs    doesn't close a program, it puts them into background, still running.    Use the Task button to either return or close.)           "" CUSTOM POINT: PPCC.GPS ""           or similar messages with custom points when viewed on Pocket PC. The         problem is due to the custom point being installed         while Pocket PC Creations was open on the Pocket PC and/or desktop PC.  Close          Pocket PC Creations on both, and please install custom point again.Â      "" Data index unavailable "" message    during Synchronise may indicate that either the corresponding project    cannot be found or that a session for the project is still open on the    Pocket PC (Finish/close session).                     Installation to Pocket PC and desktop           PC  - The most common problems reported are related to         installation of upgrades of Pocket PC Creations to a Pocket PC, almost         invariably this is due to Pocket PC Creations not being closed on the         Pocket PC before upgrading. It is vital to  CLOSE Pocket PC Creations         on both the Pocket PC and desktop before installing upgrades . This         is sound practice for installation of any program.Â                      Windows XP         and Vista Installation  within  networks  may require administrative privileges, software cannot be         installed from a 'user' account. Log on to XP as an 'administrator'         before installing Pocket PC Creations.

clueweb09-enwp00-16-10768	"                     Adobe Reader          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search            Adobe Acrobat           Developed by   Adobe Systems       Latest release   9.0.0.332 /  25 June 2008 ; 238 days ago       OS   Cross-platform       Type   PDF  viewer and writer       License   Adobe  EULA       Website   http://www.adobe.com/acrobat       Adobe Acrobat  is a family of  computer programs  developed by  Adobe Systems , designed to view, create, manipulate and manage files in Adobe's  Portable Document Format  (PDF). [ 1 ]  Some software in the family are commercial, and some are  freeware .  Adobe Reader  (formerly Acrobat Reader) is available as a no-charge download from Adobe's web site, and allows the viewing and printing of PDF files. [ 2 ]  Acrobat and Reader are widely used as a way to present information with a fixed layout similar to a paper publication.

This in turn has led to many more competitors for Adobe Acrobat, providing both free and commercial programs that create or manipulate PDF, such as  Ghostscript ,  Foxit , and  Nitro PDF . Adobe also allows Acrobat plug-ins to be developed by third parties, which can add extra functions within the Acrobat program.     [ edit ]   Product names   Adobe has changed the names of the products in the Acrobat family regularly, also splitting-up, joining, or discontinuing products. Between version 3 and 5, Standard and Professional versions were one product simply called Adobe Acrobat.   As of July 2008 [update] , the current main members of the Adobe Acrobat family are:          Adobe Reader 9 Icon         Adobe Reader 9 (Windows & Mac only; latest for Unix is 8.1.3)   Adobe Acrobat 9 (Windows & Mac only; no Unix version)    Adobe Acrobat 9 Standard   Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro   Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended (includes Adobe Presenter)       A growing collection of free web services launched via the  Acrobat.com  service such as Adobe Buzzword, Connect Now, Create PDF, and Share.     Adobe has never created a product called either Adobe Writer or Acrobat Writer, although they used to include a  printer driver  called PDFWriter, which is unrelated.     [ edit ]   Product history   Acrobat 1.0  for Macintosh was originally released 15 June 1993, later for DOS and Windows 3.1. This was not available in single copies and was not initially free. After a while the  IRS  purchased a right to distribute Reader 1.0, effectively making it seem free to those who obtained it that way:     PDF version 1.0 supported.   Acrobat Exchange 1.0 (included PDFWriter printer driver and Acrobat Exchange application).   Acrobat Distiller 1.0. Created a PDF from PostScript (no printer driver at this stage).     Acrobat 2.0  for Windows and Macintosh was first released September 1994. It is now available free of charge [ citation needed ] :     PDF version 1.1 (and prior) supported.   Acrobat Exchange 2.0, package as 1.0.   Acrobat Professional 2.0, which included the contents of Acrobat Exchange, plus Distiller.   There were 2.1 updates.   Acrobat Catalog was introduced, using  Verity, Inc.  technology to create searchable indexes to PDF files. Searching required a special version of Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange.     Acrobat 3.0  was released November 1996. The first to display PDF files in-browser, and the first to support form filling:     PDF version 1.2 (and prior) supported.

[ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Internationalization and localization     [ edit ]   Language availability   Adobe Acrobat is available in the following languages: Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian. Arabic, Nepali, Hebrew and Greek versions available from WinSoft, [ 11 ]   Adobe Systems '  internationalization and localization  partner.     [ edit ]   Specific features for Arabic and Hebrew languages   The Arabic and Hebrew versions are specifically developed for these specific languages, which are normally written  right-to-left . These versions come with special TouchUp properties to handle digits, ligatures option and paragraph direction in right-to-left Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic, Hebrew and Farsi, as well as standard left-to-right Indian scripts such as Hindi, Sanskrit, and Gujarati. The Web Capture feature can convert single web pages or entire web sites into PDF files, while preserving the content's original text encoding. Acrobat can also copy Hebrew and Arabic text to the system  clipboard  in its original encoding; if the target application also supports the text encoding, then the text will appear in the correct script.     [ edit ]   Criticism   From Version 3.02 onwards, Acrobat Reader (now Adobe Reader) has included support for  JavaScript . This functionality allows the document creator to include code which executes when the document is read. While JavaScript is designed without direct access to the file system to make it ""safe"", vulnerabilities have been reported for abuses such as distributing malicious code through Acrobat. [ 12 ]  On September 13, 2006,  David Kierznowski  provided sample PDF files illustrating these vulnerabilities. In the most current version of Reader, JavaScript can be disabled using the preferences menu and embedded URLs that are launched are intercepted by a security warning dialog box to either allow or block the website from launching. [ 13 ]   The application has been criticized for being slow to load and use. [ 14 ]  Workaround solutions have been developed to speed up the software. [ 15 ]  The application has been improved by Adobe as the latest version of the software does load quicker; Adobe claims that Adobe Reader 7 users can ""Open and save PDF files faster than ever"" as version 7.0 launches ""up to 50% faster than version 6.0"". [ 16 ]  This works by installing a  QuickStart  program which runs every time the computer is turned on (and then quits). While it is often stated that this preloads the program into memory, using up memory resources, it actually just opens and closes each program file, allowing virus checking to take place in advance of the program actually loading [ 17 ] . Note that this QuickStart program is for Adobe Reader/Acrobat 7.0 only.   Many have also noted poor behavior in the  Internet Explorer  and  Mozilla Firefox  Acrobat plug-ins. The plug-ins do not support full asynchronous loading, thus causing browsers to appear to ""lock up"" until the document has been fully downloaded. In addition, the plug-ins apparently also fail to terminate when a document is closed, thereby leaving behind various CPU-intensive application threads that remain running until the  Windows  session is  ended [ 18 ]  and may prevent ending the Windows session.

Thanks and enjoy!                                                             This application requires Java suport.  This server also available via IRC at:   irc://irc.ircstorm.net:6667/            BASIC INSTRUCTIONS AND TIPS   -  On Your First Visit : If the Chat Room Interface will not load, you may not have JAVA installed on your computer.    If you do not have the Java plug-in required to run the chat-room interface, you can download it by right-clicking here on ""GET JAVA"" and selecting ""save target as."" This will open a window by which you can specify a location to save the file to. It is probably best to select the ""desktop."" Once the file is downloaded, simply open the file and follow the install instructions.      Download:  GET JAVA     Also, i f you are using the chat room for the first time, it may take some time to load because it may have to download a ""Conference Room Java Client"" into your computer's system. Answer yes to the window that pops up asking if you want it to be installed. Sometimes, there is no window asking your permission to install this component, and the download is done automatically. Do not be alarmed if a small window opens indicating that this file is being downloaded: http://www.freejavachat.com/java/cr.zip. The chat room requires this component to function.   - To start chatting: Â    1. Enter your first and last name in the ""Your user name:"" box   2.

This kind of event is a totally free real training session. In fact we've requested to all partecipants to bring their laptops to follow the day. In this first meeting we've talked about  Flash Media Server 3, Adobe AIR and Flex 3 .Â  Matteo and I have taken examples and demos we usually use for  Comtaste's training courses  about these topics. People were very interested and we gave the basics to stream a video content using the Flash Media Server 3 and ActionScript 3 (with Flash CS3 as well as Flex Builder 3).    In the second part of the morning we showed how to export the streaming video on AIR using flash CS3 and Aptana. Adobe Italy has supported the event offering the possibility to make a raffle for donating a  Flip Video Ultra  device (it's so coool !).    You'll find all the slides and demo example on  FlexGala  Adobe user group site.

Tribunale di Cremona has been using computer technology for quite some time,  following guidelines from the Digital Administration Code. Efficiency and speed  have inspired several projects including the conversion of documents to digital  format done in collaboration with Adobe. For the past several years, all papers  related to pre-trial conferences have been available in Adobe Portable Document  Format (PDF). Starting recently, all court papers associated with a trial are  available in digital format only.
