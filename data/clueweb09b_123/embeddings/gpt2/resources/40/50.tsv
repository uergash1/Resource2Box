It is any furniture, fixtures, tools, or equipment that is used or   available for use in a business. It includes fixed assets, but does not include   supplies (such as pens and paper) or real estate. For a more detailed list of   applicable assets, see Sections One and Two of the BPP return form.

Yes, but your request must come in writing and be faxed or postmarked by   March 2.

What is the tax rate?                                                          The current tax rate is $3.60 per $100 of assessed value (that is, 3.6% of   the value). The rate is set each year by the board of   supervisors.                                                                                                                                                   What if I went out of business?                                                            You must notify our office  in writing  that you went out of business.   If your BPP is on commercial property and is still available for use in business  after  you went out of business, you are responsible to continue to   report it until it is removed or made unavailable for use in the   business . Note that BPP is NOT   pro-rated.                                                                                                                                                   What if I purchased or recapitalized an item on January   1?                                                           Report the item on the form and use a 90% assessment factor. Include a note   on the “Total” line that these assets are included there.                                                                                                                                                    What if I am a sole proprietor and I own the equipment   personally?                                                           You must still report any tangible equipment that is used or available for   use in your business.                                                                                                                                                    What if I own no equipment?                                                           Then you must write “None” on the return and still send it in, along with an   explanation of owning no equipment. You are required to file the return no   matter how much equipment you have. If you lease equipment, then report it in   Section Three of the return. You may be asked to provide a copy   of the lease agreement.                                                                                                                                                   Do you allow for technological obsolescence?                                                          Yes, for certain computer equipment and peripherals, as described in Section   Two of the return. Computers and peripherals are assessed using a more   progressive schedule of assessment factors, found in Section Two. Please note   that “computerized” equipment is not the same as a computer or peripheral and   would usually be reported along with all other equipment (in Section One),  not  with computer equipment in Section   Two.                                                                                                                                                   What if I do not depreciate anything?                                                           You must still file the form and report all equipment used or available for   use in the business. You must include an itemized list of all equipment; and you   may be asked to provide a copy of your federal Schedule C or Form 1120 in lieu   of the required copy of your federal depreciation   schedule.                                                                                                                       What do I need to attach to my form?                                                            An itemized list of all property reported, and a copy of your most   recent federal depreciation schedule (Form 4562), if you filed one. If you did   not file a federal depreciation schedule, you may be asked to provide other   supporting documents, including federal Schedule C or Form 1120 in lieu of the   Form 4562                                                       top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Machinery and Tools (M&T) Tax                                                                                  How do you determine who is a manufacturer or   processor?                                                                   This is a determination made by the commissioner, based on a   number of facts about the process and nature of your business activities.   Taxpayers must first submit the “BCI” Form , with relevant documentation such as   photos, process flow charts, or narratives for review. In some cases a site   visit is necessary by our auditors. The nature and extent of any transformation   during your process is most important in making this determination.                                                                                                                  Can I get an extension of time to file my   return?                                                                     Yes, but your request must come in writing and be faxed or   postmarked by March 2. An extension will be granted for no longer than 60 days.                                                                                                                                                  What if I went out of business?                                                                  You must notify our office in writing that you went out of business. If your   M&T is on commercial property and is still  availabl e for use in   business  after  you went out of business, you are responsible to   continue to report it until it is removed or made unavailable for use in the   business.  Note that M&T tax is NOT   pro-rated.                                                                                                                                                                           What about idle and unused equipment?                                                                   Machinery and tools may be reported as “Idle and   Unused” if they (a) have been discontinued in use continuously for at least one   year prior to January 1, 2009 or (b) on   and after January 1, 2008, have been   specifically identified in writing by the taxpayer to the commissioner of the   revenue on or before April 1, 2008, that   the machinery and tools would be withdrawn from service before January 1,   2009, not in use on January 1, 2009, and no reasonable prospect exists that the   machinery and tools will be returned to use prior to January 1, 2010.  Construction-in-progress, occasional, and   seasonal use of machinery and tools would not constitute “idle and unused”   property.                                   A detailed list of assets itemizing all property   reported by capitalized cost and date of acquisition must be submitted with this   return.  Also, an explanation must be provided with this return if there   is a difference between the property reported on this return and your 2008 return.  This asset list should   include a separate list of assets that were idle and unused continuously for one   year prior to January 1, 2009.                                   You may also submit a specific list of machinery and   tools that you anticipate will be removed from use not later than January 1,   2010, and expect the machinery and tools   will not be used at all during 2010.  This   list must be submitted on or before April 1, 2009, for the machinery and tools to be declared   idle and unused on the 2010 machinery and   tools form.                                   Once any property identified as “idle and unused” is   returned to use, please contact our office immediately for proper reporting   guidelines.                                                               top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Enterprise Zones                                                                                              I received the rebate last year. Do I need to apply   again this year?                                                                             Yes. Each year, you must file your M&T form, pay the tax bill,   and  then  submit a new request in writing for the   rebate.                                                                                                                                 For what period of time does the qualifying M&T   receive the rebate?                                                                            Rebates are issued for  five years  throughout the   twenty-year life of the Enterprise Zone.                                                                                                                                                                     Who qualifies for the rebate?                                                                          The qualification actually is determined by asset, individually. Each year,   therefore, the M&T taxpayer must submit an asset list detailing the   acquisition and cost figures of each asset, including also a declaration of any   disposals or replacements.                                                                                                                                                                                                   What if I replace a qualifying asset before its rebate period is   over?                                                                          The rebate on qualifying replacement assets is limited to an amount equal to   the increase in M&T tax assessed on the replacement equipment over the tax   assessed on the M&T that were replaced. It is the responsibility of the   taxpayer to identify replacement assets (as opposed to plant expansions or   simple new acquisitions and separate disposals, for which the regular rules   apply).                                                                     top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Overview                         New Business Brochure -PDF                         Tangible Personal Property                                     Business License                                     Machinery & Tools                                     Enterprise Zone                                     Transient Occupancy                                     Short-Term Rental                                     Consumer Utilities                                     Consumption                                                                                                                                     Overview                         Personal Property Tax                                     Car Tax Relief                                     Assessments                                     Vehicle Updates                                     Filing Information                                     Personal Property FAQ's                                     Personal Property Forms                                     Income                                     Tax Relief                                     Consumer Utilities                                     Consumption                                     Real Estate Data                                                                                            Business FAQ's                              Property Tax FAQ's                                                                                                                                  Customer Service Standards                        Newsletter                      Spanish/Para Espal                        Contact Us                                                                                                              Can't find what you need?

This publication describes the environmental impacts of BOD,    how it is distributed in septic systems, and remediation strategies for    excess BOD.              Septic System    Additives  (HENV-13-W)    There are many products advertised as essentials for improving or    repairing septic systems. This publication examines types of additives    and the available scientific data regarding their effectiveness.              Seasonally    High Water Tables and Septic Systems    (HENV-12-W)    In late winter and spring, seasonally high water tables can reduce a    septic system's ability to treat wastewater. This publication explains    why these high water tables occur and examines septic system designs    used in areas where they occur.              Obtaining a    Septic System Permit  (HENV-11-W)    Before a new septic system can be installed or repairs can be made to    existing systems, Indiana rules require obtaining permits from a    homeowner's county health department. This publication describes how    homeowners can obtain these permits.              Septic Systems    in Flooded and Wet Soil Conditions  (HENV-10-W)    During flooding, saturated soils can prevent septic systems from    functioning properly and could lead to contaminated drinking water. This    publication offers homeowners specific suggestions they can follow    before, during, and after flooding to protect their water supply,    health, and septic system.      a class=""link"" href=""http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/HENV/HENV-9-W.pdf"">    Water Use and    Septic System Performance  (HENV-9-W)     This publication suggests plumbing and behavioral changes that can    reduce water consumption. Such changes can save homeowners money,    improve septic system performance, and reduce the risk for hydraulic    overload or other kinds of septic system failure.            b>  Gravel and Gravelless    Trench Soil Absorption Fields   (HENV 8-W)    In recent years, substitutes for traditional gravel trenches in septic    system soil absorption fields have become available. This publication    examines the strengths and weaknesses of these new technologies.              Indiana    Soils and Septic Systems  (HENV-7-W)    Soil is the most valuable component of an Indiana septic system. This    publication describes the soil characteristics that are necessary for    effective wastewater treatment.              Grandfathered Septic    Systems: Location and Replacement/Repair      (HENV-6-W)    This publication is aimed at owners of older homes or those thinking of    buying an older home. It provides suggestions on how to locate an    existing septic system and describes current Indiana rules regarding    septic system failures.              Septic    Tanks: The Primary Treatment Device of Your Septic System     (HENV-5-W)    Septic tanks play an essential role in treating wastewater in areas    without municipal sewage treatment, but tanks are just one part of the    septic system. This publication discusses the purpose and types of    septic tanks, and how to maintain them.              Septic System Distribution    Boxes: Importance of Equal Distribution in Trenches      (HENV-4-W)    Indiana septic systems frequently rely on distribution boxes to evenly    distribute wastewater effluent to soil absorption field trenches. This    publication explains how these distribution boxes work and how they can    be maintained to avoid costly repairs.              Turfgrass    Color: Indicator of Septic System Performance      (HENV-3-W)    Homeowners often notice color differences in the turfgrass over their    septic system soil absorption fields. This publication examines how    those color differences can be an early sign that troubles are about to    occur.                  Increasing the    Longevity of Your Septic System   (HENV-2-W)    Many new homeowners do not expect to pay several thousand dollars to    repair failing septic systems; however, many homeowners are faced with    this dilemma due to improper septic system maintenance. This publication    explains how a septic system functions and provides maintenance    instructions in order to increase a system lifespan.              Septic System Failure     (HENV-1- W)    This publication discusses various types of septic system failure, their    associated environmental impacts, and common causes of failure.               Local Septic  Management  Homeowner Checklist       Things to Keep In  Mind:     !    Inspect your system at least once every 3 years and pump your tank  at that time.     !    Use water efficiently     !    Don dispose of household hazardous wastes in sinks and toilets     !    Plant only grass over and near your septic system. Roots from  nearby trees or shrubs might clog and damage the drainfield.     !    Don drive or park vehicles on any part of your septic system.  Doing so can compact the soil in your drainfield or damage the pipes, tank, or    other septic system components.           System Design     There are two components of on-site system design: soil evaluation  and actual design. Soil evaluation consists of noting where your property lines  may be so that test holes can be dug. These holes will locate your soil  absorption system, which handles the fluid part of septic wastes. This step may  include actually digging the test holes with a backhoe, augering the soil or  performing a soil examination.     You can find a well-qualified consulting soil scientist who will do  soil and landscape evaluations for on-site wastewater disposal systems or for  other purposes. The registered soil scientists have the technical credentials  required by state law (Indiana Code 25-31.5) and have agreed to follow a Code of  Professional Conduct which states that they hold paramount the health and  welfare of the public and the protection of soil and water quality. To find a  soil scientist visit     http://www.isco.purdue.edu/irss/obtaining_services.html  or to  obtaining printed copies of the Roster - There is an additional cost to have  IRSS mail you a printed copy; contact the IRSS office at (765) 494-1492 for cost  information.      Questions to ask Prior to Choosing a Soil Evaluator         Will you provide a written estimate for all   phases of the proposed work?

As more people move into rural areas, the need for proper sewage disposal becomes increasingly important in order to protect the health of the public, of the environment and of our drinking water supplies.  The permit process assures that septic systems are designed, installed and operated according to current codes.  This helps meet community health needs, and provides the owner with a septic system that meets their needs.   The installation, repair, or replacement of any portion of a septic system (septic tank, drainfield and related components) requires a permit issued by the Environmental Health Division of the Clallam County Department of Community Development.   How to Obtain a Septic Permit    Contact a licensed Septic System   Designer  to begin the process.   Your designer will contact the Environmental Health Division to schedule soils/site evaluation with the Environmental Health Specialist.  (Note: This is a built-in step in the septic construction permit process.  It can also be done separately if you do not plan to build within the next three years.  Please see section on  Site Registrations .)   The designer will submit plans, construction permit application and  fees  to the Environmental Health Division.  With some types of systems, an  O&M Agreement  will also be required.  The Environmental Health Specialist will review the application and may visit the site again.  If corrections are needed, the application will be returned to the designer.   An approved permit is given to the designer, who will send it to you along with the approved plans.  A construction permit expires three years from the date it is issued.     Installing the Septic System After the septic permit is approved, the system should be installed by a certified  Septic System   Installer .   Exception:   Homeowners may install their own system if they are the owner and resident of the property, and install only one system per calendar year.  This still requires a design by a licensed designer and County approval and inspection.  Homeowners must follow design specifications.  If the system is installed incorrectly, it will not be approved and may need to be re-installed - which can cost thousands of dollars.   Both the Designer and the Environmental Health Division must be notified when installation begins.  The designer needs to inspect the system at various stages of construction and before final cover in order for the system to receive final approval.   Using the Septic System When the system has been installed, inspected, and approved, it is ready for use.  Remember that it needs continued  maintenance  and regular pumping in order to work properly.  The Environmental Health Division permits septic system  pumpers .  For some systems, an Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Agreement is needed.   Repairing a Septic System A repair may replace all or part of a failing septic system.  No reserve area is required for a repair permit, though it is still highly recommended.   The fee is less than  a new or expansion permit, and a repair permit expires six months after it is issued.   Community Septic Systems A community septic system serves more than one home, on one or more lots.  A community system may serve a duplex, or an entire subdivision (hundreds of homes).  For larger systems, the developer usually has the system designed, permitted, and the drainfield installed (but not the septic tanks).  A homeowner may need to get a septic tank placement permit, and have their tank installed and connected to the system when they build their home.   Commercial Septic Systems Commercial systems often have to accommodate either a very low flow, such as a small office, or a very high output, such as a shopping center.  Generally, commercial systems have stronger waste than residential septic systems.  This often requires special treatment of the sewage.  The design may be different, but the permit process is essentially the same as for residential systems.   What if I only want to know if my site/soils can support a Septic System? Property owners and prospective purchasers should understand a site's capabilities or limitations.  The Soil Conservation Service has soils maps of the county which describe the soil types and how well suited each one is for sewage disposal system.  These maps are not exact enough to rule out the need for a site specific evaluation.  This is accomplished through a  Site Registration .  This is a built-in step in the septic construction permit process, but it can also be done separately, even prior to purchasing, with the landowner's permission.   How large an area will I need for the drainfield? The size of the drainfield depends on the soil type and the number of bedrooms in your home.  The shape depends on soil depth and topography.  The drainfield area maybe as small as 10 x 40 feet or as large as 50 x 100 feet.  New systems also require a reserve area that is the same size as the initial drainfield.  This reserve area is in case the system fails and the drainfield needs to be replaced.   What if I live inside the City limits? The Environmental Health Division is responsible for permitting all septic systems in Clallam County.  There are some areas within the city limits of Port Angeles, Sequim and Forks that do not have sewer hook-ups and are served by on-site sewage systems.  If you have a septic system and the City sewer is extended to serve your area, you typically do not need to hook-up to the sewer unless your septic system fails.  Please  contact  Environmental Health or your City utility department for more information about your individual situation.

It is required that you  have a septic permit  before  you can get a building permit. To obtain a  septic permit you will need to have a site evaluation performed by an  Environmental Health specialist to determine the type of septic system you need  to install. The cost for this evaluation is $350.00. The paperwork for this process  is available at the Environmental Health office.     After the site evaluation is complete, you will submit a septic system design  application, along with the appropriate fee, to the Environmental Health office.  Homeowners planning to design and install their own septic system are allowed to  design and install only gravity flow systems. This process requires an  additional fee of $165. All other types of septic systems must be done by a  licensed installer.     A license is required for all septic system installers and designers wanting  to contract work in Kittitas County. These licenses are available through the  Environmental Health office.     A license is required of all septic tank pumpers contracting work in Kittitas  County. These licenses are available through the Environmental Health office.   Inspections   Licensed designer or installers,  request an inspection online .

Levels of Septic System Inspection and Testing   Anyone inspecting septic systems MUST be familiar with the hazards and safety concerns discussed at  SAFETY WARNINGS       LEVEL-0 Septic Inspections - Basic Visual, Loading & Dye Test - Home Inspection Procedures      This level of inspection is typically provided during a ""home inspection"" for real estate transactions.            A VISUAL ONLY Septic System Inspection Includes:  Basic visual inspection and reporting of information (Performed by   home inspector or other expert) (Some municipalities require this test be   performed only by specifically licensed septic contractors or engineers.) Notice that the photo demonstrates that an astute septic system inspector can detect evidence of failure from site conditions alone in some instances.              A    VISUAL PLUS LOADING DYE TEST Septic System Inspection Includes:  - Visual + Dye test and system loading. Warning: using an inadequate amount of   tracer dye or an insufficient volume of water for this test will make it meaningless. Therefore ordering a   ""stand-alone"" septic loading and dye test of a system should be expected to cost considerably more than   such a test which can be performed overlapped in time with other Building inspection services. Beware of   quick, minimal tests which place only a small volume of liquid into the system (perhaps 50 gallons over 10 or 15 minutes).          The minimum quantities of water and septic dye needed are discussed in a separate chapter at  Septic Loading and Dye Test Procedure Details  -   a chapter of ""Inspecting, Testing, & Maintaining Residential Septic Systems"".     ADDITIONAL LEVELS OF INSPECTION for real estate transactions and for problem   diagnosis and bidding prior to actual repair work.     Level 1 Septic System Inspections - Visual, Open Covers, Inspect Equipment, Loading & Dye Test          A Level 1 Septic System Inspection is comprised of the following:           The steps in a  Level 0 inspection  which we described above                 Additional visual inspection steps to open accessible covers & inspect equipment.                  Septic Dye Test : This inspection usually include a septic     loading and dye test. If a dye test is to be performed it must be done before the system is pumped or     further inspected - otherwise the loading test cannot test the absorption system.                  Septic Tank Pumping: In some states such as Pennsylvania, a Level-1 Septic Inspection may include requiring tank pump out and     inspection.               A level 1 Septic Inspection can be performed by a home inspector or other expert. Some municipalities  require this test be performed only by specifically licensed septic contractors  or engineers. This is the Pennsylvania PSMA definition for level-1.    If septic tank pumping is required, such as in PA, the inspector should be present before, during, and after tank pumping in order to observe important indications of septic system condition such as damaged or missing baffles, baffle overrun, abnormal septic tank levels, or backflow into the septic tank during pumpout.    Also see our  Inspecting, Testing, & Maintaining & Designing Residential Septic Systems - Septic Systems Online Book    Level 2 Septic System Inspection Includes - Visual, Open, D-Box, Pump & Inspect Septic Tank        A Level-2 Septic System Inspection is comprised of:        The steps in a   Level 0 septic system inspection  and               The steps in a  Level 1 septic system inspection  and also              Septic Tank and D-boxes:  The following additional steps to:          Inspect the septic tank : locate, excavate if needed, open, inspect the septic tank      Determine the septic system capacity & tank conditions , scum thickness, baffle condition, etc.       Pump and inspect the emptied septic tank  and septic tank baffles      Distribution Boxes : locate, excavated if needed, and inspect the distribution boxes                       A level-2 septic inspection is performed by   septic pumping contractor since tank pumping is needed, or another septic expert may order the tank pumping and should be on-site to inspect the conditions described above             Some municipalities require this   test be performed only by specifically licensed septic contractors or   engineers.       Because a Level-2 septic inspection requires septic tank pumping, the inspector should be present before, during, and after tank pumping in order to observe important indications of septic system condition such as damaged or missing baffles, baffle overrun, abnormal septic tank levels, or backflow into the septic tank during pumpout.    Also see our  Inspecting, Testing, & Maintaining & Designing Residential Septic Systems - Septic Systems Online Book      Level 3 Septic System Inspection Includes - visual, open, pump, soil percolation, site engineering        A Level-3 Septic System Inspection is comprised of:           The steps in a  Level 0 septic system inspection  and               The steps in a  Level 1 septic system inspection  and              The steps in a  Level 2 septic system inspection  and also              Drainfield or Leachfield Evaluation & Soil Conditions:  Additional site excavation to make test openings in leaching area, other test holes to observe soil conditions, test the soil percolation rate, and if needed,    perform other engineering work necessary to certify an existing system or to permit    specification of system replacement.                    Performed   by septic pumping contractor, engineer, or other expert.              Some municipalities   require this test be performed only by specifically licensed septic contractors   or engineers.     Also see our  Inspecting, Testing, & Maintaining & Designing Residential Septic Systems - Septic Systems Online Book    Procedures for Inspecting Septic Systems      We discuss the requirements for different levels of inspections (level 0, 1, 2 septic inspections) at:   Septic System Inspection Types & Inspection Levels      Field worksheets for various types of septic system inspections can be found at  Checklists for Inspecting, Testing, & Maintaining Residential Septic Systems     See  Septic Tank Inspection Procedure   for details of inspecting septic tanks themselves and a septic tank inspection checklist.

Septic System Videos Describe How to Find the Septic Tank, Drainfield, and Septic Pumping Station       Septic 101 part 1: Video on How to find the septic system .  (How to Find the Septic Tank) Daniel thinks out loud while walking an 18 year old homesite in northern Minnesota while      searching for the septic system and its components. Simple visual observations tell us where the septic tank and fields might be, where they are unlikely to be, and where they certainly would not be expected to be found. We find the septic tank, its cleanout port, and we see an      electrical box which means that a septic pump installed. We begin discussing what kind of septic system is likely to be installed at a lakefront homesite.      Septic 101 part 2: Video on Where could a Septic Drainfield Possibly be Located?  (How to Find the Septic Drainfield) Daniel continues commenting about the meaning of site observations as we follow the site back to where the drainfield might or might not be.      Septic 101 part 3: Video on Deciding  the Septic Drainfield Location.  (Deciding the Probable Drainfield Location by Visual Inspection) Based simply on visual site observations and the age of the home, we conclude the almost-certain location of the septic drainfield for this lakefront property. (The property owner later confirmed that we were correct.)     Septic 101 part 4: Video on Why the Septic Drainfield is Not in the Front Yard .  (Noticing where we would  not  expect a septic tank or drainfield to be located) Daniel explains why, even though it looks like a good area, the septic drainfield would not be installed in the front yard of this home.

clueweb09-en0002-47-17484	"                     Programmer          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other uses, see  Programmer (disambiguation) .   A  programmer  is someone who writes  computer software . The term  computer programmer  can refer to a specialist in one area of computer programming or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. One who practices or professes a formal approach to programming may also be known as a programmer analyst. A programmer's primary computer language ( Lisp ,  Java ,  Delphi ,  C++ , etc.) is often prefixed to the above titles, and those who work in a web environment often prefix their titles with  web . A programmer is not a  software developer ,  software engineer ,  computer scientist , or  software analyst . These  professions  typically refer to individuals possessing programming skills as well as other  software engineering  skills. For this reason, the term  programmer  is sometimes considered an insulting or derogatory oversimplification of these other professions. This has sparked much debate amongst developers, analysts, computer scientists, programmers, and outsiders who continue to be puzzled at the subtle differences in these occupations. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]   Those proficient in computer programming skills may become  famous , though this regard is normally limited to software engineering circles. Many of the most notable programmers are often labeled  hackers . Programmers often have or project an image of  individualist   geekdom , resistance to ""suits"" (referring to both  business suits  literally and figuratively to the ""Establishment""), controls and conformity.   Ada Lovelace  is popularly credited as history's first programmer. She was the first to express an  algorithm  intended for implementation on a  computer ,  Charles Babbage 's  analytical engine , in October 1842. [ 6 ]  Her work never ran, though that of  Konrad Zuse  did in 1941. The  ENIAC  programming team, consisting of  Kay McNulty ,  Betty Jennings ,  Betty Snyder ,  Marlyn Wescoff ,  Fran Bilas  and  Ruth Lichterman  were the first working programmers. [ 7 ] [ 8 ]   International Programmers' Day is celebrated annually on January 7th. [ 9 ]           Contents       1   Nature of the work     1.1   Testing and debugging   1.2   Application versus system programming   1.3   Types of software       2   Globalization of Programming     2.1   Market Changes in the USA       3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Nature of the work     Some of this section is from the  Occupational Outlook Handbook , 200607 Edition, which is in the  public domain  as a  work of the United States Government .     Computer programmers write, test, debug, and maintain the detailed instructions, called  computer programs , that computers must follow to perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming  advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools  have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.   Programmers work in many settings, including corporate  information technology  departments, big software companies, and small service firms. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client' sites as  contractors .  Licensing  is not typically required to work as a programmer, although  professional certifications  are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a  profession  (although some authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).   Programmers' work varies widely depending on the type of business they are writing programs for. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Although simple programs can be written in a few hours, programs that use complex mathematical formulas whose solutions can only be approximated or that draw data from many existing systems may require more than a year of work. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmers supervision.   Programmers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers and by systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many  programming languages . Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program.  COBOL , for example, is commonly used for business applications which are run on  mainframe  and  midrange  computers, whereas  Fortran  is used in science and engineering.  C++  is widely used for both scientific and business applications.  Java ,  C#  and  PHP  are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as  Java programmers , or by the type of function they perform or environment in which they work: for example,  database  programmers ,  mainframe programmers , or  Web developers .   When making changes to the  source code  that programs are made up of, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by inserting comments in the source code so that others can understand the program more easily. To save work, programmers often use  libraries  of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps.     [ edit ]   Testing and debugging   Programmers test a program by running it and looking for bugs. As they are identified, the programmer usually makes the appropriate corrections, then rechecks the program until an acceptably low level and severity of bugs remain. This process is called  testing  and  debugging . These are important parts of every programmer's job. Programmers may continue to fix these problems throughout the life of a program. Updating, repairing, modifying, and expanding existing programs sometimes called  maintenance programmer . Programmers may contribute to  user guides  and  online help , or they may work with  technical writers  to do such work.   Certain scenarios or execution paths may be difficult to test, in which case the programmer may elect to test by inspection which involves a human inspecting the code on the relevant execution path, perhaps hand executing the code. Test by inspection is also sometimes used as a euphemism for inadequate testing. It may be difficult to properly assess whether the term is being used euphemistically.     [ edit ]   Application versus system programming   Computer programmers often are grouped into two broad types: application programmers and systems programmers. Application programmers write programs to handle a specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from  independent software vendors . Systems programmers, in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as  operating systems  and  database management systems . These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and  CPU  of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as  printers  and  disk drives . Because of their knowledge of the entire computer system, systems programmers often help applications programmers debug, or determine the source of, problems that may occur with their  programs .     [ edit ]   Types of software   Programmers in software development companies may work directly with experts from various fields to create software  either programs designed for specific clients or packaged software for general use  ranging from  computer and video games  to educational software to programs for  desktop publishing  and financial planning. Programming of packaged software constitutes one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer services industry.   In some organizations, particularly small ones, workers commonly known as  programmer analysts  are responsible for both the systems analysis and the actual programming work. The transition from a mainframe environment to one that is based primarily on personal computers (PCs) has blurred the once rigid distinction between the programmer and the user. Increasingly, adept end users are taking over many of the tasks previously performed by programmers. For example, the growing use of packaged software, such as spreadsheet and database management software packages, allows users to write simple programs to access data and perform calculations.   In addition, the rise of the Internet has made  Web development  a huge part of the programming field. More and more software applications nowadays are  Web applications  that can be used by anyone with a  Web browser . Examples of such applications include the  Google  search service, the  Hotmail  e-mail service, and the  Flickr  photo-sharing service.     [ edit ]   Globalization of Programming             The examples and perspective in this article  deal primarily with the  United States  and do not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .         [ edit ]   Market Changes in the USA   Computer programming,  offshore outsourcing , and  Foreign Worker Visas  became a controversial topic after the crash of the  dot com bubble  left many programmers without work or with lower wages. Programming was even mentioned in the 2004 U.S. Presidential debate on the topic of  offshore outsourcing .   Large companies claim there is a  skills shortage  with regard to programming talent. However, U.S. programmers and unions counter that large companies are exaggerating their case in order to obtain cheaper programmers from developing countries and to avoid paying for training in very specific technologies. Objective studies on this debate that both sides accept have been hard to come by and a distrust has formed between large companies and programming trade groups.   Enrollment in computer-related degrees in U.S. has dropped recently due to lack of general interests in science and mathematics and also out of an apparent fear that programming will be subject to the same pressures as manufacturing and agriculture careers. This situation has resulted in confusion about whether the U.S. economy is entering a ""post-information age"" and the nature of U.S.  comparative advantages . Technology and software jobs were supposed to be the replacement for factory and agriculture jobs lost to cheaper foreign labor, but if those are subject to free trade losses, then the nature of the next generation of replacement careers is not clear at this point.   A parallel trend that has made it harder for some programmers to find work in the United States is the ongoing  professionalization  of computer programming. As software quality has steadily increased in successive years, the knowledge and experience required to produce such software has also increased, particularly as new programming languages,  software project management  techniques, and  application frameworks  have been introduced. Programmers who lack an understanding of these new technologies will naturally encounter decreasing demand for their services.   Professionalization is a particularly relevant force in the United States, as startup companies in particular often outsource the development of an initial application draft to an outside contractor (including overseas companies), and then hire a skilled in-house programmer in the United States to refine the initial product.

American Owned        For close to a century, the Euclid Chemical Company has served the global building market as a worldwide quality supplier of specialty products and technical support services for the concrete and masonry construction industry.

Along with superior products, the Euclid Chemical Company provides a wide range of technical support services including research and development, seminars and training programs, and design and installation consultation for contractors, architects, engineers and owners.               The Euclid Chemical Company is a business group comprised of 4 core units, Euclid USA, Euclid Canada, EUCOMEX and EUCO-TOXEMENT, and numerous joint venture and licensee relationships with partners throughout Latin America, the Asian Pacific and Middle East.  Operating within the Tremco Group, Euclid Chemical Company is wholly owned by RPM International Inc., a $3.3 billion,  public corporation located in Medina, Ohio. The Euclid Chemical Group is proud to be American owned and American made, supplying the highest quality products and services to the global building community.                History:  A Family Tradition Of Customer First                For over 90 years, the Euclid Chemical Company has supplied specialty products and support services to the concrete and masonry construction industry.  Throughout this long history, the company has maintained the cultural foundation of family ownership and built a reputation of leadership on the basis of superior products and services delivered as promised.               Established in 1910 as the Klein Building Products Company, pioneer Jacob Klein developed and distributed waterproofing and concrete additive products in the local Cleveland market.  Over the next three decades, the Euclid Chemical Company and ""Euco Method"" became known as the industry standard.  Klein partnered with his cousin, Lawrence Korach, and by the mid 1940's the company was marketing eight products on a regional basis under the Euclid Chemical Company, EUCO brand name.  The cousins continued to grow the company jointly until 1951 when Larry purchased 100% interest, becoming sole owner and president.                        By 1960, the company had grown nine-fold and relocated into a new headquarter and operating facility.  Mr. Korach expanded the product line to over 60 concrete and masonry construction products and set up a transportation system to launch the distribution of EUCO products into the national market.  Lawrence Korach retired as president with the sale of the Euclid Chemical Company to RPM International Inc. in 1984 but continued to assist the company in a consultative role.           RPM named Jeff to succeed his father as president of the Euclid Chemical Company in 1984.  As president, Jeff Korach continued to propel Euclid's growth and expansion, increasing the product line to include over 150 standard products.  Under his leadership, the company developed the domestic and international sales force and pushed the distribution of EUCO products into the global marketplace.  In 1997, RPM named Mr. Jeffrey Korach, president of RPM'S wholly owned subsidiary, Tremco, Inc.           Kenneth Korach, son of founder, Larry Korach, has been president of the Euclid Chemical Company since 1997.  Ken's leadership has moved the company into its current strategic position.  His directive has brought the quality system under certification by the International Organization for Standards and updated the company's electronic technology to current standards. Ken recently directed the acquisition of Euclid's joint venture companies in Canada, Mexico and Colombia. Ken's vision continues to shape the family goal for the Euclid Chemical Company, to be a world leader and satisfy every customer.    Today, Euclid Chemical manufacturers and distributes over 200 specialty products as well as supporting services to the concrete and masonry construction market.          Marketing And National Accounts:  Technical Support Teams        The Euclid Chemical Company is both a product and service provider.

While there have been several mobile data advancements the past decade, few have created as much buzz in the industry or held as much promise as mesh networking. That being said, many do not have a clear understanding of mesh networking and its true value to public safety. The best place to start is with a basic definition of mesh networking. In its simplest form, mesh networking is a wireless communications technology that allows each radio to function as a router, meaning data can be sent to or through any other radio in the network in order to reach the intended destination. In other words, radios communicate on a peer-to-peer level. This results in adaptive, flexible connections among users that would not be possible with traditional communication technologies. The ""mesh"" in mesh networking both refers to the overall shape of the network's communication paths as well as to its decentralized nature. The latter is really the key to mesh networking's distinctive performance characteristics and why mesh networking solutions are so important for public safety applications. Unlike other mobile data solutions that resemble a hub-and-spoke or cellular architecture, mesh networks do not rely on centralized controllers to guide network traffic. The mobile clients in these traditional wireless solutions are highly dependent on stationary infrastructure to keep them operational. If a controller fails, the entire system is compromised. Remove the hub, and the spokes are meaningless. In the arena of public safety, that type of failure spells disaster. These liabilities with traditional communications have driven many to adopt mesh networks for mobile data access. With mesh networking, the system is not limited by a single point of failure. Even if an individual radio, or node, in the network fails, the network remains operational. The network is, quite literally, ad hoc because it can instantly reform or ""heal"" itself. Mobile mesh networks, or ""mobile ad hoc networks,"" have extraordinary flexibility and adaptive capabilities, and trace their history to late 1970s military communications applications that required the utmost in mobility and reliability. Current mobile mesh networking solutions have retained the peer-to-peer and ""on the fly"" nature that was characteristic of earlier generations. They have the ability to organically reform based on conditions in the field, whether that means a node drops out temporarily or permanently, or the network topology changes. The differences in mesh There are, in fact, vast differences within the mesh networking product landscape. The tendency for some is to take certain known qualities and limitations of popular mesh networking solutions and apply those to the entire product category. It's like painting with a broad stroke when more detail is required. There are mesh networks and then there are mobile mesh networks. Solutions that are considered mobile mesh networks offer peer-to-peer communications at the client (vehicle) level, meaning each client radio in the field is a node in the mesh network. Fixed mesh networks in public safety feature mesh on the infrastructure side of the network, meaning the radio towers are meshed together but the clients are not. Of course, there are innumerous variations to these two general categories including some hybrids of both. Generally speaking though, mobile mesh networks offer some decided advantages including ad hoc radio coverage extension and greater network survivability. If infrastructure is damaged, destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable, data communications can continue in mobile mesh networks. Second, not all mesh networks are based on Wi-Fi or derivatives of the technology. The benefits of this ubiquitous technology standard are well-known; Wi-Fi offers easy access, high data rates and low costs. However, Wi-Fi suffers from a short communication range, security holes and mobility constraints, so it's far from ideal for first responder data communications. There's a rule of thumb to remember: The higher the frequency band of the radio, the higher the throughput but the shorter the range. Conversely, the lower the frequency band, the lower the throughput and the longer the range. This leads to the question, ""What's considered high and what's considered low?"" For the purposes of this discussion, 1 GHz will be the boundary between the two. Generally speaking, higher throughput allows for greater flexibility in the application of the technology. An example of which is the ability to stream video from a police car, which cannot be accomplished without a significant data pipeline. This capability is tempered by the reality that with that data pipe comes a much smaller radio coverage area, so substantially more infrastructure is required. This can mean 20 or more access points per square mile. This is simply not practical or affordable for the majority of law enforcement agencies — or all public safety agencies for that matter — especially those in local municipalities, small- to mid-size towns and counties. Though fewer lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions are available, those that are deserve a good look. These solutions offer a much wider communication range that is usually measured in miles instead of feet. The data rates are lower than what higher frequency mesh offers, but still much higher than most private radio systems (i.e. RD-LAP) and in line with cellular data access speeds. A vast majority of law enforcement applications, including computer-aided dispatch, records management systems, e-mail, automatic vehicle locationing (AVL) and criminal database access, are supported by lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions. Couple this with the fact that lower frequency alternatives need fewer than 10 percent of the access point density of Wi-Fi-based higher frequency mesh networking solutions, and it's easy to see the value proposition of these alternatives. Unfortunately, this kind of information has not been readily available to most public safety agencies. Some feel they are not able to leverage the advantages that mesh networking is capable of delivering based on price alone. Instead, they pass in favor of land mobile radio systems or cellular data networks with lower initial investments but substantial recurring fees. For those who have eschewed mesh networking in the past, perhaps it's time to give it another look. Choosing the right system — mesh or not — requires that each agency completely understand their unique needs and requirements. So, how does any agency begin the process of evaluating its needs and matching them to the solutions on the market? Very deliberately. Choosing a mobile data solution Too often public safety officials make choices concerning mobile data solutions before they have fully identified their needs and defined their true requirements. Sometimes they make choices based on ethereal needs rather than thinking about long-term issues. Surveys have shown that public safety officials expect their solutions to last for at least 10 years. Certainly, 10 years is a long time and it may seem difficult, if not impossible, to project the types of applications the agency will be using in three years, let alone five or 10. The point is, think long term and practical. If 10 years seems a bit of a stretch, then project out to seven years. For example, will officers require the ability to submit reports via a records management system and accomplish such tasks as downloading evidence photos, mugshots and other images? Is Internet access desirable? What about AVL? What changes are anticipated in the agency's service area? Is the population growing? How will the agency change to accommodate this growth? How many units are in the field now, and how is this expected to change over the next five to 10 years? What is the terrain of the service area? Does the agency serve a primarily urban area with high-density residential and commercial structures, or is the service area suburban or rural? Is the area relatively flat, hilly or mountainous? Finally, what is the budget? Does the agency have separate budgets for equipment, maintenance and ongoing monthly expenses if necessary? Agencies, regardless of size, should seek input from a variety of experts, which must include the officers that will be using the new system. There is no better way of capturing all of the important features and requirements of the new system than by speaking with those who will be working with it daily. Approach the process objectively. Capture input in writing when possible. Be sure to talk with other agencies and, if possible, visit mobile data installations to see how the solution actually operates in the field. All of this will build the foundation for choosing the solution that best suits the agency and avoid a poor decision the agency will have to live with for many years. Five decision points To make the right choice when choosing a networking solution, public safety agencies must understand important differences — not only among the solutions themselves, but also about the infrastructure they require to remain operational. Focus on these five critical decision points: Cost, and the length of time needed to achieve a return on investment.  There are significant cost differences among various mesh networking solutions, and even greater differences when it comes to realizing a return on investment (ROI). Some solutions enable the purchaser to achieve an ROI in as little as two or three years; other solutions will take much longer. This is why each agency should establish a budget up front and manage expectations to that budget. Recognize that the initial capital outlay and ongoing expenses for a mesh network are different from other wireless solutions. At the same time, there are significant cost differences even among various mesh network vendors. Cost differences can be categorized three ways: acquisition costs, ongoing expenses, and deployment and training expenses. Acquisition costs include the initial outlay for the equipment and related infrastructure. All mesh networking systems require an initial outlay of cash, plus capital costs if additional computers, towers and other capital equipment are needed. When evaluating different solutions, agencies need to determine which are compatible with existing computer systems and software. In this category, agencies also should consider whether the solution is scalable. It is a good thing the system will grow with the agency's needs, but these costs will have to be budgeted at some point in the future. Ongoing expenses include monthly access fees or licensing fees. These are frequently overlooked. Agencies that choose to deploy a cellular network or trunked radio, for example, are not only dealing with the initial acquisition costs but also monthly charges that can total $80 or more per unit and may escalate in the years ahead. Alternatively, mesh networks have minimal ongoing expenses. Once the initial capital outlay is made, the agency owns the system outright and, depending on the frequency band, access or licensing fees may not apply. Determine the costs for deployment and training. Calculate the installation and deployment costs from a system integrator as part of the overall acquisition costs. At the same time, how will training be handled? Will the system integrator take care of this as part of the contract, or will it need to come straight from the vendor? Durability and reliability is crucial.  When evaluating solutions and vendors, consider the durability of the equipment as well as the infrastructure. Compare the systems side-by-side and, based on personal experience and that of actual customers, try to assess each system's susceptibility to outages during natural and man-made disasters. What redundancies are built into the solution? Can the system operate vehicle-to-vehicle if infrastructure is lost? How will the respective downtimes for each system impact operations, and the safety and security of the public? How rapidly can the system recover and reform itself? What is the reputation and focus of each vendor?  Be sure to perform due diligence to ensure those vendors on the short list are experienced, reputable and likely to be in business for a while. Some key metrics in this category include: Length of time in business. Is the company a relative newcomer, or has it been in the business for more than 10 years? What is its history? Is it engaged in both research and development? Is it a proven innovator and market leader? Does the company's technology benefit from continual cross-pollination with military projects, often the source for innovation in the commercial field? How large is the company, and how does its size affect responsiveness and agility? Are the company's other customers of similar size, or much larger or smaller? What about service after the sale? How do current customers rate the tech support and service functions? How does the data rate and range of each product under consideration meet the agency's requirements? How does each solution support the data applications currently in use, along with other applications like computer-aided dispatch, records management, e-mail and instant messaging, GPS positioning, database lookups, and image and file transfer? What is the range of each solution? How will it perform given the unique topographic features of the service area? What about each system's security features?  Certain technologies are much more susceptible to hacking and intrusion. What safeguards, such as proprietary waveforms, encryption and user filtering, do the solutions offer? Due diligence will make the case Choosing the right mobile data solution for a particular application can seem like a daunting task. There are many choices in the market and more within the mesh networking segment than most realize. The key to avoiding the pitfalls and making the right decision is performing due diligence, both within the public safety agency and with prospective vendors. A thorough review of agency needs and requirements, followed by an analysis of how those needs stack up against the product offerings, will help ensure the ultimate choice is one that will serve the agency's needs many years into the future.

While there have been several mobile data advancements the past decade, few have created as much buzz in the industry or held as much promise as mesh networking. That being said, many do not have a clear understanding of mesh networking and its true value to public safety. The best place to start is with a basic definition of mesh networking. In its simplest form, mesh networking is a wireless communications technology that allows each radio to function as a router, meaning data can be sent to or through any other radio in the network in order to reach the intended destination. In other words, radios communicate on a peer-to-peer level. This results in adaptive, flexible connections among users that would not be possible with traditional communication technologies. The ""mesh"" in mesh networking both refers to the overall shape of the network's communication paths as well as to its decentralized nature. The latter is really the key to mesh networking's distinctive performance characteristics and why mesh networking solutions are so important for public safety applications. Unlike other mobile data solutions that resemble a hub-and-spoke or cellular architecture, mesh networks do not rely on centralized controllers to guide network traffic. The mobile clients in these traditional wireless solutions are highly dependent on stationary infrastructure to keep them operational. If a controller fails, the entire system is compromised. Remove the hub, and the spokes are meaningless. In the arena of public safety, that type of failure spells disaster. These liabilities with traditional communications have driven many to adopt mesh networks for mobile data access. With mesh networking, the system is not limited by a single point of failure. Even if an individual radio, or node, in the network fails, the network remains operational. The network is, quite literally, ad hoc because it can instantly reform or ""heal"" itself. Mobile mesh networks, or ""mobile ad hoc networks,"" have extraordinary flexibility and adaptive capabilities, and trace their history to late 1970s military communications applications that required the utmost in mobility and reliability. Current mobile mesh networking solutions have retained the peer-to-peer and ""on the fly"" nature that was characteristic of earlier generations. They have the ability to organically reform based on conditions in the field, whether that means a node drops out temporarily or permanently, or the network topology changes. The differences in mesh There are, in fact, vast differences within the mesh networking product landscape. The tendency for some is to take certain known qualities and limitations of popular mesh networking solutions and apply those to the entire product category. It's like painting with a broad stroke when more detail is required. There are mesh networks and then there are mobile mesh networks. Solutions that are considered mobile mesh networks offer peer-to-peer communications at the client (vehicle) level, meaning each client radio in the field is a node in the mesh network. Fixed mesh networks in public safety feature mesh on the infrastructure side of the network, meaning the radio towers are meshed together but the clients are not. Of course, there are innumerous variations to these two general categories including some hybrids of both. Generally speaking though, mobile mesh networks offer some decided advantages including ad hoc radio coverage extension and greater network survivability. If infrastructure is damaged, destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable, data communications can continue in mobile mesh networks. Second, not all mesh networks are based on Wi-Fi or derivatives of the technology. The benefits of this ubiquitous technology standard are well-known; Wi-Fi offers easy access, high data rates and low costs. However, Wi-Fi suffers from a short communication range, security holes and mobility constraints, so it's far from ideal for first responder data communications. There's a rule of thumb to remember: The higher the frequency band of the radio, the higher the throughput but the shorter the range. Conversely, the lower the frequency band, the lower the throughput and the longer the range. This leads to the question, ""What's considered high and what's considered low?"" For the purposes of this discussion, 1 GHz will be the boundary between the two. Generally speaking, higher throughput allows for greater flexibility in the application of the technology. An example of which is the ability to stream video from a police car, which cannot be accomplished without a significant data pipeline. This capability is tempered by the reality that with that data pipe comes a much smaller radio coverage area, so substantially more infrastructure is required. This can mean 20 or more access points per square mile. This is simply not practical or affordable for the majority of law enforcement agencies — or all public safety agencies for that matter — especially those in local municipalities, small- to mid-size towns and counties. Though fewer lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions are available, those that are deserve a good look. These solutions offer a much wider communication range that is usually measured in miles instead of feet. The data rates are lower than what higher frequency mesh offers, but still much higher than most private radio systems (i.e. RD-LAP) and in line with cellular data access speeds. A vast majority of law enforcement applications, including computer-aided dispatch, records management systems, e-mail, automatic vehicle locationing (AVL) and criminal database access, are supported by lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions. Couple this with the fact that lower frequency alternatives need fewer than 10 percent of the access point density of Wi-Fi-based higher frequency mesh networking solutions, and it's easy to see the value proposition of these alternatives. Unfortunately, this kind of information has not been readily available to most public safety agencies. Some feel they are not able to leverage the advantages that mesh networking is capable of delivering based on price alone. Instead, they pass in favor of land mobile radio systems or cellular data networks with lower initial investments but substantial recurring fees. For those who have eschewed mesh networking in the past, perhaps it's time to give it another look. Choosing the right system — mesh or not — requires that each agency completely understand their unique needs and requirements. So, how does any agency begin the process of evaluating its needs and matching them to the solutions on the market? Very deliberately. Choosing a mobile data solution Too often public safety officials make choices concerning mobile data solutions before they have fully identified their needs and defined their true requirements. Sometimes they make choices based on ethereal needs rather than thinking about long-term issues. Surveys have shown that public safety officials expect their solutions to last for at least 10 years. Certainly, 10 years is a long time and it may seem difficult, if not impossible, to project the types of applications the agency will be using in three years, let alone five or 10. The point is, think long term and practical. If 10 years seems a bit of a stretch, then project out to seven years. For example, will officers require the ability to submit reports via a records management system and accomplish such tasks as downloading evidence photos, mugshots and other images? Is Internet access desirable? What about AVL? What changes are anticipated in the agency's service area? Is the population growing? How will the agency change to accommodate this growth? How many units are in the field now, and how is this expected to change over the next five to 10 years? What is the terrain of the service area? Does the agency serve a primarily urban area with high-density residential and commercial structures, or is the service area suburban or rural? Is the area relatively flat, hilly or mountainous? Finally, what is the budget? Does the agency have separate budgets for equipment, maintenance and ongoing monthly expenses if necessary? Agencies, regardless of size, should seek input from a variety of experts, which must include the officers that will be using the new system. There is no better way of capturing all of the important features and requirements of the new system than by speaking with those who will be working with it daily. Approach the process objectively. Capture input in writing when possible. Be sure to talk with other agencies and, if possible, visit mobile data installations to see how the solution actually operates in the field. All of this will build the foundation for choosing the solution that best suits the agency and avoid a poor decision the agency will have to live with for many years. Five decision points To make the right choice when choosing a networking solution, public safety agencies must understand important differences — not only among the solutions themselves, but also about the infrastructure they require to remain operational. Focus on these five critical decision points: Cost, and the length of time needed to achieve a return on investment.  There are significant cost differences among various mesh networking solutions, and even greater differences when it comes to realizing a return on investment (ROI). Some solutions enable the purchaser to achieve an ROI in as little as two or three years; other solutions will take much longer. This is why each agency should establish a budget up front and manage expectations to that budget. Recognize that the initial capital outlay and ongoing expenses for a mesh network are different from other wireless solutions. At the same time, there are significant cost differences even among various mesh network vendors. Cost differences can be categorized three ways: acquisition costs, ongoing expenses, and deployment and training expenses. Acquisition costs include the initial outlay for the equipment and related infrastructure. All mesh networking systems require an initial outlay of cash, plus capital costs if additional computers, towers and other capital equipment are needed. When evaluating different solutions, agencies need to determine which are compatible with existing computer systems and software. In this category, agencies also should consider whether the solution is scalable. It is a good thing the system will grow with the agency's needs, but these costs will have to be budgeted at some point in the future. Ongoing expenses include monthly access fees or licensing fees. These are frequently overlooked. Agencies that choose to deploy a cellular network or trunked radio, for example, are not only dealing with the initial acquisition costs but also monthly charges that can total $80 or more per unit and may escalate in the years ahead. Alternatively, mesh networks have minimal ongoing expenses. Once the initial capital outlay is made, the agency owns the system outright and, depending on the frequency band, access or licensing fees may not apply. Determine the costs for deployment and training. Calculate the installation and deployment costs from a system integrator as part of the overall acquisition costs. At the same time, how will training be handled? Will the system integrator take care of this as part of the contract, or will it need to come straight from the vendor? Durability and reliability is crucial.  When evaluating solutions and vendors, consider the durability of the equipment as well as the infrastructure. Compare the systems side-by-side and, based on personal experience and that of actual customers, try to assess each system's susceptibility to outages during natural and man-made disasters. What redundancies are built into the solution? Can the system operate vehicle-to-vehicle if infrastructure is lost? How will the respective downtimes for each system impact operations, and the safety and security of the public? How rapidly can the system recover and reform itself? What is the reputation and focus of each vendor?  Be sure to perform due diligence to ensure those vendors on the short list are experienced, reputable and likely to be in business for a while. Some key metrics in this category include: Length of time in business. Is the company a relative newcomer, or has it been in the business for more than 10 years? What is its history? Is it engaged in both research and development? Is it a proven innovator and market leader? Does the company's technology benefit from continual cross-pollination with military projects, often the source for innovation in the commercial field? How large is the company, and how does its size affect responsiveness and agility? Are the company's other customers of similar size, or much larger or smaller? What about service after the sale? How do current customers rate the tech support and service functions? How does the data rate and range of each product under consideration meet the agency's requirements? How does each solution support the data applications currently in use, along with other applications like computer-aided dispatch, records management, e-mail and instant messaging, GPS positioning, database lookups, and image and file transfer? What is the range of each solution? How will it perform given the unique topographic features of the service area? What about each system's security features?  Certain technologies are much more susceptible to hacking and intrusion. What safeguards, such as proprietary waveforms, encryption and user filtering, do the solutions offer? Due diligence will make the case Choosing the right mobile data solution for a particular application can seem like a daunting task. There are many choices in the market and more within the mesh networking segment than most realize. The key to avoiding the pitfalls and making the right decision is performing due diligence, both within the public safety agency and with prospective vendors. A thorough review of agency needs and requirements, followed by an analysis of how those needs stack up against the product offerings, will help ensure the ultimate choice is one that will serve the agency's needs many years into the future.

While there have been several mobile data advancements the past decade, few have created as much buzz in the industry or held as much promise as mesh networking. That being said, many do not have a clear understanding of mesh networking and its true value to public safety. The best place to start is with a basic definition of mesh networking. In its simplest form, mesh networking is a wireless communications technology that allows each radio to function as a router, meaning data can be sent to or through any other radio in the network in order to reach the intended destination. In other words, radios communicate on a peer-to-peer level. This results in adaptive, flexible connections among users that would not be possible with traditional communication technologies. The ""mesh"" in mesh networking both refers to the overall shape of the network's communication paths as well as to its decentralized nature. The latter is really the key to mesh networking's distinctive performance characteristics and why mesh networking solutions are so important for public safety applications. Unlike other mobile data solutions that resemble a hub-and-spoke or cellular architecture, mesh networks do not rely on centralized controllers to guide network traffic. The mobile clients in these traditional wireless solutions are highly dependent on stationary infrastructure to keep them operational. If a controller fails, the entire system is compromised. Remove the hub, and the spokes are meaningless. In the arena of public safety, that type of failure spells disaster. These liabilities with traditional communications have driven many to adopt mesh networks for mobile data access. With mesh networking, the system is not limited by a single point of failure. Even if an individual radio, or node, in the network fails, the network remains operational. The network is, quite literally, ad hoc because it can instantly reform or ""heal"" itself. Mobile mesh networks, or ""mobile ad hoc networks,"" have extraordinary flexibility and adaptive capabilities, and trace their history to late 1970s military communications applications that required the utmost in mobility and reliability. Current mobile mesh networking solutions have retained the peer-to-peer and ""on the fly"" nature that was characteristic of earlier generations. They have the ability to organically reform based on conditions in the field, whether that means a node drops out temporarily or permanently, or the network topology changes. The differences in mesh There are, in fact, vast differences within the mesh networking product landscape. The tendency for some is to take certain known qualities and limitations of popular mesh networking solutions and apply those to the entire product category. It's like painting with a broad stroke when more detail is required. There are mesh networks and then there are mobile mesh networks. Solutions that are considered mobile mesh networks offer peer-to-peer communications at the client (vehicle) level, meaning each client radio in the field is a node in the mesh network. Fixed mesh networks in public safety feature mesh on the infrastructure side of the network, meaning the radio towers are meshed together but the clients are not. Of course, there are innumerous variations to these two general categories including some hybrids of both. Generally speaking though, mobile mesh networks offer some decided advantages including ad hoc radio coverage extension and greater network survivability. If infrastructure is damaged, destroyed or otherwise rendered inoperable, data communications can continue in mobile mesh networks. Second, not all mesh networks are based on Wi-Fi or derivatives of the technology. The benefits of this ubiquitous technology standard are well-known; Wi-Fi offers easy access, high data rates and low costs. However, Wi-Fi suffers from a short communication range, security holes and mobility constraints, so it's far from ideal for first responder data communications. There's a rule of thumb to remember: The higher the frequency band of the radio, the higher the throughput but the shorter the range. Conversely, the lower the frequency band, the lower the throughput and the longer the range. This leads to the question, ""What's considered high and what's considered low?"" For the purposes of this discussion, 1 GHz will be the boundary between the two. Generally speaking, higher throughput allows for greater flexibility in the application of the technology. An example of which is the ability to stream video from a police car, which cannot be accomplished without a significant data pipeline. This capability is tempered by the reality that with that data pipe comes a much smaller radio coverage area, so substantially more infrastructure is required. This can mean 20 or more access points per square mile. This is simply not practical or affordable for the majority of law enforcement agencies — or all public safety agencies for that matter — especially those in local municipalities, small- to mid-size towns and counties. Though fewer lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions are available, those that are deserve a good look. These solutions offer a much wider communication range that is usually measured in miles instead of feet. The data rates are lower than what higher frequency mesh offers, but still much higher than most private radio systems (i.e. RD-LAP) and in line with cellular data access speeds. A vast majority of law enforcement applications, including computer-aided dispatch, records management systems, e-mail, automatic vehicle locationing (AVL) and criminal database access, are supported by lower frequency band mobile mesh solutions. Couple this with the fact that lower frequency alternatives need fewer than 10 percent of the access point density of Wi-Fi-based higher frequency mesh networking solutions, and it's easy to see the value proposition of these alternatives. Unfortunately, this kind of information has not been readily available to most public safety agencies. Some feel they are not able to leverage the advantages that mesh networking is capable of delivering based on price alone. Instead, they pass in favor of land mobile radio systems or cellular data networks with lower initial investments but substantial recurring fees. For those who have eschewed mesh networking in the past, perhaps it's time to give it another look. Choosing the right system — mesh or not — requires that each agency completely understand their unique needs and requirements. So, how does any agency begin the process of evaluating its needs and matching them to the solutions on the market? Very deliberately. Choosing a mobile data solution Too often public safety officials make choices concerning mobile data solutions before they have fully identified their needs and defined their true requirements. Sometimes they make choices based on ethereal needs rather than thinking about long-term issues. Surveys have shown that public safety officials expect their solutions to last for at least 10 years. Certainly, 10 years is a long time and it may seem difficult, if not impossible, to project the types of applications the agency will be using in three years, let alone five or 10. The point is, think long term and practical. If 10 years seems a bit of a stretch, then project out to seven years. For example, will officers require the ability to submit reports via a records management system and accomplish such tasks as downloading evidence photos, mugshots and other images? Is Internet access desirable? What about AVL? What changes are anticipated in the agency's service area? Is the population growing? How will the agency change to accommodate this growth? How many units are in the field now, and how is this expected to change over the next five to 10 years? What is the terrain of the service area? Does the agency serve a primarily urban area with high-density residential and commercial structures, or is the service area suburban or rural? Is the area relatively flat, hilly or mountainous? Finally, what is the budget? Does the agency have separate budgets for equipment, maintenance and ongoing monthly expenses if necessary? Agencies, regardless of size, should seek input from a variety of experts, which must include the officers that will be using the new system. There is no better way of capturing all of the important features and requirements of the new system than by speaking with those who will be working with it daily. Approach the process objectively. Capture input in writing when possible. Be sure to talk with other agencies and, if possible, visit mobile data installations to see how the solution actually operates in the field. All of this will build the foundation for choosing the solution that best suits the agency and avoid a poor decision the agency will have to live with for many years. Five decision points To make the right choice when choosing a networking solution, public safety agencies must understand important differences — not only among the solutions themselves, but also about the infrastructure they require to remain operational. Focus on these five critical decision points: Cost, and the length of time needed to achieve a return on investment.  There are significant cost differences among various mesh networking solutions, and even greater differences when it comes to realizing a return on investment (ROI). Some solutions enable the purchaser to achieve an ROI in as little as two or three years; other solutions will take much longer. This is why each agency should establish a budget up front and manage expectations to that budget. Recognize that the initial capital outlay and ongoing expenses for a mesh network are different from other wireless solutions. At the same time, there are significant cost differences even among various mesh network vendors. Cost differences can be categorized three ways: acquisition costs, ongoing expenses, and deployment and training expenses. Acquisition costs include the initial outlay for the equipment and related infrastructure. All mesh networking systems require an initial outlay of cash, plus capital costs if additional computers, towers and other capital equipment are needed. When evaluating different solutions, agencies need to determine which are compatible with existing computer systems and software. In this category, agencies also should consider whether the solution is scalable. It is a good thing the system will grow with the agency's needs, but these costs will have to be budgeted at some point in the future. Ongoing expenses include monthly access fees or licensing fees. These are frequently overlooked. Agencies that choose to deploy a cellular network or trunked radio, for example, are not only dealing with the initial acquisition costs but also monthly charges that can total $80 or more per unit and may escalate in the years ahead. Alternatively, mesh networks have minimal ongoing expenses. Once the initial capital outlay is made, the agency owns the system outright and, depending on the frequency band, access or licensing fees may not apply. Determine the costs for deployment and training. Calculate the installation and deployment costs from a system integrator as part of the overall acquisition costs. At the same time, how will training be handled? Will the system integrator take care of this as part of the contract, or will it need to come straight from the vendor? Durability and reliability is crucial.  When evaluating solutions and vendors, consider the durability of the equipment as well as the infrastructure. Compare the systems side-by-side and, based on personal experience and that of actual customers, try to assess each system's susceptibility to outages during natural and man-made disasters. What redundancies are built into the solution? Can the system operate vehicle-to-vehicle if infrastructure is lost? How will the respective downtimes for each system impact operations, and the safety and security of the public? How rapidly can the system recover and reform itself? What is the reputation and focus of each vendor?  Be sure to perform due diligence to ensure those vendors on the short list are experienced, reputable and likely to be in business for a while. Some key metrics in this category include: Length of time in business. Is the company a relative newcomer, or has it been in the business for more than 10 years? What is its history? Is it engaged in both research and development? Is it a proven innovator and market leader? Does the company's technology benefit from continual cross-pollination with military projects, often the source for innovation in the commercial field? How large is the company, and how does its size affect responsiveness and agility? Are the company's other customers of similar size, or much larger or smaller? What about service after the sale? How do current customers rate the tech support and service functions? How does the data rate and range of each product under consideration meet the agency's requirements? How does each solution support the data applications currently in use, along with other applications like computer-aided dispatch, records management, e-mail and instant messaging, GPS positioning, database lookups, and image and file transfer? What is the range of each solution? How will it perform given the unique topographic features of the service area? What about each system's security features?  Certain technologies are much more susceptible to hacking and intrusion. What safeguards, such as proprietary waveforms, encryption and user filtering, do the solutions offer? Due diligence will make the case Choosing the right mobile data solution for a particular application can seem like a daunting task. There are many choices in the market and more within the mesh networking segment than most realize. The key to avoiding the pitfalls and making the right decision is performing due diligence, both within the public safety agency and with prospective vendors. A thorough review of agency needs and requirements, followed by an analysis of how those needs stack up against the product offerings, will help ensure the ultimate choice is one that will serve the agency's needs many years into the future.

Most analysts carry out sampling and analysis of bulk and air              samples. Some laboratories holding supervisory licences will employ              analysts in a supervisory role in asbestos removal. More generally              however, the analysts role has been developing and growing in importance              over the years. Most recently Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006              increased the involvement of the analyst in site clearance procedures.                            The analyst is responsible for completing site clearance certification              for the work area, and for issuing a certificate of reoccupation.              In addition, some clients may request greater participation in the              asbestos removal work, including pre clearance inspections and surveys,              and site management and monitoring, eg overseeing the smoke test and              carrying out some reassurance air sampling during the course of the              contract.                             Although not a legal requirement, it is desirable that the analyst              is employed by the building owner or occupier for site clearance certification.              This arrangement avoids any conflict of interest (perceived or real)              that may arise during the clearance process.

I did have a few questions                            about the Perc-Rite systems.                              First, so far as basic questions go, how would you explain the difference                            between drip emitter systems and conventional systems to someone who's not familiar with either?                              Second, how have they worked out so far? Have homeowner/developer experiences                            been generally good? Are there any specific issues that homeowners need to be aware of before installing them?                              Do they truly make  undevelopable land  developable? Have you worked with any developers who have used the system to do that? If so, how has it worked out (and if                            you can perhaps put me in touch with any of them, I would really appreciate it!)?                              Let me know what you think. Thanks so much!                              Beth                                                             Answer from Don Wolf:                              Beth,   It was my pleasure responding to your inquiry.                             As to the difference between conventional systems and drip emitter systems, conventional systems use passive technology to                            transpire waste water (effluent... see Septic 101) into the absorption area.  Drip emitter systems use active means to                            do the work. They pump the effluent into the ground in the absorption areas.   Drip emitter systems have been around                            for about twenty years.  They were developed in Israel as a means of reclaiming desert areas using fresh water to provide                            consistent distribution to water these areas evenly.  Waste water drip systems used this even distribution method to                            keep the discharge below surface for proper treatment.  We have several communities in the Atlanta, Georgia area that                            were able to be developed because of this technology. We even have a POTW (Publicly Owned Treatment Works) plant in Cherokee                            and Forsyth Counties, Georgia using this technology to dispose of their out flows in an environmentally safe manner.   Issues                            that confront homeowners with these systems are fairly basic.  System service requirements are about the same as but                            are a bit more critical than conventional systems.   The areas that have been able to be developed through use                            of these systems are on public record at most of our County Environmental Health offices throughout Georgia, Virginia, North                            and South Carolinas, Texas, and other States.   Don Wolf, DAD's Septic and Well Service www.DadsSeptic.Net     Resulting Article:  http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/septic-system-advances-aid-development-51143.aspx                                                                                    The Drip-Emitter System is used when the  conventional gravity system  cannot be used due to poor absorption rates, proximity to subsurface restrictive layers or high water tables.                                                             These systems force the waste water into the soil using pressure!                                                              For more information, please contact Dad's today!

Althouse, Carl H. Turnquist, Alfred F. Bracciano. About $60. new and available at $20. or less, used.   This is the first of two key books I used in classes attended to learn to install and service air conditioning equipment and to repair other refrigeration equipment.    It has been a standard, popular, clear, and thorough text since its original version in 1968, and here has been updated to current methods and materials for air conditioning inspection, diagnosis, and repair. It's a big, thorough text useful for people who are serious about learning refrigeration and air conditioning systems. It may seem like overkill for a homeowner who wants to read up on his or her failing air conditioner, but since there are inexpensive used copies available from Amazon, I recommend this text for those readers too.   As a student's text the only criticism I have of this book is shared by some other reviewers, one of whom points out that the ""test questions"" at the end of chapters are not well coordinated with the actual text.   Quoting from Amazon:   Textbook introducing the principles of air conditioning and refrigeration. Contains all of the most recent technology and EPA rules, with a standard coding scheme and maximized readability. Provides a base of information for students in this field and serves as a guide and reference for experienced technicians. Previous edition: c1996. DLC: Refrigeration and refrigerating machinery.             Principles of Refrigeration , (Hardcover) C. Thomas Olivo, 556 pages, Delmar Publishers; 3 Sub edition (March 1990) ISBN-10: 0827335571 ISBN-13: 978-0827335578, About $16.00 with less costly used version available.   This is the latest version of the second of two key books.    I used the 1979 version (still available used for about $4.00, but a bit obsolete) in classes attended to learn to install and service air conditioning equipment and to repair other refrigeration equipment. My earlier version was put together by R. Warren Marsh and C. Thomas Olivo. This is a smaller and still more accessible book useful for diagnosing and repairing air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. It still provides basic theory but has nice sketches of individual components, what they do, and how they are replaced.

About $26.00 with less costly used version available. ISBN-10: 1930044062 ISBN-13: 978-1930044067   This book is less theory and more ""how to fix-it"" for air conditioning equipment.     Quoting from Amazon:   Book Description: In today's ever changing technical world, service technicians must be highly skilled and have a solid understanding of refrigeration and air conditioning concepts. In addition, technicians must stay abreast of current industry development and improved techniques. Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems gives service technicians all the information needed to accurately diagnose and solve various systems problems. The book details a variety of topics and troubleshooting procedures, including the following: Refrigerant pressures, states, and conditions, Subcooling and superheat, Compression systems, Metering devices, System charge, Diagnosing air conditioning systems, Systematic troubleshooting, Alternative refrigerants, Refrigerant blends an oils, Leak detection - evacuation and clean up procedures, Ozone depletion and global warming.   Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems discusses the changes affecting the refrigeration and air conditioning industries with an emphasis on the phaseout of CFC and HCFC refrigerants. Detailed sections on the most current leak detection and evacuation methods are included, as well as a section on alternative refrigerants and retrofit guidelines. The book also includes refrigerant changeover guidelines for the following conversions: R-12 to R-134a; R-12 to R-401A; R-12 to R-401B; R-502 to R-402A/R-408A; and R-502 to R-404A/R-507.   Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems is a 251 page soft cover that is written in easy to understand language and utilizes a large number of illustrations, tables, and photos. This book will provide service technicians with the practical, hands on information needed to successfully troubleshoot and service today's increasingly complex air conditioning and refrigeration systems.   From the Publisher: Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems helps students develop an ability to troubleshoot systems and solve problems in an efficient and timely manner. Although some textbooks address the subject, the coverage is more often cursory than detailed. Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems is a textbook that thoroughly covers the subject in an easy to understand format and is an excellent addition to any curriculum               Principles of Refrigeration , 5th ed., (Hardcover), Roy J. Dossat & Thomas J. Horan, Lists for about $120. and available used at around $80.,  at the top of my technical content list for refrigeration references and text books, but also topping the price list, this is the authoritative text (cited in 10 other texts), an updated edition of the textbook for college level courses in refrigeration. The book provides a comprehensive, applications-oriented treatment of the mechanical refrigeration cycle and associated equipment.  Quoting from Amazon:   In understanding the refrigeration cycle, Roy Dossat had 25 years in the field before teaching at the University of Houston. I was fortunate to attend the course taught by him in the 70's. It showed the man had much to offer even to the less experienced technician who needed to start on the basics. This book is easy to understand and a nice read for those who need answers to the complicated use of refrigerant and applications that drive the business. Refrigerant application is in constant change as environmental demands alter our lives.

Quoting from one of several glowing Amazon.com reviews:   Proper housing ventilation, the kind that helps maintain healthyindoor air quality (IAQ)is a poorly understood subject. John Bower's book is an excellent ""teacher"" for the layperson as well as a ""continuing educational seminar"" for the industry insider. It breaks down the concept of proper ventilation in an easy-to-read format while it presents a new paradign for industry workers familiar with installing ductwork but who may not have time to keep current with trade magazines. This book illuminates aspects of proper ventilation that are often overlooked such as how pollutants get into your house in the first place and provides workable guidlines to achieve solutions. It would be ridiculous to assume that any book would have the concrete answers to every possible IAQ problem, but where this book succeeds is in its ability to involove the reader in the solution to his or her own home's individual IAQ problems.

""NOT KNOWING the basics of electricity can get you into a lot of trouble-painful trouble..."" (more) Key Phrases: cutoff panel, acorn clamp, insulated hot wires, Ohm's Law, Ideal Industries, The Art of Grounding and more.   Nice reviews:  From Library Journal: Electricity is one of the least understood yet most important aspects of do-it-yourself building and renovation. Used safely, it allows us to enjoy a life of convenience, but when its basic rules are violated it can destroy one's home. A master electrician, building inspector, and licensed general contractor, Cauldwell shows how to properly use electricity in this revision of his 1996 text. Starting with electricity's basics, he then explains tools of all types, shows how and where electricity enters the house, and explains grounding (which is vital for safety). Proceeding through the house, Cauldwell demonstrates how to wire both new construction and renovations and to install receptacles, switches, fixtures, and wired-in appliances. Important safety information is provided, including ground-fault circuit interrupters, lightning, and surge protection. Finally, Cauldwell gives instructions for wiring ""Above Code,"" his system of wiring that exceeds the minimum standards required by the electrical code and results in a safer, higher-quality installation. This title does an outstanding job of explaining an area of perennial confusion for do-it-yourselfers. Recommended for every collection. Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.  Midwest Book Review: Master electrician Cauldwell has been wiring houses for almost thirty years and is in a fine position to explain the job. From avoiding the wrong materials to designing new wiring and working with old, Wiring a House focuses on safety and long-term durability alike, telling how to work with both new and old construction. An invaluable guide. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.              Safe Home Wiring Projects ,  (Paperback) by Rex Cauldwell (Author). ""When working with electricity, knowledge is the key to safety-ignorance literally hurts.""    Amazon.com: The primary intimidating factor in working with electricity (and the thing that frightens many people away from even trying to do home wiring projects) is, obviously, the fact that it can be dangerous--even deadly--if not done properly and if appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Rex Cauldwell has put together one of the most comprehensive, basic, step-by-step guides on the subject. It is clearly organized, well referenced, and includes everything you need to know to do home wiring projects safely and correctly the first time.   From Library Journal Electricity is a mysterious (and somewhat scary) subject for most people, even those who complete many of their own repairs. Not so for Cauldwell, a master electrician with over 20 years' experience, who shows how the average do-it-yourselfer can safely perform many tasks usually reserved for electricians. He starts by explaining basic electrical principles and shows which tools to use. A section on inspecting your home's electrical system is particularly helpful, describing various hazards and pitfalls. Other sections cover repairing wiring switches and receptacles and installing light fixtures, ceiling and bathroom fans, and home entertainment systems. Profusely illustrated, safety-oriented, and including sections on troubleshooting and a glossary, this is an excellent title for beginners. Recommended for all public libraries.?Jonathan N.
