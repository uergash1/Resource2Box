By Eliana M. Hassen Corporate America finally got the memo -  Diversity  is a tool that can help build a stronger, more competitive and forward thinking company. So now, with guns blazing, diversity recruiting has become a major business initiative, often left in the lap of HR to figure out. I hate to tell you, but diversity recruiting is not the job of a recruiter; it's the job of every employee! Diversity recruiting  is not a task. It is a process that, if mastered, becomes an art. With the growing demand of talent, finding diverse employees is more difficult than ever. The key to successful diversity recruiting is to build a program that is embedded in the corporate culture. This will quickly make it everyone's job. So where do you start? How do you build a program? How do you embed diversity recruiting into the overall company culture and make it everyone's job? There are specific steps that an organization can take to jump-start their overall diversity recruitment initiatives. In recent years, companies have been hiring Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) that report directly to the CEOs to ensure that aggressive diversity initiatives are met. Having dedicated resources to cultural diversity is a step that should not be missed by any organization. Your company may not need a CDO, but there should be a team that is dedicated to diversity recruiting. Five steps to build a diversity recruitment process, making it everyone's job! Step 1 - Build an internal team.  This should consist of recruitment or HR professionals and business unit participants. The more people throughout the organization that are involved, the more exposure diversity recruitment gets. There are many advantages to building this team, including a constant line of communication with the business units regarding cultural diversity challenges and initiatives. Senior level managers should also be targeted to join the team. This will help solidify the overall culture and drive the diversity recruiting initiative into their various groups. This not only strengthens diversity in the corporate culture, but it quickly engages different employees on different levels - creating an area of development or interest for many. Different people on the team can have various roles. Some can serve as a board and drive the initiatives. Others can participate in marketing to candidates and even interact with candidates, relating the corporate diversity goals to potential new employees. The key is getting as many people involved in the process as possible. Step 2 - Define the corporate goal for diversity recruitment and then brand it.  Diversity recruitment - like every major initiative in a company - should have a communication strategy outlining its audience, purpose and desired results. Everyone in the organization should have access to this information. Educating the organization on cultural diversity is a big part of that. Don't take it for granted that everyone in the organization understands diversity. Diversity is defined to include groups beyond race and gender; now it addresses age, disability, sexual orientation, religion and language as well. Getting everyone educated and in sync with the diversity recruitment goals can be as simple as featuring information in the company newsletter, receiving a memo from an executive, or featuring the message in a section of the intranet. Step 3 - Talent acquisition marketing is the next step.  Diversity recruitment should be strategic, targeted and measured for results. Often, a company doesn't follow basic business principals in recruitment that they would in other business areas. If a campaign were being launched for a new product marketing research, analysis, and development would be required. Then strategic and tactical outlines are created: how to market, define the audience and how to measure the results. This process will yield the best results in diversity recruitment, as well. I encourage you to define the goals for the various diversity areas and then create a targeted marketing plan to recruit those groups. Then, identify what the audience reads and how it searches for employment. An even bigger part of this is the ability to write compelling ads and optimize technology. Use the Internet and word of mouth to make the path from diverse candidates to your organization clear as the sound of a bell. (This should be a big hint to invite members of your marketing organization to be a part of the diversity recruitment team!) Step 4 - Employee Referral Programs (ERP) have proven to be invaluable in many organizations around the globe - use them to drive diversity!  Create different incentive plans or programs around diversity recruitment in your existing ERPs. This turns every employee into a diversity recruiter for the company. Employees should not only understand the diversity initiatives around recruitment, but also participate in them. Regular information, with goals, metrics and new initiatives should be communicated on a regular basis to every employee. Step 5 - The final step to creating a concrete diversity recruitment process is to build a diversity employee development program.  It may seem like a function outside of recruitment or talent acquisition, but it isn't. The reality is that everything drives recruitment and talent to an organization. What better way to attract top diverse talent than to have a proven track record of your success in developing and retaining them? Creating a development plan to ensure that diverse talent is equally distributed in different business areas and growing within the company creates a buzz. It also stands behind your overall commitment to diversity. Work with your career planning folks, find volunteer mentors, define job stretch and opportunity for the diverse employees you have now - and watch the reaction through word of mouth. It will impact the bottom-line. In summary and succinctly put, the five building blocks to create a diversity recruitment program for your company: • Build a team dedicated to diversity recruiting. • Define your diversity recruitment initiatives and brand them internally. • Focus talent acquisition marketing. • Create diversity referral programs. • Develop and retain the diverse employees you have through a special development plan just for them. Recruiting diverse candidates is everyone's job and you must give everyone the tools they need to do it.

With the forced retirement of Merrill Lynch CEO E. Stanley O’Neal, the ranks of African-American top gun Fortune 500 company CEOs was sliced from six to five. O’Neal’s fall had nothing to do with race, but rather questionable investments that caused the company’s stock to plunge, and supposedly being a loner type in a corporate culture that thrives on “good old boy” insider networking. But the demise of O’Neal, for whatever reason, still raises fresh questions about how committed many corporations are to making  diversity  a reality in their boardrooms and in management. The answer varies widely from corporation to corporation. Fifty companies appear on Fortune Magazine’s list of corporations with the best track record for cultural diversity. Minorities made up almost 21 percent of their boardrooms in 2003, compared with 11 percent two years earlier. The figures almost certainly have edged up even more since then. But for every one of the 50 corporations that makes diversity more than a buzz word, there are dozens more that pat themselves on the back for having one Latino, Asian or African American on their board, or for hiring a handful in lower-level management positions. In recent years, some of America's biggest and best-known corporations that have been widely praised as having a good track record on minority hiring and promotions have been plastered with discrimination lawsuits. Texaco, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Toyota have been thrust into the legal hot seat and have made costly settlements or signed consent decrees with the EEOC. Forty years after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that forbade workplace discrimination and Executive Order 11246, signed by Lyndon Johnson in 1965, that prodded firms to promote management diversity, many companies still practice their own subtle brand of workplace apartheid. Despite the well-publicized rise of O’Neal and other black executives at AOL-Time Warner, American Express and Aetna, black CEOs are still a rarity at most of the Fortune 1000 corporations. The overwhelming majority of senior managers at these companies are white males, and as is evident from the rash of management discrimination lawsuits, women and minority managers are still paid less on average than their white, male counterparts. They are still just as likely to be pigeonholed in departments such as head of “special markets” or “minority affairs.” An embarrassing and highly publicized corporate discrimination case may bring the issue onto the public radar, but then it’s back to business as usual. That business, more often than not, is discrimination. It takes place quietly and far out of public view. The worst offending corporations employ a variety of tactics to mask discrimination. They issue glowing press releases, brochures, assorted handouts and annual stockholder reports loaded with pictures of smiling women and minority employees that tout their commitment to diversity. With much public fanfare, they establish  minority and women hiring  and training programs. The refusal of many companies to make cultural diversity the watchword in middle and upper management is bad enough, but even worse is the relentlessly hostile environment that many companies create and maintain toward minorities. Since 1990, the number of complaints of racial disrimination toward employees has climbed. Black and Latino employees have been poked with sticks, called racial slurs, have had pictures of burning crosses and white sheets placed near their lockers, have discovered the initials KKK carved on tables and benches, and even found nooses hanging at or near their desks. Most CEOs are not hypocrites when they say that they work hard to hire and promote more minorities and women. But the degree of real commitment to cultural diversity hinges on the commitment of a corporation’s top CEO and its board. When CEOs implement an outreach program that includes a diversity task force, aggressive recruiters, and a mentoring program aimed at moving talented female and minority employees up the corporate career ladder, cultural diversity will be readily apparent in the company’s hires and promotions. O’Neal’s departure was disappointing, given the still relative paucity of minority and women Fortune 500 CEO leaders. But even if O’Neal had stayed in good grace with Merrill, and had a long shelf life there, the challenge to corporate laggards on diversity wouldn’t change. And that is, don’t just preach it – practice it. About the Author New America Media Associate Editor Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

This sea change has happened without fanfare and almost without notice. In most organizations, the word inclusion has been added to all the company's diversity materials with no explanation. This article is a short account of why this shift has happened and what it means. Probably the most widely-read article on cultural diversity in organizations was Roosevelt Thomas's ""From Affirmative Action to Affirming Diversity,"" which appeared in the Harvard Business Review in 1990. Diversity, said Thomas, was no longer about complying with a legal mandate but about seeking to create a diverse workforce because it would be beneficial to the organization. Before 1990, most large companies had an Employment Equity and Affirmative Action Officer, usually a lower-level employee who worked in the bowels of the organization compiling statistics about how many employees were in targeted groups, eg, people of color and women. Diversity - A Numbers Game Throughout the 1990's, diversity continued to be about the numbers of different kinds of people in the workforce as a whole and at each level. Diversity staffs tried to increase the number of people of color and women in their organizations. They saw this primarily as a hiring task. During that decade, the definition of diversity expanded. Diversity came to include many dimensions beyond gender and race: age, class, disability, ethnicity, family situation, religion, and sexual orientation. Companies started to pay attention to their representation of all these groups. It became clear over the years that it was not enough to focus on hiring alone. It became important to retain ""diverse"" workers, as well. Some organizations were astonished to learn that after years of effort, they had fewer African Americans than they had earlier. Companies became aware that for the most part the upper ranks of their organizations remained heavily white and predominately male. These were the years when companies offered cultural diversity awareness training and diversity skills training to help their newly diverse employees work well together. It's the Culture Today, in the 2000's, as organizations try to retain diverse employees in their workforce, companies have started looking at the quality of these employees' experience in the organization. Do employees in all groups and categories feel comfortable and welcomed in the organization? Do they feel included and do they experience the environment as inclusive? To answer these questions, diversity staffs need to assess their environment and identify the barriers to inclusion, whether they are practices, policies, or the informal culture of the organization. Having identified barriers, the job of the diversity staff is to change the company culture and to create an inclusive workplace environment. Systems and Policies As inclusion becomes the focus of diversity work, the attention switches to the systems, policies and practices of the company. Several systems influence the degree to which the climate is inclusive:    • Communications    • Work assignment    • Training and education    • Performance management    • Mentoring    • Coaching    • Hiring    • Career development    • Flexible work arrangements; and    • Managers' accountability. Companies that are known for their inclusive climate do not rely on the goodwill of their managers but work hard so that each organizational system is equitable. Once barriers are identified, they take action to address them. Each system is analyzed to determine the degree to which it provides equitable access and benefits to all employees. Creating an Inclusive Environment: A Case Study Here is an example of how one company addressed inclusion issues: A division of an institute in the defense industry had the reputation of not being welcoming to women. For years, they had experienced difficulty in both hiring and retaining female employees at all levels but particularly in the highest ranks of management. For years they clung to the idea that what they needed to do was to hire two or three high-level women. But to their chagrin, as soon as they would hire a new high-level female executive, it seemed one of the other high-level women would resign. At first they explained these recurrent departures in terms of the personalities of the women - ""She has family problems,"" ""She is too aggressive,"" or ""She is too timid."" Gradually it dawned on them that these resignations were not about the women, they were about the culture and the organizational climate. This led to a whole new strategy. The director of the division created a Diversity Task Force to suggest and implement changes that would create a more inclusive workplace in order to support the efforts to recruit and retain women. The Task Force was supported with resources and time for its work. Guided by an organizational consultant and working in small action teams, they first conducted a series of focus groups to identify the issues and concerns of women in the division. Then they moved into action, devising a number of changes and short-term projects to address the important issues. As soon as a team implemented a change or completed a project, they took on another. Here are some of their accomplishments over the first two years:    • They created a buddy system for all new employees   • Senior Managers hosted a series of lunches to meet lower-level women engineers and learn about their projects    • All brochures about the division were revised to include pictures of women    • They created a website where articles about women in the workplace were posted   • They developed a special relationship with a women's engineering college, inviting students from that college to come on-site for field trips and setting up summer internships for women undergraduate engineers    • They instituted networking and professional development events for women    • Senior managers attended two training programs, ""Men and Women Working Together"" and ""Flexibility."" Two of their learnings about creating an inclusive climate were: 1) It doesn't take huge amounts of money to make significant progress; and 2) Changing an organizational culture is about doing many small things, not one or two big things. In reality, as this story attests, creating an inclusive environment is about a hundred small changes. As you look at your own organization, ask yourself: What are we doing, in ways large or small, to move from yesterday's diversity to today's need for inclusion?

Financial experts know that a diversified portfolio is the best way to build wealth, and business experts know that a culturally-diverse candidate pool is the best way to build a staff that will provide the maximum performance and results. “Study after study shows diversity creates a positive impact on businesses,” says Tracey de Morsella, who produces the Multicultural Advantage, a Web site with resources to help employers increase their effectiveness in diversity recruiting. Miami-based Convergence Media Inc., runs the site and publishes multicultural-focused directories. “Studies show culturally-diverse companies increase productivity, creativity and develop new and more varied products and services,” de Morsella says. “Most new business owners think, ‘I’ll deal with that later.’ Cultural diversity seems out of reach, but there are benefits to doing it right away.” Just don’t confuse diversity with representation, says Roosevelt Thomas, CEO of Roosevelt Thomas Consulting & Training in Atlanta, Ga., and author of Building on the Promise of Diversity (AMACOM Books, 2005, $27.95). Plan to Manage Diversity “Most companies who think they’re talking about diversity are really talking about representation,” Thomas says. He defines “representation” as a workforce that racially and ethnically reflects a company’s customer base. “The main benefit to a representative workforce is that society expects it,” he says. “Truth be told, it’s difficult to get ‘diversity’ through representation because most employers want to assimilate their candidates to their way of thinking and doing things. Those companies may have a ‘diverse’ workforce, but they also have a sameness of thought.” For example, Thomas says, if you hire African American, Hispanic and Asian candidates who all have Ivy League educations, you’re not getting diversity at all. Attribute and behavioral diversity don’t always come along with diverse ethnicities, he says. Functional diversity takes time to develop and it comes with its own set of challenges. “True diversity breeds difficulties, tensions and complexities,” Thomas says, “and that can be difficult to manage.” Companies need to plan for training, building skills, policies and processes to effectively manage diversity. Even so, Thomas says, companies are more likely to reach truly functional diversity with a representative workforce. “They should take on the challenge right away.” Managed well, diversity helps companies avoid that innovation-killer called groupthink, which locks employees into one way of thinking and stifles the ability to compete. Study after study has shown that cultural diversity improves customer focus, spurs creativity and innovation, and leads to better decision-making and problem solving, de Morsella says. Your Workforce Should Look Like Your Customer Base The population of America is changing. According to the 2004 U.S. Census, Hispanics (14.1 percent) now are the largest minority group, with African Americans (12.8 percent) second. Experts predict that by 2050, people of color will outnumber white Americans. Women, 51 percent of the marketplace, are also changing the American landscape. Research findings by BusinessWeek and Gallup led to a forecast that by 2010, women are expected to control $1 trillion, or 60 percent of the country’s wealth. They already buy or influence the purchase of 80 percent of all consumer goods. These are the faces of the marketplace, and if they’re not seen in your company, they’re likely to take their business elsewhere, de Morsella warns. Make Your Business Attractive to Diverse Candidates Diversity candidates are like any others - they want to find an employer with whom they’ll feel comfortable, have opportunities to advance and make a decent income. But, de Morsella notes, “If you have 20 people on staff and they’re all white guys, you send a weird message.” So how do you get a diverse staff? “You don’t go out looking for a black man or a Latino woman,” she says. There are potential legal minefields associated with diversity hiring, such as reserving spots or job openings solely for diverse candidates. It’s reverse discrimination and illegal. “The biggest mistake that companies [startups or established] make is being afraid - afraid of being called racist, being accused of setting quotas, etc.,” says Damali Ayo, a Portland writer and artist whose book, How to Rent a Negro (Lawrence Hill Books, 2005, $14.95) is intended to encourage open dialogue about race in the workplace. “People are so afraid of ‘doing it wrong’ when it comes to cultural diversity that procrastination and cowardice easily find their way in. Thus some companies who are strong in many areas find themselves weak in cultural diversity.” As you create your recruiting materials, build in a diversity message that says, “This is a great place to work,” Ayo says. “You just need to broaden your talent pool, and you’ll have no problem finding people from varied backgrounds.” Does Your Web Site Reflect Diversity? One easy way to attract a broad talent pool is by adding a diversity page to your Web site, de Morsella says: “This is a very low-cost method and will help your site show up on search engines for diversity. “If you’re not sure how to do it, go to the sites of major companies with a reputation for good diversity programs – Microsoft and Merrill Lynch, for example - and use them as a model.” De Morsella also urges including minorities and women on your board. “This puts a diverse face on your company and makes those from diverse backgrounds want to work with you,” she says. Widen Your Candidate Pool One of the simplest ways to recruit for diversity is posting your company on minority-focused Web sites that offer various combinations of job listings, recruitment-marketing services and diversity-related news (see related sidebar). De Morsella suggests that when looking for highly skilled talent and executives, tap into the local chapters of national groups. “It’s much less expensive,” she says. “Working through the national organization could cost up to $20K.” For entry- to mid-level, she advises looking to such advocacy groups as the Urban League. “I’ve done this to hire sales staff and interns, and it’s worked out great,” she says. “Most large cities have a local chapter and will be happy to send candidates right away.” It Won’t Pay If You Delay Begin your efforts to hire a representative staff as soon as possible because cultural diversity can make a huge difference in the bottom line. Robert Rodriguez is faculty chair in the School of Business & Technology at Capella University online, and chairman for the Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement, a nonprofit that helps companies attract, develop and retain Latino talent. On the Society for Human Resource Management Web site, he recounts how a representative and diverse workforce led to big profits for Frito-Lay. The Latino Employee Network at Frito-Lay proved invaluable during the development of Doritos Guacamole Flavored Tortilla Chips, Rodriguez writes. Members of the network provided feedback on the taste and packaging to help ensure authenticity, helping launch one of the most successful products in the company’s history. The snack generated more than $100 million in sales in the first year alone. “A diverse staff is going to give you the best performance and results,” Ayo says. “A diverse staff is only one of the tools you need to build the best business possible. You should treat it with the same immediacy and importance as you would in finding the right tools in every other area. “Become a leader in creating a diverse staff. Your clients’ confidence, staff morale, press coverage, productivity and, of course, your profits will increase for doing it.” About the Author Jackie Headapohl is a freelance writer for StartupNation.

With these principles in mind, here are ten things you must do if you want to  hire more top people and diversity candidates . All are essential. Nine out of ten is not good enough. Here's the 10-step recipe: 1. Create compelling jobs.  If a top person is fully employed or has multiple offers, then the quality of the job will be one of the top four factors determining which job the person will ultimately take (the other three: the manager, the company, the comp). If your online job descriptions start with a part number (or the requisition number) followed by the official title, the location, and some list of skills and requirements, you won't hire many good people. The title and the first two lines of the ad determine whether it will be read, so make sure that these first two lines create a buzz. The next paragraph must describe some of the projects and challenges in the job. Focus on the possibilities -- what the person will do, learn, and become -- not the requirements. I refer to this type of job description as a performance profile (here's an article for more on this). Make the person want to click the ""apply"" button. Referred candidates will always read the online job description before getting too interested. So don't ignore this step if you want to hire more culturally-diverse candidates or any type of person in high demand. 2. Job brand the job.  Somewhere in the job description, tie the job to the company vision, its mission, a big project, or some important strategy. This makes the job bigger than itself. ""Help us land the next generation of moon walkers,"" will be Northrup's and Boeing's message for the next shuttle program, even for those people working at the rec center. 3. Culturally brand the job.  Do you really have a culture that thrives on diversity, or are you just meeting some corporate objective? How many African-Americans, Hispanics, and women have been promoted this past year as a percent of all promotions? You need to capture cultural diversity directly into the job with more than just a legal-sounding EEO statement. 4. Develop marketing-oriented sourcing programs based on how your future employees look  for and apply for jobs.  Top people and candidates in high demand don't look for jobs or accept offers using the same job hunting approach as most people. For one thing, they're much more discriminating. The primary decision to take a new job is based on the future opportunity and current challenges. That's why steps 1-3 above are critical starting points. Since these people look for jobs infrequently, the jobs must be easy to find when they do look. We're now doing a big research study on how different diversity candidate groups look for new jobs (send an email to info@adlerconcepts.com if you want to participate or learn more). The results so far indicate that you can't go wrong by making jobs highly visible with compelling titles and great copy wherever your jobs are posted. As part of this, your career site must be easy to find, and it must make a diversity statement tied to the company strategy on the first page. Rather than hyperbole, why not have bios and pictures of real people who represent the opportunities for diversity candidates and women within your company? 5. Reach out and find your candidate.  If your target audience won't come to you, you'd better go out to them. This means you must leverage your employee referral program, and creatively use tools like ZoomInfo, Jobster, and LinkedIn, as well as advanced Internet data-mining techniques. For a start, establish an aggressive employee referral program targeted to your current diverse employees. Personally ask these pre-selected employees for the names of the best people they've ever worked with. Then get on the phone to recruit and network with these people, to leverage these names to get more names. You might want to conduct a Jobster campaign in combination with ZoomInfo's ethnic searching capability to jumpstart your efforts here. Regardless, make sure the job descriptions are compelling -- or everything else you do will be wasted. 6. Stay involved.  Make your marketing a process, not an event. My old UCLA MBA buddy, Henry Hernandez, now the VP and chief diversity officer at American Express, gave me this sage advice many years ago. The basic theme: Don't just show up for some recruiting event. Instead, you need to promote, sponsor, be involved, and be committed -- every month, every year, and not just a few days here and there. Providing the resources and time is how you convert lip-service into reality. 7. Get hiring managers involved early and often.  The recruiting department can't do it alone. Managers must be committed to the process and they must devote extra time and effort to make it work. They must devote even more time upfront to get it started. If you do everything else right but fail on this step, the process will collapse. 8. Conduct a professional and thorough interview . Too many people think the purpose of the interview is to assess candidate competency. Most of these same people don't even do this part too well, either. But the interview can and must be much more than this when hiring top people in any field -- and even more importantly when there is competition for these people. In these cases, the interview must meet these multi-factor criteria: • Extreme professionalism is exhibited by all interviewers. • The candidate spends at least an hour with key decision-makers. • The process respects a top candidate's slower and more thorough decision-making process. • The candidate is confident the interviewer has conducted a thorough and accurate assessment. • The candidate has talked four times more than the interviewer. • The candidate leaves wanting the job. I've written a lot of articles on these pages on how to do this. Have many of your managers know how to accomplish the above? 9. Recruit and close.  You'd better be able to handle every objection in the book, offer competitive compensation packages, and know how to use the interview to create opportunities. You do this by describing compelling challenges and having candidates describe relevant past accomplishments. Dig deep to validate the candidate's true role. Candidates need to earn the job during the interview. If you oversell, under-listen, or give the job away, you won't hire many high-dema  "

Although it may be this individual's job to    conduct interviews, he or she has nonetheless devoted an important    amount of time to discuss your qualifications and achievements.      Thank-you letters can vary in length from a few sentences to a few    paragraphs depending upon how you would like to utilize the letter. A    thank-you note can accomplish the following:           Thank the interviewer for his or her time, which is done easily     by simply writing ""Thank you"" or ""I would like to thank you"" at the     beginning of the letter.       Emphasize your qualifications. You may include phrases like     ""With my strong communication skills, I believe that I would be an     asset to your firm"" or ""With my determination for success and     ability to work well with others, I would be a strong resource at     your organization"". You don't need to include details about your     qualifications if you have already discussed them at the interview.     Simply recap one or two of your most outstanding merits or     strengths. However, you can also use the thank-you letter to mention     skills or experience you offer that you did not get to discuss at     the interview.       Integrate an opportunity for continuing communication with the     interviewer and/or the employer. Even if you don't think the     interview went smoothly, write your thank-you letter with     confidence. Indicate that you continue to be interested in the     position. Statements such as ""I am interested in starting a career     at (name of employer)"" or ""I would be willing to discuss my interest     again with you at your convenience"" will keep channels open for     other interviews or perhaps an offer.         If your interviewer told you that he or she would pass your resume to    someone else, express your appreciation and state your enthusiasm to    meet this person. Employers want to know that you are excited about the    possibility of employment and that you are eager to continue the    interview process. This correspondence paves the way for further contact    from the interviewer or another person at the company.      In addition to keeping communication open, sending a thank-you letter    will tell the interviewer that you already have the polished etiquette    skills of a professional employee. In general, you should type your    thank-you letters and envelopes in business form. In some cases, you may    feel it is appropriate to hand write a thank-you note to the    interviewer. If you choose this method, make sure that your handwriting    is very legible and use plain stationery.      Thank-you letters should be sent promptly within a few days after the    interview. Make sure that you have the correct spelling of the    interviewer's name, title, and mailing address. As with your resume and    cover letter, correct format and spelling are essential. Carefully    proofread your thank-you letters.      If you interview with more than one person at an organization, it is    appropriate to send a letter to each person you have met. At some    on-site interviews, you may see many people during your visit. Even if    you interview with 20 different people, it is a good idea to write to    each one. Try to reflect on something you discussed with each    individual. Try to make each letter a bit different when you are writing    to several people at one employer.      Don't underestimate the power of etiquette and attention to detail.    The interview does not end when you head for the door. The possibility    of an offer continues with the thank-you letter.                                                                                                        Test Preparation                         Schools & Programs   ( by     State )               Letter & Writing                         Career & Training                                                           SAT                                                     GRE               GMAT               LSAT               MCAT               TOEFL               IELTS                                                               Colleges and              Universities                            Graduate Schools                            Engineering Schools                            Business Schools               Medical              Schools               Law Schools                            Dental Schools                                                                             Personal Statement               Resume                                          Recommendation Letter               Business Letter                             Cover Letter                             Job Interview               Job Application Letter                                                                                      GED                 Professional Exams                                          Community Colleges               Online Degree               Financial Aid               Study Abroad                             International Students                                                                   Link to us  |                Contact us  |                Home  Copyright 2009       The Eduers.com .

The Importance of the Thank You Letter                                                    You've completed a successful job interview. What's the next step? You send a ""thank you"" letter thanking the interviewer for his or her time. This simple act can give you an edge over other interviewees. It's a common courtesy that allows you the opportunity to reiterate your interest in the job and keep your name in front of an interviewer. Some tips for creating an effective ""thank you"" letter:    * Make sure to send your note within 24 hours of your interview.    * You can either handwrite or type your thank you letter. Tailor it to fit the company's culture. Decide if it's more appropriate to send a formal typed letter or a personal handwritten note.    * If you choose to e-mail your letter, you should send a hardcopy too. E-mail is a fast way to get your letter in front of the right people, but a mailed letter is the best choice.    * Your writing reflects you - make sure it is error free. Check the letter for grammar, spelling and punctuation.    * Make the note personal. Don't just copy your note from an old letter you have on file. Reference specific things you talked about in the interview.    * If you interview with a few people, send a note to each one. Although you can use the same letter for each, try to tailor a sentence or two to that specific person    * If you expect a decision soon, find a way to get your note in the interviewer's hands fast - consider using e-mail, fax, or hand-delivery. A ""thank you"" letter can send an important message about you. It shows that you are truly interested in the job and want to project a positive image. It is the perfect opportunity to remind your potential employer of your qualifications and how you would fit in with the company. It also gives you the chance to correct any mistakes you might have made or add anything you might have missed.

The Importance of the Thank You Letter                                                    You've completed a successful job interview. What's the next step? You send a ""thank you"" letter thanking the interviewer for his or her time. This simple act can give you an edge over other interviewees. It's a common courtesy that allows you the opportunity to reiterate your interest in the job and keep your name in front of an interviewer. Some tips for creating an effective ""thank you"" letter:    * Make sure to send your note within 24 hours of your interview.    * You can either handwrite or type your thank you letter. Tailor it to fit the company's culture. Decide if it's more appropriate to send a formal typed letter or a personal handwritten note.    * If you choose to e-mail your letter, you should send a hardcopy too. E-mail is a fast way to get your letter in front of the right people, but a mailed letter is the best choice.    * Your writing reflects you - make sure it is error free. Check the letter for grammar, spelling and punctuation.    * Make the note personal. Don't just copy your note from an old letter you have on file. Reference specific things you talked about in the interview.    * If you interview with a few people, send a note to each one. Although you can use the same letter for each, try to tailor a sentence or two to that specific person    * If you expect a decision soon, find a way to get your note in the interviewer's hands fast - consider using e-mail, fax, or hand-delivery. A ""thank you"" letter can send an important message about you. It shows that you are truly interested in the job and want to project a positive image. It is the perfect opportunity to remind your potential employer of your qualifications and how you would fit in with the company. It also gives you the chance to correct any mistakes you might have made or add anything you might have missed.

They're not saying that they don't consider job skills important; however, first and foremost, they want their employees to have positive attitudes. You can probably relate. Nobody wants to be around someone that is negative or complaining all of the time. This ideal incorporates into the workplace. A positive attitude fosters a positive work environment. An upbeat employee is more likely to be productive, motivated and well liked. How can you project a positive attitude? Put on a happy face - You can't help but feel good when you smile. It is also contagious. When you smile, your co-workers will smile and so on. There will be positive energy in the office. Focus on the task at hand - Don't think about what went wrong yesterday. We all make mistakes. If you give your work 100% of your attention, you will have the concentration to do a good job. Stop the complaining - We all experience things that we do not agree with or do not like. However, instead of lingering on the negative, choose to forget about it and move on. A positive front will go further to advance your career. Create an inviting work space - You can create a positive work environment by keeping things organized. Clutter often leads to frustration and missed deadlines. Also, add a favorite photo or keepsake. Keep a positive outlook - Look at each day as a new challenge. By focusing on the positive, you will be more likely to get excited about work. Think of all the possibilities the day has to offer. A positive attitude is important, but it isn't everything. There are many qualities that add up to a successful employee. Remember to practice good work habits, follow directions, and use competent communication skills. It is also essential to dress suitably, use appropriate behavior, and demonstrate good job skills and knowledge of work operations. Remember that a good attitude can get you ahead, while a bad one might stifle your chances for success.

This simple piece of paper represents you and your employment history. It can determine if you get called for an interview or overlooked for another candidate. Considering this importance, you should make sure that your resume makes a good impression. You've created a resume before, but there might be additional tips that you didn't know. Use this helpful advice to get your foot in the door: -Include a clear and concise job objective. Make sure to highlight this at the top of your resume. Give potential employers a clear idea of your professional goals. -Modify your resume for the role you are applying for. You should tailor your resume to match the type of job you want. Change the objective and emphasize relevant skills. You don't want the main focus of your resume to be on experience that has nothing to do with the type of job you want. -Make sure you have relevant job experience. You need to have experience in the type of job you are applying for. Volunteer to get the skills you need, or highlight your existing skills and illustrate how they apply to the new position. -Include 10 to 15 years of work experience. This can help shorten the length of your resume and provide the most relevant work experience. If you have important experience beyond those years, you can mention it in your cover letter. -Don't include hobbies or personal information. Unless the hobby or information is relevant to the type of job you are seeking, you shouldn't include it on your resume. -Use action words to describe your duties. Pick strong verbs to explain your work history. Words such as ""managed, maintained, budgeted, performed, and exceeded"" are good ones to use to describe your duties. Make sure you get the interview you want. Review your existing resume and make sure it adheres to the guidelines above. It might make the difference of receiving a phone call or getting passed over in favor of a candidate with a better resume. Even if you are the best choice, you are only as good as your resume.

This is because   knowing how to write a resume  is only one  part of the equation. Combined with resume distribution efforts and networking,  solid resume cover letter writing can have a positive impact on your job search  campaign. Resume cover letters serve as an additional opportunity to sell your  worth.     Most job seekers decide to send their resume “naked” – without the benefit of a  strong resume cover letter. This is a big mistake. Resume cover letter writing  complements the resume since the content is written directly to the open position.  The cover letter helps the decision maker to draws conclusions. A resume cover letter can  make a difference between whether you are invited to an interview.      Including the resume cover letter, a job search requires other types of  correspondence including a thank you and resignation letter. Just like cover  letter writing, all job search letters share common goals – they should be  personal and leave a lasting impression on the reader. Without strong writing  skills, cover letter writing, thank-you letters and resignation letters is going  to be a challenge.

Just like your  resume  and the  job interview , your thank you letter provides one more important piece of information about you before a hiring decision is made.  Too many job candidates make the mistake of thinking that writing an interview thank you letter is optional - it's not.  But you're smarter than they are and that's why you're going to write one.   Interview Thank You Letters           Additional Resources         Behavioral Interviewing Technique     Job Interview Question Database     Behavioral Interview Question Database     Interview Power Words     Writing an Interview Thank You Letter   In fact, studies suggest that less than 10% of all interviewees follow up with an interview thank you letter.  That's good news for you because it gives you the chance to separate yourself from the rest of the pack.   Does writing a thank you letter lock you in as the successful candidate?  It's doubtful someone would make a hiring decision based solely on receiving a thank you.  But, that's not to say that a thank you letter wouldn't be used as a ""tie-breaker.""  The point here is this - regardless of your success in getting a job, an interview thank you letter leaves the  hiring manager  with a good impression of you and that can come in handy.   Thank You Letter Format   When you're writing an interview thank you letter, the format you'll want to use includes three components:     You'll want to start off by thanking the interviewer for taking the time, and giving you the opportunity, to speak with them directly.  You'll personalize this section of the thank you letter by providing information specific to your interview.    Next, you'll want to express your interest in working for their company and the job for which you interviewed.  This section can also be customized to something that was said or an experience you had during the actual interview.    Finally, you'll close out the thank you letter by reiterating your appreciation for the interview; offer to provide additional information if they have a questions and tell the interviewer that you're looking forward to hearing back from them on a decision.   You don't want to oversell yourself on the thank you letter.  The format used here is clean and to the point.   Recipients of Thank You Letters   If you met with several members of the hiring company during the interview, then you many want to send out multiple thank you letters.  You don't need to send a thank you letter to everyone you met - but anyone that took a significant amount of time out of their busy schedule to talk with you deserves this courtesy.   Hand Written Thank You Letters   Some people think that the thank you letter you send after the interview needs to be hand written.  In most instances a hand written letter is not necessary.  We live in the world of personal computers.  Unless you believe that a hand written thank you is in order because of the culture of the company or the nature of the job opening, a typewritten letter is just fine.   Emailed Thank You Letters   Unless the urgency of the decision or culture of the company dictates an emailed thank you letter you'll normally drop the letter in the US mail instead.  Emails are convenient to send and that's part of the problem - they are also perceived as being far less personal.   If a decision is going to be made right away, you may want to email a thank you that same day and follow up with a thank you letter via the US mail.   Interview Thank You Letter Timing   You should compose your interview thank you letter as soon as possible following the interview itself - preferably the same day.  You should do this for two reasons.  The first reason has to do with simply demonstrating to the interviewer that you're willing to take the time to write the letter right away.   The second reason for sending the thank you letter out right away has to do with your memory.  You should write the letter while the experience is still fresh in your memory.   Proofreading the Thank You Letter   Just because you're sending out the thank you letter immediately post interview doesn't mean you should take shortcuts.  The letter is going to be read by the hiring manager or recruiter and it may be the final impression you leave with that person before they make a hiring decision.   The last thing you want to do is send out a letter with spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.  Have a trusted friend proofread the thank you letter before you send it out.   Interview Thank You Letter Samples   Now that you know what to include on an interview thank you letter and when you should send it out, we're going to help you get started by providing a couple of sample letters.  As always, our samples are free to download and written in Microsoft Word.   We're going to provide you with three interview thank you letter samples, each tailored to a slightly different purpose:     Interview Thank You Letter Template  - This first thank you letter sample simply follows the rules outlined above in terms of template / format.    Clarifying Interview Thank You Letter  - This second thank you sample is an example of how you might want to use an interview thank you letter to clarify a point you were trying to make during the interview.    Omission Interview Thank You Letter  - This final thank you letter sample is an example you can use if you forgot to mention something during the interview and later realized this may be important information to bring to the attention of the hiring manager.

Prep #1:      Before the Interview      For many people, the interview process is their least favorite aspect of the job search. What do I wear? How do I present myself? What am I suppose to ask? What are the best responses? It all feels a little like walking through a minefield. One wrong step and ""Kaboom!""       For others, the interview process is where they feel the most confident, secure in the knowledge that ""If I can just get the interview, I'll get the job.""       Regardless of how you feel about interviewing, good planning and preparation can substantially improve your ability to participate in a productive manner, while increasing your confidence level during this important step in the job search process.       The following are some areas to prepare before the first interview is ever accepted:      Interviewing Isn't Just About How You Answer  the Questions      Effective interviewing is more than simply responding to the tough questions with the best answers, it also requires knowing the questions to ask, in return, so that you can learn all the information you need to make an educated decision. Job candidates sometimes have their eyes so set on the goal of getting a job that they fail to completely evaluate the position or company's fit for their own needs, goals and interests.       To avoid misunderstandings, equal responsibility falls to the candidate to clarify expectations of the position, prior to accepting a job. How many times have you heard a friend or colleague comment, ""This job isn't what they said it would be.""      Some questions you may want to ask a potential employer, include:                 What do you see as this position's     responsibilities on a daily basis? Weekly? Monthly? How, if at all, do you see these     responsibilities changing over time?                  What do you feel are the  most      important responsibilities of this position? ( take   notes! )                  What are some   additional aspects of this position that are unique to your company? ( hidden   responsibilities? )                  What was the reason   for this position's vacancy? ( new need? recent   firing? expansion? )                     How long has this   company been in business? ( are you interested   in a growing company, an established company, or one that's going through   restructure? )                     How many people do   you employ? How long does the average employee remain with your company? ( frequent   turnover is a warning signal )                     What are this   company current challenges? ( this question   can produce surprising information )                  What do you view as   this company greatest goals and missions? ( consider   how you can be part of the solution here )                       Has this company experienced a downsizing at     any time in its history, and if so, when?                   How long have you   worked for this company, and what do like the most about your position here?   ( is your interviewer happy with this company? )                  See even more  questions to ask on the  Tough Commonly  Asked Interview Questions  - The Long List!        Never forget that you have some amount of control regarding the course of this interview. By being prepared and perfecting your responses, and taking an active and participatory role in the process, you'll not only make the interview process easier and more productive for you, but for your interviewer as well.       The Tough Questions               Before the first interview, prepare answers to interview questions that are especially difficult for you to answer. These questions may be as ""simple"" as ""Why do you want to work here?"" to as complicated as ""Why did you leave your last position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?""

And then see even more tough interview questions on  the  Long List of Commonly Asked  Interview Questions .      References        Before accepting the first interview, you should get your  references  in order  and you may want to request that a  letter of  recommendation  be written on your behalf. This is not something you should be thinking about after references have been requested.             Contrary to common practice, you don't want to provide references prior to an interview or include them with your resume submission, unless the job ad specifically states that references are to be included with the submission.         Keep in mind that a potential job may not live up to your expectations. You're not going to know for  certain until after you've had the opportunity to interview. There's no good  reason to have your references contacted needlessly or repeatedly for jobs you  don't plan to accept. References contacted repeatedly also tend to lose their enthusiasm in the repeated telling.       Another reason to hold  on to your reference list information until the interview is that you want the opportunity to be able to contact your references prior to the interviewer's call, so that you can give them a heads-up, ""John Doe from ABC company is going to be calling you sometime today or tomorrow. I interviewed with him today about the Project Manager position they have open."" This will give you the opportunity to tell your reference about the important issues discussed at the interview. A reference who is prepared for a call, and not caught off-guard, will appreciate the heads-up, and by understanding what the interviewer is hoping to secure, beforehand, will likely provide a better reference. Your references want to help you, make this process as easy for them as possible.       Your reference list should match your resume and cover letter in letterhead style and stationery, and should include the following information for each reference listed:      Reference Name  Current Title, Current Company  Relationship to You (Mentor, Coworker, Supervisor, Client, etc.)  Phone Number  Optional e-mail address      Make sure your references have given you permission to provide the numbers you're releasing. Providing e-mail addresses for your references is an additional option, but again, get your reference's permission prior to releasing this personal information.       Dress For Success      Attention needs to be placed on appropriate interview attire, and the time to do this is before the first interview is scheduled.      Interview attire should not necessarily reflect the style or uniform of the company or position for which you're interviewing. In other words, if the company dress code is relaxed (khaki slacks, casual shirts), your attire for the interview should remain conservative, professional, and appropriate to the event (a business interview).       A suit coat and tie is appropriate interview attire for men, a dress suit or suit jacket with tailored slacks is appropriate interview attire for women. Avoid loud patterns or excessive color. You don't want to distract your interviewer by your attire.      Your clothing need not be new, but it should be in good condition; clean, well-pressed and well-fitted. If your interview clothes are new (it's not recommended to wear brand new, out-of-the-box shoes - break them in first!), nothing can put a person ill-at-ease faster than clothes that feel uncomfortable, unnatural or don't fit well. Try your interview clothes on before an interview is scheduled (sit, stand, and walk in them), and make sure they're comfortable, as well as appropriate (ask someone else's opinion). See how the combination of clothes you've put together really look when worn together - ""Wow, this tie does not match this jacket,"" or ""This jacket needs to be tailored, it's just too long for me"" are things that should be determined long before having to walk out the door for an interview meeting. Inspect your clothing closely for any wear, stains or damage.       Interview Attire Checklist:           Don't wear cologne (this may be offensive to     your interviewer, no matter how good it smells to you).            Make sure your socks match, each other and the     outfit you're wearing.            Wear shoes that are in good condition, match     your attire, and are comfortable to wear. No loud colors. No open toes.            If you carry a purse or briefcase, these too     should be conservative in color and design.            Make certain your hands and nails are clean and     in good condition (you probably ""speak"" with your hands more than you're aware).     Men should not wear polish. Women's polish should be conservative in color and nails     should not be an excessive length.            Check your clothing for stains, tears, loose     stitching and/or loose buttons - and repair.             Do not smoke and avoid being around others who     are smoking ~ the odor will stay on your clothing and may be offensive. If you have worn     the clothing previously, have it cleaned or dry-cleaned to remove all cologne, smoking,     and other odors.            Limit the amount of jewelry you wear. Keep it     simple and conservative.                 Check out the article "" Dress  to Impress: A Guide. "" It includes photo comparisons, dress examples (men and  women) and feedback from potential employers. Very well done!      Thank You Cards and Postage Stamps      The time to purchase ""Thank you"" cards and postage stamps is before you begin to interview. Have these in supply.      Extra Resumes and Reference Sheets      Be sure you have extra copies of your resume and reference list printed. You'll want to take at least two clean copies of your resume with you to each interview: extras for any additional interviewers in the meeting, and an extra copy to help you complete an application with the correct dates and information.       Having extra reference sheets will make it easier to contact your references after the interview.   ( Back to Top )          Prep #2:  You Have An Interview!      Congratulations! Being requested to interview is a clear indication of your potential as a job candidate for this position at this company. Very few employers will interview candidates they feel are unqualified. Knowing this, it's now your job to convince the employer or hiring manager that you're not just a potential candidate, but you're the right person for the job.      The following are some preparatory steps you can take before and during the interview that will aid your chances for a successful outcome:      Where Am I Going?      Knowing where you are going is half the battle. I mean this both literally and figuratively.       How well you present yourself will depend on how well you know yourself. What do you have to offer? What are your unique professional and personal characteristics, as they directly relate to the positions you are targeting? What are your personal and professional aspirations? What is it you are looking to achieve?       When that self-knowledge, or literal meaning of ""knowing where you are going,"" is completed, you need to take care of the figurative meaning of ""knowing where you're going"" by figuring out where the interview is going to be held and how you're going to get there.       One of the first things you should do after an interview is scheduled is to drive to the interview location (at least a day before the actual interview) to determine the location and how long it takes to get there. You certainly don't want to be late for this all-important appointment by underestimating travel time or travel conditions (or worse, get completely lost). By driving to the location (or taking the bus or whatever other transportation you'll) at the same time of day for which your appointment's scheduled, you'll be able to clock the time it takes you to get there, identify the level of traffic and any potential hold-ups (due to construction or road conditions), and locate where you'll be able to park your vehicle (is there a parking fee involved?). If you're taking a bus or other form of public transportation, you should time the distance from your bus stop to the front door of the building.       Once at the location, you should determine which building entry door leads to your interviewer's office, and on which floor the office is located. Is there a public restroom close by? Knowing this will save you time if you want one last opportunity to check a mirror, fix a tie or comb your hair.       If you add at least ten minutes to your travel time, you'll help to avoid any unexpected delays. If this added time makes you a few minutes early for your appointment, so much the better.       Darn, I Forgot To Ask . . .             Prepare a brief, written list of questions to take with you. A question you desperately wanted to ask the night before may vanish once you find yourself in the interview (""I've answered twenty questions, what was I going to ask?!""). Some questions may have arisen during the phone contact you had with the interviewer in setting up the interview appointment (""Mr. Jones mentioned _______, I need to ask him about that""). Or you may have questions regarding information you have learned about the company during your homework investigation (""ABC Company is showing expansion into the European Market. I'd like to learn more about this"").       Don't trust your powers of memory during an interview appointment, and don't allow the interviewer to take total control of the course the interview. This is a two-way exchange, and the only way that you can learn all the information you need to know to make an informed decision is by asking the types of questions that are meaningful to you.       Expect your interviewer to ask, ""Are there any questions you have about ABC Company?"" or ""Is there anything else you would like to know?"" and be prepared to have a response. Having been given this opportunity to address questions at your interviewer's convenience, don't assume that this same invitation will apply the next day (or when you get home and realize you failed to ask an all-important question). In other words, your interviewer may not appreciate a follow up call that begins with, ""Mr. Jones, after our interview I realized I had a few more questions I'd like you to answer . . .""       What Did They Say?!      It's a good idea to take notes during the interview (so add a clean pad of paper and working pen to the list of items to bring). The very first thing you should write down is your interviewer's name (this may not be the same person who called you), including the correct spelling (even if you have to ask the receptionist).       During the interview, write down the key criteria discussed and reiterate this information with your interviewer, ""As I understand it, Mr. Jones, this position will require . . ."" Using these notes to clarify your understanding of the position, both its responsibilities and expectations, and communicate your understanding back to your interviewer - this is called ""mirroring."" Mirroring will help clear any potential misunderstanding and will also give you a better record of what was discussed and agreed upon during the interview.       The notes you take will also be used when you write your follow up ""Thank you"" note, following the interview.       What To Take            Be prepared to bring along at least two clean copies of your resume to the interview. You may be interviewed by more than one person, and you will want to make sure these additional interviewers have clean copies of your presentation (rather than a photocopied version). You also may be required to complete an application. Having your resume with you will help you complete the form without trying (again) to remember specific dates and events.       Bring along at least two copies of your reference list to the interview appointment (one to give, one to use to call your references following the interview). Provide this to your interviewer only after you've determined  this is a position you still want to pursue. There's no need (or benefit) in having your references contacted needlessly.      You shouldn't need a suitcase, but here are some suggestions of items to take:           Directions and phone number for the company, in     case something deters your arrival.             A folder (to prevent bending) containing at     least two clean copies of your resume and two copies of your reference list.             A pad of paper with a list of prepared     questions you want to ask (and for taking additional notes).            Two pens (now is not the time to find out your     only pen is out of ink).             A comb or hairbrush and a pocket mirror.             Tissues, wet naps, or a small washcloth (trust     me, these can be a lifesaver).            Toothbrush and toothpaste (especially if it is     an after-work appointment) or breath spray.             Travel-size antiperspirant (Did I or didn't I?     You can never be too sure).             Umbrella (if there is any potential for rain).             Women: an extra pair of pantyhose or clear nail     polish for quick repair. Men: an extra tie.             Correct change for parking, if necessary.              Final Preparation                Re-read all the information you have gathered     about the company and re-read your prepared questions.               Practice your interview responses to tough     questions (best if done out loud). I've compiled a   long list of commonly asked tough   interview questions  for you to become familiar with the types of   questions you'll be asked, and to help you prepare your responses. In   addition, If you'd like me to e-mail you a file on some of the     toughest interview questions  and their best responses :       e-mail     Sue Campbell     -  it's free!  Or try the  online   interview questions quiz  and see how you do.            Make time to relax, even if it's just for     10 minutes, and do positive affirmation exercises (envision yourself working for this     company and envision a positive outcome to the interview).             Continue to give yourself positive messages     throughout the day (""I'm a great candidate for this position” - “I can make     a positive difference in this company"").             Get a good night's sleep, and get up earlier     than normal for early morning appointments, so that you have plenty of time before the     interview to get ready and relax.            Take a leisurely walk if you find yourself     feeling overwhelmed with pre-interview jitters.             Eat well (do not skip meals!), and avoid foods     that commonly disagree with you.             Even if your interview appointment is scheduled     for your lunch hour, prepare to take something with you that can be eaten beforehand. Dry     cereal and a bottle of water will work in a pinch to stop stomach noises and nervous     stomach acid.             Confirm that baby sitters will arrive on time,     and have a back up plan if this fails.             Have backup transportation.            Make certain any other responsibilities are     accounted for, in case the interview runs longer than you assumed (clear your schedule,     etc.).            For people who suffer from sweaty palms during     stressful situations, apply antiperspirant followed by foot or body powder to the palms of     your hands, and blot with a facial tissue or cloth (to remove any excess). Really, this     works.             Okay, This Is It!      You have arrived on time. In fact, you're early. You are appropriately dressed. You have memorized every piece of information on this company you could lay your hands on. You have honed your communication skills to perfection. You know what you are looking for and what you have to offer. You have contacted your references and they are ready and prepared to come to your aid. You have your ""Thank you"" cards at home with postage stamps affixed. You have all the necessary items with you (resume copies, references, pad of paper, pens, prepared questions, etc.), and you have a winning attitude.       Like an actor preparing for a theater performance; after the makeup artist, the lighting manager, the stage director, and the choreographer have done their part, and after the actor (you) has learned his or her lines to perfection . . . opening night comes and the actor steps out on the stage, confident that he or she is ready to put into action all that he or she has learned in preparation for this moment.           Worth a review:  Equal  Employment Opportunity Laws          ( Back  to Top )        Prep #3:      After The Interview      You've had the interview. Now it’s time for taking notes .                 Write down everything you can remember from the     interview, including:           The responsibilities of the position as you     understand them            Any key points or concerns discussed at the     interview (particularly any deficits noted)            Specific goals of the company and/or       company projects for which the position is responsible            Names of key personnel in the company (and the     correct spelling and pronunciation)            Any other issues or information you have     learned about the company or interviewer that is of value             Contacting Your References      Contact each of your references to let him or her know that a call will be coming and from whom (name of interviewer / name of company). Tell each of your references about the position (title and responsibilities) and any key areas that need to be addressed - What is the interviewer trying to secure in potential candidates for the position?      Writing The ""Thank you"" Letter      A ""Thank you"" card should be sent within 24 hours following an interview. It's preferable to send an actual card, rather than a letter (more personable), handwritten - if your handwriting is neat and legible.      You should send a ""Thank you"" card to each individual involved in your interview.       Include the following in your letter:           Your interviewer's name (and correct spelling).     If there was more than one interviewer, each should receive his or her own personalized     thank you letter.            Key points discussed during the interview.     These should include the objective of the position you're targeting, the goal and mission     of company or department, and any special concerns or considerations discussed.            Any positive contributions you feel your     particular skills and experience will bring to this particular company's goals and     missions (including any that were actually discussed during the interview).             For more information, read my article on  Thank You Letters      Preparing For The Next Interview      The initial interview may not have resulted in the guarantee of a position, so you need to be prepared for the next interview, whether it's a second interview with this company or an initial interview with another company.      Your interview clothing needs to be cleaned and prepared for the next opportunity. For second interviews, a second interview dress needs to be made ready (this doesn't have to be an entirely new outfit, it can simply be a different shirt, tie, blouse or skirt worn with the same basic suit).       For  second interviews , a new list of questions and responses need to be prepared. Take what you've learned from the first interview (including any questions or concerns you or the interviewer may have expressed) and formulate a plan. What answers do you need to secure? How can you reduce the interviewer's concerns during round two? What types of solutions can you suggest? What problems can you solve? Used what you've learned from this interview to avoid any potential pitfalls in interviews with new companies, too.      If you've exhausted your resume copies, it's time to have new ones printed.      Until a job offer has been presented AND you've accepted it, your job search isn't over. Keep submitting resumes, polishing your interview skills, and being prepared for the next opportunity.

However, in deciding whether or not to write a thank          you letter, you should keep in mind the fact that the interview process          is largely guided by impressions. The feelings, positive or negative,          that the members of a search committee form about your character will go          a long way towards helping them to make their hiring decision. As a          result, any chance you have to show the search committee that you are a          wellindividual should not be ignored. While there are many          opportunities during the interview process to show off your good          character, the thank you letter is often the last chance that you will          have to clue the search committee in to the fact that you are the person          whom they should hire, so it is important to make this opportunity          count!                       As is often the case for so much in          life, there is more than one right way to write a thank you letter. The          following guidelines are what have worked well during my foray into the          library science job market. However, while the tips listed below are          based largely on my experiences, I also worked hard to include          additional advice from career counselors, professional librarians,          employment-related websites, and conversations on e-mail lists such as          NEXGENLIB-L.             Why send a thank          you letter?                     Sending a thank you letter is a great          way to show a search committee that you are a conscientious and          thoughtful person, two characteristics that all employers look for. The          fact that you took the time to write (and thank you letters do not take          much time to write, so this will not be an overly burdensome task) will          also reinforce the idea that you are a professional who is very          interested in the position being offered, especially if other candidates          fail to thank the search committee for their interviews. Thank you          letters can also serve grander purposes. They present you with an          opportunity to correct a mistake or repair a misunderstanding that          occurred during your interview. They allow you one last opportunity to          sell yourself to the search committee. Finally, thank you letters also          allow you to create a dialog with one or more of the search committee          members, giving you additional opportunities to sell both yourself and          your credentials.                      While you may think that sending a thank          you letter is akin to issing up,this is not the case. The thank you          letter is a professional courtesy and an opportunity to reconnect with          the members of the search committee and promote yourself, nothing more.           However, sending flowers or gifts to the search committee after your          interview is something that you should never do during your job search.          It is in poor taste and it also makes you look desperate, which will in          turn make the search committee less likely to hire you.            Who should be          sent a thank you letter?           If you have been interviewed          by a search committee, it is best if you send a letter to each committee          member individually, rather than writing one letter addressed to the          entire committee or only to the committee head. Sending individual          letters gives your letter a more personal feel and enables you to form a          connection with each member of the committee. If you have forgotten the          names of the search committee members during the stress of the          interview, it is perfectly acceptable to ask for their names again at          the end of the interview and write those names down. Just make sure to          check that you are spelling the names correctly! Finally, if you met at          length with other individuals who were not on the search committee, it          is polite to send those individuals a thank you note as well.            When to send          your thank you letter           Thank you letters          should be sent after a face-to-face interview, but they can also be sent          after a phone interview. Personally, I have sent thank you notes during          both the phone and face-to-face stages of the interview process. I see          no problem with sending out multiple thank you notes for one position,          particularly when you are meeting with different people during each          stage of the interview process.            You should send          your thank you letter out as soon as possible after the interview,          preferably within 24 hours. However, this can vary depending on the          timeline given to you by the members of the search committee as to when          they will be making their decision, so make sure to ask for this          information if it is not given to you at the end of your interview. If          the committee is going to be making its final decision later that day, a          thank you letter will probably not do you much good. However, if this is          the first of several interviews, sending the letter can only reflect          well on you should you be chosen for a follow up interview. If the          committee will not be making their decision for several days or weeks          you can wait a few days before sending the letter, but don wait too          long. I have found that if I put this task off, even for a day, it tends          to never get done. If, like me, you have trouble remembering to send          your letter after the stress of an interview, it may be a good idea to          leave yourself a note as a reminder. In any case, whenever you do decide          to send your letter, make sure that it will arrive before the search          committee announces its decision, and check your e-mail and phone          messages before you send the letter. As I have learned from personal          experience, it can be awkward to send your letter after you have already          been notified of the search committee decision.             How to send your          thank you letter                     I use the term hank you letter,but          your thank you letter is much more likely to be a thank you -mail,         especially if you are dealing with time sensitive conditions where a          decision will be made rather quickly. E-mail is an accepted form of          communication, and many search committees even communicate with their          candidates or send out notices of their hiring decisions using e-mail.          However, when using e-mail to communicate in a professional environment,          you must make sure to format the e-mail in a professional manner. You          can format an e-mail in the same way that you would format a paper          business letter (refer to a writing manual if you need a refresher on          formal letter writing), but at the very least you should include an          appropriate greeting (Dear Mr./Ms.) and salutation (Sincerely). Also          remember to proofread your letter rather than relying totally on          spell-check to catch your mistakes.                      On the other hand, if you are absolutely          confident that you have the time, a professional looking letter sent          through the mail, either typed or handwritten on quality paper, is          highly recommended. Handwritten letters are particularly desirable          because they convey a personal touch that is rare these days, and is          thus usually appreciated.  However, if you have sloppy handwriting as I          do, stick to a typed letter. Also, do not forget to sign your letters!             What to say in          your thank you letter                     Thank you letters should be kept short,          a paragraph or two at most, because the majority of the people you send          your letters to will not want to take the time to read a longer letter.          It is perfectly fine to write a thank you letter that is only a few          sentences long. In this letter you can thank the individual for taking          the time to meet with you, let them know that you enjoyed learning about          their institution and its goals, and remind them that you remain very          interested in their position.                     If at all possible, try to personalize          the letters you are writing. When you meet with people during an          interview try to jot down their names and a unique fact about each          person, and then use those facts in your letters. For example, if one of          the committee members is currently in charge of developing their          library marketing plan, you can mention the marketing class you took          as an undergraduate in college.                       You can also use the thank you letter to          address something that you feel did not go well during the interview. If          the search committee had a concern about your candidacy, you can address          that in your letter by acknowledging their concern followed by an          explanation as to why this particular issue will not be a problem based          on evidence from your resume and past experiences. If you answered a          particular question poorly during your interview, it is also perfectly          fine to rethink your answer in a thank you letter and let the search          committee know that upon further consideration your answer has          changed/expanded.                     It is also a good idea to include a          sentence or two in your letter designed to sell yourself and remind the          search committee of your strengths as a candidate. However, you should,          if possible, base what you say on what was discussed during the          interview. Take notes during the interview, if you can, to make this          task easier. For example, if the search committee seemed to focus on the          web page design class you took during your graduate studies and the need          that their library has for someone with this skill set, you could          mention in your letter that you believe your experience in this area          would be a valuable asset to their library. Many people feel          uncomfortable promoting themselves in this manner. However,          self-marketing is a necessary skill to have in the professional world,          so it is probably a good idea to start practicing now. Just remember to          keep things short and simple! While advice columns for those in the          corporate or business world greatly stress the concept of selling          yourself, I don believe this is as important in the field of library          science as it is in other fields.                     Finally, in writing a thank you letter          you have the opportunity to open a dialog with one or more of the          individuals you send letters to by asking them a question in the letter          related to the job or to a topic that was discussed during your          interview. If you can keep this discussion going for a little while you          will have additional opportunities to connect with this individual and          to sell yourself to them. However, be careful not to overstay your          welcome by keeping the conversation going after the other person has          brought it to a close.            Remember:            Thank you letters should not only be          sent to prospective employers, but also to those individuals who have          helped you with your job search or acted as your references. Sending          letters to these individuals thanking them for their help after you have          found a job is professional courtesy, and it also helps to reinforce the          positive impression your references and friends have of you. Besides,          you may need the help of these individuals later on, so network while          you can and send them a thank you letter, and perhaps another letter          letting them know how you are doing in your new job after you have been          there for a little while.

clueweb09-en0009-82-01791	                Job Interview Thank You Letters  You should write a thank you letter as soon as possible (within 24 hours is recommended) after the job interview, at a minimum this should be done through email but is recommended that you do this through a hard-copy of a letter printed out of your computer which can be sent in through the postal mail or faxed in.  Hand written notes on thank you cards are also acceptable and good for short thank you notes.   A hard-copy thank you letter should be written in the  business letter format , while an email should be sent in the same format but without the heading (your return address, their address, and the date).    Thank you letter writing  The first paragraph should consist of thanking the interviewer for the interviewing you (remind him/her about the position you interviewed for and the date of your interview).   You can also include information about your impressions about the company.   The second paragraph should state your interests in the company and include any additional information about yourself that was not brought up in the interview which would make you a good candidate for the position.  You can also emphasize your qualifications that were already discussed during the interview (don't make this paragraph too long, try to keep it between 3-5 sentences, pick the traits that you think were most important to the interviewer and emphasize them).   The last paragraph should let the recruiter know that you expect to hear from them soon.  Also let them know that you are available to come in again and are willing to discuss the job further.  Write down your contact information again and what the best method and/or time to contact you is.  To finish up the letter, thank them again for the interview.    Notes/Tips   A thank you letter shows that you have good business etiquette, your interest in the company and the position, and reiterates your positive qualifications to the interviewer so it should not be put off.    If there was more than one interviewer; write individual thank you letters to each of the interviewers (make sure each letter is unique).  If it was a panel of interviewers interviewing you at the same time, you can send out one letter and address it to the head interviewer and the interview panel and thank them as one group.    If you forget the spelling or the names of the interviewers, simply call the company and request the proper spelling and title.    Keep the thank you letter brief; make sure the letter does not go past one page in length.    Check for proper grammar usage and spelling.

It is critical, but very few job seekers actually do it. What  is it? The THANK YOU NOTE! Interview  experts agree that EVERY job hunter MUST send thank-you notes after EVERY interview.  They also point out that most people completely ignore this bit of wisdom. In  order to have a huge advantage over the other candidates for the job you want,  send thank-you notes to EVERYONE you meet the day of the interview—administrative  assistants, managers, interviewers, people you met who already do the job you  are targeting, and so on. One  of my resume clients (let's call him Mike) is a Certified Arborist and Tree Care  Professional in the San Diego area. His goal is to move into the consulting arena. Very  soon after speaking on the phone with the owner of a prominent tree care company,  Mike mailed a brief note thanking the owner for his time and consideration. Within  a week, the owner called Mike and offered him an informal mentoring arrangement  to help Mike learn more about the consulting side of tree care.                   ""Sending a thank-you   note demonstrates that  you are good with people.   You employ the most   basic of people skills—a   show of gratitude...""            Mike  decided to pass on the offer and continue his job search, and he recently landed  a very nice position. He sent me an e-mail about his recent job-hunting activities  saying, ""...and just so you know, the thank-you letter has got to be the block  that keeps the door open. I sent out three letters and subsequently got three  offers."" If you're  not convinced yet, the following reasons outline the significance of sending thank-you  notes:  (1) Sending  a thank-you note demonstrates that you are good with people. You employ the most  basic of people skills—a show of gratitude. (2)  It helps companies remember you after the interview. You can restate your interest  in the position, especially if the interview went well. (3)  You can use the thank-you note to summarize a few of the main points discussed  at the interview. You can also add anything you forgot to tell them. (4)  It has the potential to increase your affinity with those who have the authority  to hire you. (5)  It shows that you are serious about your career design. (6)  It indicates that you are organized and on top of details. (7)  It demonstrates that you went out of your way to show interest in the company  and/or position. (8)  If they decide not to consider you for the position, perhaps they know of another  opportunity that suits you. You can mention this in the thank-you note, asking  them to keep you in mind. The  post-interview thank-you note doesn't have to be fancy. Here's an example: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Thank  you for the opportunity to speak with you today. As we discussed, my 10-years  of outside sales experience is a perfect fit for XYZ Widgets as you expand into  the Pacific Rim. In light of your plans for Asia, you?ll find my Japanese language  skills to be of great value. Feel  free to contact me at 555-1234 should you have additional questions. I am very  interested in the position. Thank  you again for your time and consideration.  Regards, Jane  Doe ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OK.  You now know the impact a thank-you note can have after an employment interview.  Are there other opportunities to send them? Absolutely!  The general rule is this: After  ANYONE has done you even the smallest favor during the job-hunt/career-design  process, send the individual a thank-you note. Was  a receptionist at a company you phoned while doing research exceptionally helpful?  Did one of your colleagues take five minutes to help you with a cover letter?  Did somebody who already does the job you want to do provide you with some valuable  insights? The job hunt can be frustrating. Was someone particularly encouraging? You  should send each of these individuals a brief hand-written thank-you note expressing  your gratitude for their time and assistance. To  reiterate: A thank-you note goes to everyone who helps you, gives you leads, or  provides advice or guidance even in the most infinitesimal way. That includes  friends, people at companies or organizations you've visited while doing your  research, temp agency personnel, administrative assistants, receptionists, librarians,  company employees...ANYONE! Here  are a few thank-you note guidelines: -  Address the note to the specific individual with which you spoke. Personalize  it. Avoid an obligatory, mechanical tone. Mention something about your conversation  or how the individual treated you. -  Thank-you notes following an interview should be printed out on quality stationery  with letterhead matching that of your resume. Remember to sign it!  -  A conservative, handwritten thank-you card is appropriate for all those friends,  colleagues, and casual contacts that have helped you along the way.  -  Send thank-you notes the very next day, at the latest. If it arrives a week later,  the meaning is lost. -  If you e-mail a sentiment of gratitude, follow up with a thank-you note or card  in the mail. Use  your best judgment—these are just guidelines. The  thank-you note is critical to your getting noticed and to the success of your  job hunt. And because most folks either forget or just plain don't do it, you'll  find yourself at a significant advantage.     About the Author...    Copyright Peter Hill, CPRW--Honolulu, Hawaii,  U.S.A.

Replace the phrase ""escalating costs"" with the phrase ""escalating pressure for cost control,"" and this description is fitting for most of the industrialized world. Firms are searching for any competitive edge they can get and cannot afford to allow any new competitive disadvantages. Therefore, increasing cultural diversity in world labor forces for the purpose of better organizational performance continues to receive great attention. When I first wrote about this subject seventeen years ago (Cox & Blake, 1991), it was scarcely mentioned in the business literature; today, even a casual investigation of published information will uncover hundreds of relevant articles.          Vortrag auf der Veranstaltung der Bertelsmann Stiftung  Synergie durch Vielfalt .  Download des Textes  hier This paper updates my thinking about the connections between workforce diversity and organizational performance. I have three main objectives:  (1) present the major arguments in support of organizational interventions to create and/or effectively manage diversity,  (2) briefly review some of the recent research on the relationship, and  (3) offer suggestions for tackling this subject in future research and in efforts of diversity management.   Arguments for a Diversity-Organizational Performance Link In a much earlier writing, Stacey Blake and I offered a framework featuring six ways in which effectivemanagement of diversity has the potential to create a competitive advantage for firms (Cox &Blake, 1991). I believe that - with some updates - the framework remains useful for classifying themain arguments. Exhibit 1 shows a summary of the major arguments.   Exhibit 1: Managing Diversity & Organizational Performance - The Major Arguments 1   Cost Argument   Given the reality of diversity in workgroups, failure to manage the special challenges that it presents may lead to higher cost structures for firms by contributing to higher employee turnover, higher interpersonal conflict, and more miscommunication.2    Resource Acquisition Argument   As sources of labor become increasingly diverse, firms that are able to hire, retain and effectively utilize workers from all social-cultural backgrounds may gain an advantage in human assets over firms that less effectively meet their diversity goals.   Marketing Argument   By tapping the insights and understanding of people of different cultures, genders, ethnic groups, etc., firms may gain advantages in designing and selling products and services to a culturally diverse marketplace.    Creativity Argument   Human diversity in workgroups creates a richer flow of ideas and thus has the potential to increase creativity and innovation; this, in turn, can improve organizational financial performance.   Problem-Solving Argument   Diverse perspectives create a potential for better problem solving in workforces that are culturally diverse. These advantages should be observable in recognizing and defining problems as well as in generating useful solutions.   Values Argument   Organizations seek to perform on a diverse set of measures, including integrity on stated core values such as fair and respectful treatment of all members and/or promotion of equal employment opportunities in the broader society. Firms must be proactive in managing diversity in order to honor these values.   Several observations and explanations about the arguments in Exhibit 1 are warranted: First,  the cost argument most clearly points out how critical it is to ""manage"" diversity. It assumes a presence of diversity in the workforce and tells us that failure to respond to this presence in insightful ways can lead to higher organizational costs. In evaluating the usefulness of this argument, it is wise to keep in mind that diversity occurs on so many dimensions that few organizations can realistically claim to have a workforce that is truly social-culturally homogeneous. Further, the dynamics of diversity that require attention in diversity-related organizational development interventions apply across types of diversity. Therefore, I argue that the management of diversity is a relevant challenge for virtually all firms. Second,  some of the arguments have selective applicability based on industry. For example, the marketing argument is most applicable to firms that sell products to end-users. Third,  although not based on the traditional measures of organizational performance, the values argument can be effective. Good leaders are highly principled people who take their responsibility for social welfare and integrity on stated organizational values very seriously. Such leaders often feel as a former Alcoa CEO does, who explained his desire to make diversity in the workforce a priority when he told me, ""I don't need a business case; this is the right thing to do for our workforce and for the business."" Review of Previous Research   While the theoretical arguments that indicate the potential of diversity and its effective management to create a competitive advantage for organizations are well publicized, empirical research relevant to the topic presents a somewhat confusing picture (e.g. Kossek, Lobel & Brown, 2006).    While a comprehensive review of relevant data on the diversity-performance relationship is beyond the scope of this paper, the paragraphs that follow will briefly review selected studies to give an overview of this body of work.   Two studies of gender diversity in large U.S. firms indicate positive effects of gender diversity on their financial performance, measured in return on equity and return on assets. (Cordeiro & Stites-Doe, 1997; Catalyst, 2004). But these positive effects may be based on a number of factors. It is therefore necessary to examine what specific dynamics might affect performance. For example, a study of gender-diverse and same-gender groups performing a radio assembly task revealed no performance differences between the two groups (Myaskovsky, Unikel & Dew, 2005). In this case, the nature of the task (i.e. simple and mostly physical) may be a relevant factor in the research of the latter. A more cognitive task might yield different results. In one of the more revealing recent studies that analyzed this idea, Bowers (2000) reviewed data from 13 studies involving a total of 2,258 people. The types of diversity included gender, personality and ability. Measures of performance included some combination of the quality, quantity and accuracy of teamwork. He concluded that although none of these types of diversity appeared to have significant direct effects on team performance, when the task to be performed was rated as highly difficult (complex), significant performance advantages occurred for the diverse groups compared to the homogeneous groups.   A different aspect of diversity relating to task is cited as an important consideration by Horwitz and Horwitz (2007). After reviewing 35 studies of team diversity conducted between 1985 and 2006, the authors conclude that ""task-related"" diversity (e.g. function or education) positively impacts team performance, whereas ""bio-demographic"" diversity (e.g. gender or ethnicity) does not. The measures of team performance included both the quality and quantity of work.   Similarly, a study of top management teams from 57 manufacturing companies revealed that ""jobrelevant"" diversity (in this case, diversity of education, work function, or tenure) appeared to improve financial performance, while age diversity did not. Also significant in the study is that the jobrelevant diversity only improved financial performance if there was a sufficient level of debate and participation in decision processes. The authors' very telling conclusion clearly points to the necessity of actively managing diversity:   "". for diversity to benefit a company's bottom line, there must be a process by which the positive aspects of diversity are brought to bear"" ( Simons & Hope-Pelled, 1999, p. 669).   The above statement is also supported by a research of Sargeant & Sue-Chan (2001): In their study of racioethnic diversity and group effectiveness, they found that diversity improved group efficacy - measured in the group members' own perception - as long as the group was able to maintain good cohesion. In this case, a process promoting group cohesion could be considered as an adequate measure of diversity management.   Whereas the studies mentioned so far investigated the effects of diversity of team-members to the group's own performance, a research on diversity in the field of education (Pitts 2005) examined the impact racioethnic diversity among teaching faculty has on student performance. Pitts found that diversity among teachers had a positive effect on two of three measures of student performance: standardized academic achievement tests and college aptitude tests (SAT). Yet, a third measure of student performance, drop-out rates, was negatively related to faculty diversity. Though further empirical support would be needed, these results - transferred to a business context - give support to the idea that a leadership team's diversity impacts their followers' performance.   The work of Richard Allen and colleagues (Allen, Dawson, Wheatley & White 2008) reveals insight into yet another aspect worth consideration. They examined the relationship between employee perceptions of diversity among managers and non-managers and perceptions of firm performance. Based on their analysis they report strong support for a positive relationship between perceptions of diversity and perceived performance. A practical implication that they draw from the study is that:   ""Organizations need to be sure they focus on initiatives that have a positive influence on employee perceptions of diversity within the ranks of senior managers and among non managers"" (Allen et al., 2008, p. 32).   This study suggests that organizational interventions that affect employee attitudes toward diversity may also affect - or at least be related to - attitudes towards firm performance. Although the value of this work is limited by a reliance on perceptual measures, what employees believe about their employers is certainly a determinant of employee behavior. Consequently, the management of perceptions is worthy of constant attention by organizational leaders.   This review of a sample of the recent work points to several considerations: Different dimensions of diversity (e.g. age, gender, race, education, etc.) seem to have a different degree of impact on performance, depending on the specific situational conditions (e.g. nature of the task at hand); diversity's positive effects can be tapped by providing supportive processes, i.e. measures of diversity management; both the factual degree of diversity and the subjectively perceived diversity seem to influence performance, so both deserve attention.   Suggestions for Future Work   The existing research makes it clear that the relationship between workforce diversity and organizational performance is complex. Further research is necessary not only because the findings are somewhat inconsistent, but also because there is still room to examine diversity and performance while integrating the findings of related fields of research, such as organizational culture and organizational change; such an integrative approach will help to better understand the influence of subjective perception and the function of values.   The following advice for future research and diversity-related organizational development interventions seems warranted:     Maintain a broad view of the measures of organizational performance    Recognize the legitimacy and power of social responsibility and honoring of core values as criteria for investing in diversity related organization change    Distinguish appropriately between diversity and managing diversity    Pay close attention to nuances in the relationship, specifically: - the type of diversity - the type of industry - the task to be performed.   Each of these points will be briefly discussed:   Maintain a Broad View of the Measures of Organizational Performance   One of the most important considerations in developing research or organizational intervention projects related to cultural diversity is the definition of performance measures. A wide range of measures are potentially appropriate, including employee satisfaction and turnover, creativity and innovation, success in hiring the best available talent (e.g. % of first-choice job offers that are accepted), market share, promotion of equal employment policies, honoring organizational values, worker productivity, return on investment, and many others. Each of these measures has a place in the definition of performance, but the priority attached to them depends a great deal on how the leadership and owners of individual firms view their organization's mission and how they prioritize the interests of the various constituencies to which they feel some responsibility.   Sorting out these priorities involves determining ""the unit of analysis"" - that is, whether one is interested in outcomes of work at the individual, work-group or organizational level. The term ""organizational performance"" can be construed as including measurements at all three levels of analysis, depending, as was suggested earlier, on how the organization defines its goals and responsibilities.   My experiences suggest that the closer one is to measuring outcomes at the individual level, the stronger the link between diversity (i.e. the impact of being culturally different) or of managing diversity and organizational performance. The link weakens somewhat as we move to the group- outcome level of analysis and still more as we move to strictly organizational metrics link ROI. But this erosion of impact on performance as one moves toward organizational outcomes does not imply overall weakness in the diversity-performance relationship. Instead, it recognizes that organizational outcomes like ROI are determined by many more factors than individual or even work group outcomes.   The Legitimacy of Social Responsibility and Value Integrity as Criteria Much of the published work on the relationship between workforce diversity and organizational performance focuses on strict financial indicators such as return on sales, return on assets, or return on investment. I think this is unfortunate. To the extent that organizational leaders view social responsibility goals, employee welfare, and integrity on core values (such as workplace fairness and universal respect) as legitimate measures of organizational effectiveness, the ""business case"" for managing diversity takes on a broader and (some would argue) deeper meaning. My advice to leaders is not to sell these ""softer"" indicators of firm performance short. For example, where fairness and employee welfare are core values, data such as that shown in Table 1, taken from a German subsidiary of a U.S. based company, are valid and should be included among the measures of organizational performance.   Table 1: Data on Employee Perceptions of the Work Climate 3                 agree / strongly agree               Germans    Non Germans     There is tension & conflict here between Germans & non Germans    15 %     50 %       Employees who are not German are  often assumed to have limited  abilities or negative traits based on their cultural identity    15 %     55 %     I have personally experienced an incident of ethnic harassment  at this firm in the last 24 months    2 %      27 %                         Men     Women     The procedures for promotions  here are fair     42 %     25 %     I like my current job well     74 %     42 %       Reducing gaps in attitude toward the organization and reported work experiences such as those in Table 1 is a tangible, hard-data, organizational performance achievement. Both employees and customers like to identify with firms that show integrity and demonstrate a concern for worker welfare and a willingness to address, at some level, the challenges of the societies in which they operate.   Distinguish Between Diversity & Managing Diversity   Another step toward improving both research and organizational interventions related to the diversity- performance link is to recognize the distinction between the implications of diversity as a characteristic of the workforce and the organization's response to this presence (""managing"" diversity). This advice has several applications:   First, to the extent that cultural diversity is an organizational reality and not a matter of choice by organizational decision makers, much of our focus needs to be on how organizations can develop an environment in which diversity can thrive rather than becoming a potential drag on performance.   Second, and related to the above, analysis that examines the impact of cultural diversity in work teams or organizations on group and organizational outcomes must take into account the level of effectiveness in managing that diversity. If diversity is present and the environment for it is favorable, one can predict a positive impact of diversity. If diversity is present but the environment for it is not favorable, a negative impact of diversity on performance may be expected. It is therefore the interaction of diversity and the environment for diversity that actually determines the performance impact. Failure to look at these factors together is a frequent mistake.    For example, some firms focus entirely on changing the demographic profile of new hires while giving the climate for diversity inside the firm little or no attention. As a second example, much of the research on diversity and performance examines levels of heterogeneity and task outcomes in workgroups without regard to the diversity-competence of members or the processes that allow diversity to inform group tasks.   Still another important application of this advice is that the amount of diversity and the extent to which people identify with various social-cultural group memberships-both of which are aspects of the term ""workforce diversity""-have a great influence on managing diversity efforts. For example, part of the managing diversity effort is to deal with differences of culture between incoming members and the existing culture of the organization. This acculturation process is greatly affected by the types of cultural diversity that are brought into the firm. Among other aspects, the amount of cultural distance that has to be addressed varies widely depending on the specific cultural backgrounds of the entering members.   By paying strict attention to these implications of the distinction between diversity and managing diversity, we can improve our work with regard to the diversity-performance relationship. Exhibit 2 summarizes major factors involved in managing diversity to create a positive diversity climate.   Exhibit 2: Factors of Diversity Climate Requiring Attention in Managing Diversity Efforts4   Individual / Intergroup Factors     Prejudice    Stereotyping    Ethnocentrism    Personality types (e.g. authoritarianism)    Inter-group conflict    Cultural differences   Organizational / Institutional Factors     Organizational culture    Mode of acculturation (e.g. assimilation vs. pluralism)    Distribution of authority/power    Level of integration in informal networks    Human resource policies & practices   Attend to Differences of Diversity, Industry, and Task   A clear message of the recent research on the diversity-performance link is that we must give consideration to specific forms of diversity, type of industry, and type of task, as well as the interrelationships among these factors. Several specific questions that seem especially critical are:     In what way/s is the type of diversity at issue in the group or organization relevant to the task or type of work to be performed?    Is the industry one in which employees interface directly with the broader society?    Are the products/services of the organization designed for sale to end-users?    What is the diversity-profile of the important external constituencies of the organization (e.g. customers, suppliers, government regulators)?   One clarification regarding the first question is that ""organizational tasks"" should also include those that may go beyond tasks that derive directly from the main mission of the organization. They should include important auxiliary tasks such as resolving employee problems and maintaining high quality public relations.   Accurate answers to questions such as these will add a great deal of value to our understanding of the diversity-performance connections for a particular group or organization.   Conclusion In summary, the material presented in this paper confirms that the relationship between workforce diversity and organizational performance is complex. In spite of this complexity, several conclusions seem appropriate:     There are a variety of ways in which the presence of cultural diversity can impact organizational performance    When nuances such as the breadth of organizational performance measures, the type of diversity, the type of industry, and the nature of the tasks to be performed are properly taken into account, there is a significant amount of evidence that diversity can enhance organizational performance.    In order to avoid possible performance losses and reap performance benefits of workforce diversity, organizations must create an effective climate for diversity (i.e. manage diversity well).   While debate will no doubt continue on whether and under what circumstances cultural diversity offers net value to firms, there can be no debate about the importance of the effective management of diversity. Some believe that through sustained and enlightened steps to create a diversitywelcoming organizational culture, firms will realize new opportunities of growth and prosperity.    Others believe simply that since human diversity is an inevitable characteristic of workforces, the failure to proactively manage diversity leads to performance losses. Many are convinced that both these conclusions are true. Regardless of where one lines up on this philosophical spectrum, the effort to understand and promote diversity-friendly organizations will remain a priority for all insightful leaders.

Family, friends, career, home, entertainment...it all jumbles together to keep us rushing breathlessly from one thing to the next, with hardly a moment to breath in between. When we do relax, we often spend our time watching television, or some other activity that doesn't always leave us feeling energized for the next task at hand.                           I'm Judy Camp. I work full time as a marketing director for a mid-size advertising agency, plus run a home business, and still have time for family, writing books and articles and home projects. How do I do it? Through the techniques and strategies I've outlined in my book,  Time for What You Love . Out of sheer frustration with trying to juggle so many things at once, I stopped and spent three years researching all of the leading experts on subjects like time management, empowerment, getting organized, being productive and several other related topics. This book has condensed all of this research in an easy-to-read format that allows you to finally do what I did, use your precious time to focus on the life you really want! Wouldn't it be great to find several more hours in every day that you can spend any way you want...with people who make you happy, on hobbies, on entertainment or sports...or whatever make us feel good?                                                                                                                             Order Now!             Often we are so caught up in our lives we aren't even sure what would make us happy anymore, and we spend most of our time feeling led by the nose, merely fulfilling obligations, rather than feeling in control of our time.                          If you are like most people, you have probably become somewhat disconnected from your dreams, or to your image of an ideal life. You may feel you have jumped on a hamster wheel, and don't have time to stop and think about what you would really like to do with your time.                          But what if you were able to reconnect with the person inside you who longs for happiness and contentment, then begin to go after the things you need to attain that happiness? Imagine it.             It's really a three-part equation:                             1. Find extra time in every day.                2. Get in touch with the things that will make you happy, and will make your life feel complete.                3. Make the necessary changes in your life to make it happen.                           I'm going to provide you with all the tools you need to get to that place where your life is the one you truly want. Imagine it.                             You can have--                             * Time for fun                * Time for family                * Time for relaxation and entertainment                * Time to make extra money, if you choose to                * Time to enjoy life                * Time for whatever makes you happy                           You'll be able to fill in the blanks yourself, since we are all different, and what makes us happy isn't always the same.  Time for What You Love  is a book that can change your life for the better, and will finally help you achieve that life you always wished you had. You will be able to do more than imagine that life, once you read the book.                          Skip to the Order                           You will:                * Find out how being overly helpful can keep you from reaching your goals, and may make others around you weaker, rather than stronger.                * Discover how to use your time as an investment in your future, which will pay off for years to come.                * Identify and toss off useless duties that have become second nature to you, but don't really help you or anyone else achieve anything.                * Change the structure of your life for the better, including how you relate to family and friends, in a way that supports your goals and leaves everyone happier.                * Begin to fuel your energy level, to streamline your time for the greatest effect.                * Enhance your enjoyment of relaxation time for the greatest fun and benefit.                           But there is a whole lot more. This book is so much more than just a time management book, which normally focuses on ways to get organized. Sure, the book does that, but the secret to getting organized is to start with what is most important to you, and rearrange your priorities for the greatest benefit. The more you understand just how valuable this book will be to you, the less you will think about delaying this important purchase.

Both ""Getting Things Done"" and ""GTD"" are registered trademarks of the David Allen Company. [ 1 ]   GTD rests on the principle that a person needs to move tasks out of the mind by recording them externally. That way, the mind is freed from the job of remembering everything that needs to be done, and can concentrate on actually performing those tasks. By thus relying on external memories, GTD can be seen as an application of the scientific theories of  distributed cognition  or the  extended mind .  [ 2 ] .

[ 1 ]  In traditional  time management , priorities usually play a central role. In contrast, Allen promotes two key elements in his version of time management   control  and  perspective . Allen advocates three major models for gaining control and perspective:     A workflow process   A framework with 6 levels of focus   A natural planning method     The first major model is the  workflow process , which is used to gain control over all the tasks and commitments which one needs or wants to get done. [ 3 ]  The workflow process consists of five distinct phases listed below (with each described in greater details in the  Principles  section):     Collect   Process   Organize   Review   Do     Allen uses an altitude analogy to illustrate his second major model,  6 different levels of focus , and give perspective on tasks and commitments. These 6 levels of focus, from the bottom up, are: [ 3 ] :51     Current actions   Current projects   Areas of responsibility   Yearly goals   5 year vision   Life goals     As one ascends in altitude, one is able to consider the ""bigger picture."" Considering projects, actions, unfinished business or commitments (""open loops"" in GTD terminology [ 4 ] ), and other ""input"" from a variety of ""heights"" gives one varying perspective.   Allen advocates a weekly review focused on different levels. The perspective gained from these reviews should drive one's priorities, which in turn determines the priority of if and when one is to do the particular individual tasks and commitments gathered during the workflow process. During a weekly review, the user determines the context for the tasks and puts them on the appropriate lists. Examples of grouping together similar tasks include making a list of telephone calls to make or errands to do while downtown. Context lists can be defined by the set of tools available or by the presence of individuals or groups for whom one has items to discuss or present.   Allen expects that the first two models are sufficient most of the time to gain control and perspective on the majority of tasks and projects. However, there are some cases in which more involved planning and thinking are necessary. [ 3 ] :54  This leads to the third major model, which is the  natural planning method . While the workflow model has a ""horizontal"" focus on doing individual tasks, the natural planning method has a ""vertical"" focus on planning projects and thinking through topics. The planning model consists of 5 stages:     Defining the purpose and principles   Envisioning the outcome   Brainstorming   Organizing   Identifying next actions     GTD is based on making it easy to store, track and retrieve all information related to the things that need to get done. Allen suggests that many of the mental blocks we encounter are caused by insufficient 'front-end' planning (i.e., for any project we need to clarify what is to be achieved and what specific actions are needed to achieve it). It is most practical, according to Allen, to do this thinking in advance, generating a series of actions which we can later undertake without any further planning.   Allen contends that our mental ""reminder system"" is inefficient and seldom reminds us of what we need to do at the time and place that we can do it. Consequently, the ""next actions"" stored by context in the ""trusted system"" act as an external support which ensures that we are presented with the right reminders at the right time.   A capsule description of GTD from Allen's book  Ready for Anything :          Get everything out of your head. Make decisions about actions required on stuff when it shows up  not when it blows up. Organize reminders of your projects and the next actions on them in appropriate categories. Keep your system current, complete, and reviewed sufficiently to trust your intuitive choices about what you're doing (and not doing) at any time.            [ edit ]   Principles   The core principles of GTD are:     [ edit ]   Collect   The notion of  stress-free productivity  starts with off-loading what needs to get done from one's head, capturing everything that is necessary to track, remember, or take action on, into what Allen calls a  bucket : a physical inbox, an email inbox, a tape recorder, a notebook, a PDA, a desktop, etc. The idea is to get everything out of one's head and into a collection device, ready for processing. All buckets should be emptied (processed) at least once per week.   Allen doesn't advocate any preferred collection method, leaving the choice to the individual. He only insists upon the importance of emptying the ""buckets"" regularly. Any storage space (physical inbox, email inbox, tape recorder, notebook, PDA, etc.) that is processed regularly by the individual is acceptable.     [ edit ]   Process   When processing a bucket, a strict workflow is followed:     Start at the top.   Deal with one item at a time.   Never put anything back into 'in'.   If an item requires action:           Do it (if it takes less than two minutes), OR   Delegate it, OR   Defer it.           If an item does not require action:           File it for reference, OR   Throw it away, OR   Incubate it for possible action later.         If it takes under two minutes to do something, it should be done immediately. The two-minute rule is a guideline, encompassing roughly the time it would take to formally defer the action.     [ edit ]   Organize   Allen describes a suggested set of lists which can be used to keep track of items awaiting attention:     Next actions   For every item requiring attention, decide what is the next action that can be physically taken on that item. For example, if the item is, ""Write project report,"" the next action might be, ""Email Fred for meeting minutes,"" or, ""Call Mary to ask about report requirements."" Though there may be many steps and actions required to complete the item, there will always be something that needs to be done  first,  and this step should be recorded in the next actions list. Preferably, these steps are organized by the context in which they can be done, such as ""in the office,"" ""by the phone,"" or ""at the store.""   Projects   Every  open loop  in one's life or work which requires more than one physical action to achieve becomes a  project . These projects are tracked and periodically reviewed to make sure that every project has a next action associated with it, and thus can be moved forward.   Waiting for   When an action has been delegated to someone else, or when one is waiting for some external event before a project can be moved forward, this is tracked in the system and periodically checked to see if action is due, or a reminder needs to be sent.   Someday/Maybe   Things to be done at some point, but not right now. Examples might be ""learn Chinese,"" or, ""take diving holiday.""     A calendar is important for keeping track of appointments and commitments; however, Allen specifically recommends that the calendar be reserved for the  hard landscape : things which absolutely have to be done by a particular deadline, or meetings and appointments which are fixed in time and place. To-do items should be reserved for the next action lists.   A final key organizing component of GTD is the filing system. A filing system must be easy, simple and fun. Even a single piece of paper, if needed for reference, should get its own file if it doesn't belong in an existing folder. Allen suggests a single, alphabetically organized filing system, in order to make it as quick and easy as possible to store and retrieve the needed information.     [ edit ]   Review   The lists of actions and reminders will be of little use if not reviewed at least daily, or whenever possible. Given the time, energy and resources available at a particular moment, one must decide the most important task to be done immediately, and do it. If one is inclined to  procrastinate , one may end up always doing the easy tasks and avoiding the difficult ones. To solve this, one can decide to do the actions of the list one by one, following their order, just like processing an inbox.   At least weekly, the discipline of GTD requires that all outstanding actions, projects and 'waiting for' items are reviewed, making sure that any new tasks or forthcoming events are entered into one's system, and that everything is up to date. Allen suggests the creation of a "" tickler file "" in order to help refresh one's memory each week with the outstanding tasks and projects.     [ edit ]   Do   Any organizational system is no good if excessive time is spent organizing tasks instead of actually doing them. Allen's contention is that if one can make it simple, easy, and fun to take the necessary actions, one will be less inclined to procrastinate or become overwhelmed with too many 'open loops'.     [ edit ]   Tools and techniques     [ edit ]   Tickler file       Main article:  Tickler file              A slice of '43 Folders'       One device that Allen suggests is the  tickler file  for organizing paperwork (also known as the '43 folders'). Twelve folders are used to represent each month and an additional 31 folders are used to represent each day. The folders are arranged to help remind the user of activities to be done that day.     [ edit ]   Software tools for GTD    While Allen has shown that GTD can be managed with simple paper tools, software was specifically suggested by Allen as helpful and important for implementing GTD, including digital outlining, brainstorming, and project planning applications. However, in 2001, Allen bemoaned the general lack of ""good 'project management' tools,"" concluding:     ... less structured and more functional applications will emerge in the coming years, based on the ways we naturally think and plan. [ 3 ] :219-221     Since that prediction, a virtual explosion of GTD-supporting software has emerged; in April 2008, more than 100 applications provided the core features for implementing  Getting Things Done . [ 5 ]  These tools now range from simple list managers to collaborative web services, both free and commercial, for all popular platforms and devices. Much of this software specifically automates or reinforces the GTD methodology of collecting, processing, organizing, reviewing, and doing.     [ edit ]   Other tools   Some followers of GTD advocate a 'back-to-basics' approach to personal management, and a rejection of over-engineered, high-tech solutions in favor of simple, less-expensive tools such as preprinted cards, index cards, [ 6 ]  the  Hipster PDA , or even the  Moleskine  paper pad. [ 7 ]  David Allen himself says he relies on a ""vanilla""  Palm PDA  and records ""events of the day"" on paper to be processed later. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Reception   In 2005,  Wired  called GTD ""A new cult for the info age"", [ 9 ]  describing the enthusiasm for this methodology among  Information Technology  and  knowledge workers  as a kind of  cult following . Allen's ideas have also been popularized through the  Internet , especially via  blogs  such as  Lifehacker , [ 10 ]   43 Folders , [ 11 ]  and The Simple Dollar. [ 12 ]   In 2005,  Ben Hammersley  interviewed David Allen for  The Guardian , with an article called ""Meet the man who can bring order to your universe"", [ 13 ]  saying ""For me, as with the hundreds of thousands around the world who press the book into their friends' hands with fire in their eyes, Allen's ideas are nothing short of life-changing.""   In 2007,  Time Magazine  called  Getting Things Done  the self-help business book of its time, [ 14 ]  a contrast to the notion that GTD has only a niche following of zealous enthusiasts. [ citation needed ]   In 2007,  Wired  ran another article about GTD and Allen, [ 15 ]  quoting him as saying ""the workings of an automatic transmission are more complicated than a manual transmission, [t]o simplify a complex event, you need a complex system."" The author of the article,  Gary Wolf , dug into the roots of GTD, covering Allen's stay in a mental hospital and his encounters with several New Age gurus, including Sri  John-Roger  who created the  Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness , in whose church Allen is still a minister.

By  Nathan F. Shaw   Organized Living  draws from every area of life to give an efficient approach to everything. Daunting? Not in the least.   We must ask the question: What is Organized Living? What does Organized Living look like? What would it really be like to get, be and stay truly organized?   What would your ideal organized lifestyle include? What are your own specific results right now for your health, security, wealth, intelligence, relationships, and career?   If things were a little more organized in each of those areas for you, what better results would you get in life? If you improved our degree of organized living by say 10%, what dramatic effects would it have on all areas of your life. Organized Living effects everythign of course. (You don't need to spend long on this question to so easily appreciate that being organized is a big key to success)   Of course its vital for organized living to learn how to get organized. My clients start off their approach to organized living by dividing life into three key areas to start off with: Work, Home and Personal life.   From there we now have the basis on which to actually learn how to get organized for total organized living. Organizing the home, getting organized at work, and having an organized social life can seem like great big obstacles. And using typical old-style techniques and tips for getting organized, the obstacles are near impossible to overcome.   Practical steps for organized living you can immediately take are to break those 3 areas of organized living into their own separate 'departments'.   Once my organized living clients have got those 3 areas broken down into what they want for each of them, I then help them with a full list of the 7 factors for how to get organized in all areas of your life.   The 7 sections of the physical realm for organized living are: Personal, People, Health, Environment, Occupation, Security, and Financial. Lets take a quick look at them.   Environment is about where you go and where you stay. A big area to organize home is garage organization. Another would be storage solutions inside the home.   Occupation is about career development, creative projects and of course getting organized at work. Getting organized at work might for you include office furniture, organizing files on computer and what about that email! Yes organized living involves a lot of work. But its worth it!   Security includes physical and economic safety. Financial includes building wealth, investments and financial planning. The Personal section includes your lifestyle choices, purpose, direction and gadgets you buy. For People you include influence or communication skills for your various relationships. Health of course is about your physical vitality, including diet, exercise, etc.   You get the point right? Organized living comes from breaking down the practical areas of life helps you gradually (or sometimes rapidly) achieve an organized lifestyle.   By creating projects of organized living for each of these 7 factors, you can make rapid progress to organize your life..   To finish this off about organized living, consider how organized living compares to goal setting? You can set goals right? Yet without being organized goals are disheartening aren't they? Setting is not achieving.   Organized living means being successful& Being successful comes from organized living& Where organization is poor, so are the results we get from life. Goals depend on being organized, but people often neglect getting organized, so how can they expect to really achieve their goals?   Forget goal setting. Achieve organized living through getting organized. And start off by using the 7 factors Ive given you of organized living.               Nathan Shaw has provided his Organized Living Matrix Free to visually explore the many facets of what it takes to have an organized lifestyle.

Gaining Top Management Support for Diversity Programs  (Repeated Tuesday at 3:00 p.m.)                   Workplace Application: This program will provide an in-depth analysis of successful strategies for obtaining buy in from top management for a diversity program.                                Support and buy in of top management is critical for the success of any diversity program.  In order to successfully gain support a diversity advocate must be supportive of the organization's mission, knowledgeable about the benefits of diversity, aware of the perceived risks of ill-considered diversity programs and prepared to discuss business analysis such as ROI.  Top management may also require data as well as anecdotal evidence of the benefits of diversity.  Attempting to implement or impose diversity programs without the support of top management is likely to lead to frustration on all sides.  Gaining top management support is best accomplished with a strategic plan and proposed processes to support that plan.                                     Presenter: Maria E.

Yet without white men's involvement, most diversity efforts in organizations won't take over the long term.  This session will examine what makes it hard for white men to be more visible and engage and will challenge you to look at your own assumptions and how you invite and/or limit white male engagement.                                     Presenter: Tim McNichol, managing partner, White Men as Full Diversity Partners, Portland, Ore.

Employers today are asking how they can get the four generations now in the workplace to collaborate to reach positive results.  This session will assist you with understanding the connection between age, other dimensions of diversity and productivity.  Particular attention will be focused on how race and age shape employee outlook.  We will examine how historical events have influenced both the approach to work as well as the meaning that employees attach to it.

Workplace diversity initiatives are not given priority at many organizations. Most often, unless there is a crisis or attention-grabbing PR debacle, workplace diversity sometimes lacks a champion from the company's senior leadership. How does your company stack up in comparison to other companies when it comes to diversity initiatives? What are the typical diversity-related activities across organizations? What's the outlook for the future of workplace diversity? Walk away with data that will reveal what companies are doing and saying, and learn 10 strategies to make your business case for more workplace diversity initiatives with more support from your leadership.

How to Avoid a ""One-Size-Fits-All"" Diversity Failure                   Workplace Application: This presentation will give you a practical approach to refining, relating and exporting an existing diversity strategy to other countries.                            With increasing globalization, international corporations and their subsidiaries are increasingly being asked by shareholders, clients and the public to uphold the same level of ethics and diversity policies in foreign nations and cultures.  It is not so simple as to export your head-office developed programs to international offices.  This session will explore the essentials of taking diversity strategies global; ensuring your training and policy development translates across boundaries and cultures.

The disability community is the largest minority market in the country, surpassing the Hispanic population by 5%.  From recruiting and training to benefits guidance, affinity groups, corporate websites, educational information and firm-wide communications and events, employees who have a disability or who have a child or other dependent with special needs require unique understanding, support and an overall feeling of inclusion from everyone if the organization.  This session will clearly illustrate how to accomplish that.

Do you have one yet? Is it comprehensive - including your Change Implementation Strategy? Is it integrated with the organization's business plan?  Are the recruiting, retention, learning and leadership competency development components apparent? Is it quantifiable, according to your CEO's standards?  Your diversity focus is incomplete without one.  Your organization cannot achieve a level of breakthrough performance absent the diversity strategic plan.  Come prepared with your organization's top three strategic objectives and let's write.  This session is guaranteed to produce a strategy tool you can employ immediately.                                          Presenter: Grace A.

Measure Inclusion, Not Diversity           Workplace Application: You will be empowered with three new, practical tools for developing diversity strategies, measuring progress, and holding managers responsible.                                    As diversity managers, we commonly measure and monitor the diversity of an employer's workforce when we really to measure the inclusiveness of the employer's workplace culture and employment practices.  Incorrect measurement, in turn, leads us toward unproductive efforts to manage diversity symptoms rather than cure underlying inclusion problems.  Through practical examples from major employers, this workshop presents three innovative techniques for measuring and monitoring workplace inclusion.

Declining birth rate.  Shortage of skilled labor.  Aging baby boomers with experience and skill and the desire and/or need to continue working.  This confluence of events creates a perfect storm either in terms of opportunity or disaster.   Embrace and thrive or exclude and pay the price. This session focuses on the business realities relative to the graying of the workforce, legal risks associated with managing an older work force and practical suggestions for attracting and retaining older workers.   Particular attention is paid to conscious and unconscious bias with regard to hiring and promotion decisions as well as layoff and discharge decisions.

Uncommon Threads: Managing Four Generations at Work                   Workplace Application: You will learn about the different values of four generations, and what managers can do to create a corporate culture that can attract a generation who ""lease"" their talents to the organization, while they seek to retain a generation who grew up with loyalty and now seek a different contract.                                Start with a game…move to a generational quiz…laugh at some clever generational commercials and film clips and take a live journey out on to the virtual world of SecondLife to see how you will learn about diversity and inclusion in the future.  This interactive presentation is based on TheFutureWork Institute's recent research on the future workplace and four generations at work in North America, Europe and Asia.  Focus groups and surveys were conducted in these countries which helped us establish some ""demo-trends"" that cross generations in many countries: the new elderly, the re-wired boomers, the global nomads and the net-gens.  The results will entertain you while also leaving you with ideas on how to manage and motivate each generational group.

Breaking down physical and communication barriers by creating inclusive policies, procedures and practices is giving persons with disabilities increasing opportunities to enter and become more successful in today's workforce.  However, attitudinal barriers can still make it difficult to recruit and retain those who are perceived to be different.  This interactive session will speak to some common misconceptions and how increased awareness and focusing on ability can create a truly inclusive workforce.

Support and buy in of top management is critical for the success of any diversity program.  In order to successfully gain support a diversity advocate must be supportive of the organization's mission, knowledgeable about the benefits of diversity, aware of the perceived risks of ill-considered diversity programs and prepared to discuss business analysis such as ROI.  Top management may also require data as well as anecdotal evidence of the benefits of diversity.  Attempting to implement or impose diversity programs without the support of top management is likely to lead to frustration on all sides.  Gaining top management support is best accomplished with a strategic plan and proposed processes to support that plan.      Presenter: Maria E.

The $64 Billion Revolving Door                   Workplace Application: You will discover specific reasons why people of color, gays/lesbians, and women actually leave the workplace so that they can craft effective strategies tailored to each group.                            The 2007 Corporate Leavers Survey revealed that employers lose $64 billion yearly from professionals and managers who leave solely due to unfairness.  One-size-fits-all diversity and retention strategies don't capture what drives out people of color versus gays/lesbians versus women.  Corporate Leavers also discourage prospective customers and employees, further impacting the bottom line.  Dr. Klein weaves rigorous data with stories of why top talent left and what would have kept them.

The four generations (Traditionalist, Baby Boomer, Gen X and Gen Y) demonstrate different behaviors and expectations in the workplace.  In order to fully engage each cohort, organizations have to acknowledge the differences, and respond by demonstrating organizational engagement.  We highlight the generational characteristics and discuss how generational behaviors and expectations impact your ability to get, keep and grow all for generations.  Demonstrating organizational engagement allows organizations to build and execute win-win strategies for all four generations.

Twenty-first century leaders will not survive within this paradigm — demographics have changed; the world is flat; the workforce has shrunk; and hierarchical corporate structures are inefficient and outdated.  Leaders must move beyond diversity management into ""Diversity Leadership.""  You must authentically embody competencies that display cultural acuity.  Only then can you inspire, lead and fully utilize the most diverse workforce in world history.

In this section there is a sample thank you                          note as well a information concerning thank you notes.              Post Job Interview Thank You Notes    by   ResumeEdge.com  - The Net's Premier Resume Writing and Editing Service                    Companies differ in their expectation of a thank you note after an interview. In some offices, interviewers take offense at the absence of a note and malign negligent interviewees. In other offices,                          politeness is a superfluous rather than central part of                          the culture. Rather than spending your time deciphering                          the expectations of your interviewers, invest in making                          the thank you note clinch your candidacy.                            You should consider the content of your thank you                          letter as carefully as you considered the content of                          your cover letter.                           In addition to showing appreciation for the time                          of the interviewer and establishing another point of                          contact, your thank you letter should include a                          reaffirmation of your particular value to the company                          now that you have more information about the job. Use                          the note to market yourself. By referencing specific                          concerns and needs of the company as expressed by the                          interviewer, you show the interviewer again that you                          paid close attention to what she said. By citing                          particular ways in which you can address those needs and                          concerns, you do the work of connecting the job                          requirements with your job skills. Making connections                          between yourself and the job not only fortifies your                          aptness for the position, but it also tangibly                          demonstrates your interest in the position. The greater                          care you take to customize the note, the more personally                          it will affect the interviewer. For this reason, it is                          also helpful to comment on something specific that you                          appreciated about the interviewer or what she said.                          (Note: be sure that your comments are appropriate and                          professional.)

Diversity Recruiting in a Failure:  It's Time to Raise The Bar    by Dr. John Sullivan & Dr. Sally Baack     There are very few companies that want to talk about it in public but it's time to face the facts. No matter how sincere the effort, diversity recruiting programs (DRP) time and time again have failed to meet their goals! When you speak to senior executives about diversity recruiting they are almost always universally disappointed in the results produced by their programs.  Even diversity program managers, the people that design and administer the programs, are disappointed in the results of their corporate diversity recruiting efforts. Why is diversity recruiting, one of the most important HR programs, failing? There are a variety of reasons why diversity recruiting is largely ineffective, almost all of which can be remedied.

In the aggregate, only about 5 percent of those looking for jobs perform this simple yet crucial ritual.  Thus, it's time to address some of the frequently asked questions about thank-you letters.    Doesn't it come off as wimpy or even desperate to send a thank-you letter? Won't the employer think  I'm sucking up?    No. It's a very rare employer who isn't pleased to get a thank-you letter. Most consider it just common  courtesy, a way to differentiate you from the pack, proof that you're really interested in the position,  and a way to keep your name in front of them.     Will a thank-you note make or break my chances of getting a job?  Well, probably not in most cases, but it could. Why take the chance? One of my former  students told me that after he was hired for his first job out of college, his boss  told him that he had wavered between my student and another finalist for the position.  But then the boss got a thank-you letter from my student, and it made all the difference.  Because of that simple gesture, my student got the job.    Should it be a typed business letter or a handwritten social note?  Studies show it doesn't matter. The important thing is doing it. Tailor your letter to the  culture of the company and the relationship you established with the person who interviewed you.  If you feel the interviewer and the company call for a formal business letter, send that.  If your rapport with the interviewer dictate a more personal touch, send a handwritten note.    What about an e-mailed thank you?  Career experts are not in total agreement about the propriety of e-mailing a thank you,  but again, the company's culture should guide you. If people in the company use e-mail  heavily, your e-mailed thank you will seem right in step.  It's also a fast solution if  you know the company will be making its hiring decision quickly. Even if e-mail fits in  with the company culture, however, it's a good idea to follow up your e-mailed thank you  with a hard-copy version.    So, if ""just do it"" is the byword, I don't have to put that much effort into it,  right?  Wrong. We've heard of candidates on the verge of being hired getting suddenly discounted  from consideration because they sent sloppy, poorly written thank-you letters, riddled  with typos, misspellings, and grammatical errors. Writing skills are important in many  jobs, and employers don't want to have to teach candidates remedial skills. Spellcheck,  proofread, and have someone else read over your letter before you send it.    Can I just borrow a sample thank-you letter from a book and adapt it to my  interviewer?  Well, ""borrowing"" is one thing. In fact we've provided some   sample  interview thank-you letters  to show what thank-you letters should look like. But be sure to borrow  just the basic structure, and perhaps a few key phrases; don't plagiarize the whole thing.  We know of one employer who instantly recognized that a thank-you letter he received had  been taken word for word from a text he was familiar with.    If I interview with several people, do I have to send a thank you to each one?  That's the best approach. You can make it essentially the same letter to each, but  vary at least a sentence or two to individualize the letters in case your recipients compare notes.    How soon after your interview should you send a thank-you?  The rule of thumb is to send it within 24 hours of the interview.    Should I bother with a thank-you note if I know the hiring decision will probably  be made sooner than I can mail a thank-you letter?  The key word here is ""mail.""  If mail is too slow for the hiring decision, find a faster  way: e-mail, fax, air-express, or hand-delivery. In fact, if the interview was local,  hand-delivery of the thank-you letter can make a super impression.    What if I do receive an offer faster than I can send a thank you?  Send it anyway to thank the employer for the interview and the offer. Your letter can  also accept or decline the offer. An acceptance letter can re-state your understanding  or the terms of the offer (salary, benefits, vacations days, starting date, paid  training, etc.); that way any discrepancies can be red-flagged by the employer and  straightened out before you start.    Is there anything you can do to make an even better impression with your thank you?  Find a way to personalize it. If you notice that the interviewer collects elephant  figurines, for example, write your thank-you note on a notecard with an elephant  picture on it. Or send a clipping of an article you think the interviewer would be interested in.       Have questions about other aspects of job-hunting?

Synergy                        is about developing an environment in which each employee                        has an opportunity actualize personal potential while nurturing                        team members.

Top                        Ten Organizational Diversity and Inclusion Beliefs                       Organizations                        committed to diversity and inclusion work toward the goal                        with a core set of beliefs. These beliefs serve as a foundation                        for achieving their goal. The top ten beliefs are:                                                                                                                                              Racism                              and other forms of oppression affect all people and                              systems.                             Racism                              has effects that hurt all individuals: Whites, Blacks,                              Asians, Hispanics, Native Americans, Gay-Lesbians,                              Physically-Different, etc.                             Racism                              decreases productivity.                             It                              is possible to develop diversity and thus change the                              current cultural norms.                             Identifying                              the steps involved in developing diverse systems gives                              people a map to follow.                             Organizations                              move through cycles, not linear processes.                             Developing                              diversity entails an organizational and cultural effort                              to change.                             Developing                              diversity causes people and systems to be upset.                             When                              organizations reach a point of change, its members                              may get stuck, feel frightened, or feel they have                              completed necessary changes. These reactions limit                              their ability to move forward.                             To                              achieve the maximum benefits of change, the process                              must be managed and designed strategically.                                                                                                                                                                Top Ten Preconditions for Making a Shift Toward Diversity                        and Inclusion                       How                        do organizations that are serious about diversity and inclusion                        achieve their goal? The following is a list of preconditions                        that help position organizations to evolve toward diversity                        and inclusion.                                                                                                                                              The                              leadership must understand that a diverse workforce                              will enrich problem-solving and embody different approaches                              to work. The endresult is a more productive and creative                              institution.                             The                              leadership must recognize both the learning opportunities                              and the challenges that different perspectives offer                              the organization.                             The                              organizational culture must promote an expectation                              of high standards and excellence.                             The                              organization must achieve a critical mass of employees                              with different perspectives.                             The                              organizational culture must stimulate personal development.                             The                              organization must encourage openness and trust.                             The                              culture must make workers feel valued.                             The                              organization must have a well-articulated, widely                              understood, and inclusive mission.                             The                              organization must have a relatively egalitarian, nonbureaucratic                              structure.                             The                              organization must model and reward the inclusive behaviors.                                                                                                                                                                 Top Ten Questions for A Staff Diversity & Inclusion                        Focus Group                       A                        Focus Group is the collection of information in a group                        setting. For example, a group of employees and a facilitator                        discuss the cultural climate of their organization. Focus                        Groups have distinct advantages over other Diversity Audit                        tools. One advantage is that it permits clarification and                        explanation of the information being discussed. It is also                        more personal than surveys. Asking the right questions to                        receive information about diversity and inclusion is important.                        Below are ten crucial questions:                                                                                                                                              What                              are the signs that your organization values diversity?                             What                              do you wish that management understood about your                              own group?                             What                              are the obstacles in the way of employees who are                              different from the mainstream?                             What                              kinds of prejudice or discrimination have you faced,                              if any?                             What                              contributions and behaviors are most valued and rewarded                              here?                             What                              behaviors of other groups are more difficult for you                              to deal with or most irritating.                             What                              do you wish that your manager understood about you?                             What                              do you need to do and/or know to get ahead in this                              organization?                             What                              groups are easiest for you to cooperate with? What                              groups are the hardest?                             What                              do you think the organization could do to get the                              best from everyone?                                                                                                                                        Top                        10 Reasons Diversity OD Efforts Fails                       Starting                        a Diversity Organizational Development effort is difficult.                        One way to increase the probability of success is to learn                        from the mistakes of others. Below is a list of sources                        of failure.                                                                                                                                              Failure                              to establish specific goals for the Diversity OD efforts                              and interventions                             Failure                              to demonstrate sufficient courage to deal the resistance                              in the organization and among key managers                             Failure                              to specify both short- and long-term goals for the                              effort                             Failure                              to keep the real client in mind                             Failure                              to work with real organizational diversity needs                             Failure                              to be honest about what needs to be done and why                             Failure                              to develop viable options when ideas do not work                             Failure                              to solve problems by producing ""quick fixes.""                             Failure                              to work with the organization as it is rather than                              as you would like it to be                             Failure                              to measure or evaluate the activities                                                                                                                                                                Other                          reasons include:                          11. Failure to plan for and build toward the client managers'                          ownership of the OD effort                          12. Failure to escape entrapment in the ""mystique""                          of OD, which leads to a distorted interpretation of the                          OD process                          13. Failure to tailor the effort to the jointly analyzed                          needs of the specific organization                                             Can                        you think of anything else to add to this list? If so, please                        send your ideas to us so we can share them.                       Don't                        let all these negatives make you feel like the job is too                        big. Simply being aware that certain negative behavior patterns                        have the potential to negatively influence on success can                        help avoid such                        behaviors.                       The                        Diversity Training Challenge                       One                        of the most challenging series of programs was an oil company                        that wanted a program for a functionally diverse group,                        including managers, engineers, drivers, and other support                        personnel who had contact with service station owners.                                                The service station owners were more diverse as a group                        that consisted of recently arrived immigrants--Turkey, Korea,                        Armenia, and Cuba, for example. Each training required different                        content, depending on the particular cultural group our                        trainees were encountering. But, that wasn't the most challenging.                        We discovered that an overlay of corporate culture issues                        would surface as these different functional groups came                        together for the first time. It required a change of approach                        on our part. We learned to step back and let these corporate                        issues get worked through by participants, before we went                        on with the content. A lot of the participants' communication                        was aimed at the key people in the room.                       After                        the first couple of trainings in this project, we decided                        to work with the client to actively engage these issues.                        We did an up-front survey of participants, to minimize surprises.                       These                        initial interviews were often educational for the client.                        Then we brought Human Resource and other managers into the                        training sessions so we could get a discussion going. After                        the corporate culture issues were considered, we could proceed                        to general intercultural strategies and specific cultural                        formation.                       The                        key was to strike balance between general intercultural                        information and tangible specific strategies for handling                        conflict--How do you tell when conflict is brewing under                        the surface? What do you look for so you can diffuse a situation?                        And finally as part of the wrap up, we had participants                        look at how they were going to apply what they'd learned--What                        are you going to do with this? How is it going to help you                        tomorrow?                       Bausch                        & Lomb's Strategic Diversity & Staffing Office found                        the above information company along with the DTUI e-Newsletter                        so helpful in the implementation of their strategic initiative                        that they wrote the following:                       DTUI                        information has been extremely useful in improving Bausch                        & Lomb's diversity initiative and results. The creative                        and insightful concepts outlined by DTUI makes the very                        critical link between diversity interventions and business                        results. Access to DTUI's information is critical to achieving                        our results--Clayton H. Osborne, Director, Strategic Staffing                        & Diversity.                       As                        if these powerful were not enough, Bausch & Lomb contributed                        $300 to DTUI's work. This money will help a needy student                        who aspires to become a diversity trainer.                       By                        coupling what this information contains with your own resources,                        you can make similar things happen in your workplace or                        organization.                       You                        can also benefit from our expertise. Taking a DTUI course                        will give you considerable expertise to meet the demands                        of the complexities of developing and implementing a strategic                        diversity initiative.

Job  seekers, too, can use the same strategy to their            advantage. In the annals of the employment world, many [ job search ]            success stories can be attributed to a very simple tool: a thank you            letter. Yes, a thank you letter sent right after an interview can            create a positive impression on interviewers, often resulting in the            much wanted job offer. A thank you letter reassures the hiring manager            about your continued interest, provides you yet another opportunity to            ask for the job (or the next                         interview ), and also allows you to            restate your strengths persuasively.                        Despite the inherent simplicity and potential benefits, it is very            surprising that many                         job  seekers still don resort to such a simple            method for getting an edge over the competition. Those that do send                         thank you letters  often use generic documents that do little to market            them.                        While writing a                         thank you letter , keep the following tips in mind:                                                                                   Click Here to Subscribe To Our FREE Newsletter                                                               Proofread carefully            Just like your                                                              resume            and                          cover letter , the                         thank you letter  also needs to be proofread very carefully. While a                                                              resume            and                          cover letter  may give the first impression, a thank you letter            might be your last -- not in any way less important than the first.            Don let this opportunity slip because of some minr (oh, you noticed            it should have been minor) typo. Get the point? Anyone can make            mistakes.                                                 Re-state your selling points            While writing the                         thank you letter ,            re-summarize your strongest selling points for the interviewer. This            will refresh their memory and also give you a competitive advantage            over candidates who did not send a                         thank you note                                                 Personalize the thank you note            Well, this is absolutely important.            You must make references to the interview conversation. This            demonstrates how attentive you were and also helps the interviewer            re-connect with you.                                                 Re-express your enthusiasm and interest for the job/company            Make an            effort to write about how enthusiastic you are about the company and            the position (without sounding desperate).                                                 Don forget to thank every interviewer            Yes, you must send a                         thank you letter  to every person you met during the interview process. And,            please it is very important to send personalized thank you notes.            Imagine, if the interviewers reconvened only to find that you sent the            same thank you letter to all of them.                                                 Politely ask for the job or follow-up step (e.g. next interview)            Don forget to ask for the                         job  (or the next                         interview ).                                                 Send right after interview            Send the                         thank you letter  on the same day,            preferably by snail mail.

Your recruiter should be able to provide you with some information.          For additional information, search the web or go to the library. In today's          world of mass communication, there is no excuse for lack of research.         Questions you should          ask at the interview:                   Why is this position            available?           What are your goals            for this position?           What type of training            programs will be offered to the person in this position?            What obstacles            must be overcome for the person in this position to succeed?            How will my performance            be evaluated?            What opportunities            are there for growth?            What growth do            you anticipate for the company over the next 12 months?                 Think about how          you would answer the following questions:                   Tell me about yourself.            Keep your answer to the professional realm only. Review your past positions,            education and other strengths.           What do you know            about our organization? If you've done your research, you should have            no problem with this one. Be positive.            Why are you interested            in this position? Relate how you feel your qualifications match the            job requirements and express your desire to work for the company.            What are the most            significant accomplishments in your career thus far? Pick recent accomplishments            that relate to this position and its requirements.           Describe a situation            in which your work was criticized. Focus on how you solved the situation            and how you became a better person because of it.           How would you describe            your personality?            How do you perform            under pressure?            What have you done            to improve yourself over the past year?            What did you like            least about your last position?            Why are you considering            leaving your current position?            What is your ideal            working environment?            How would your            coworkers describe you?            What do you think            of your boss?            Have you ever fired            anyone? What was the situation and how did you handle it?            Are you creative?            What are your career            goals?            Where do you see            yourself in two years?            Why should we hire            you?            What salary are            you looking for?            What other types            of jobs/companies are you considering?                                                                                                                   Do's                   Arrive 15 minutes            early. Late attendance is unacceptable.           Pay attention.           Clarify questions.            Be sure to answer the questions the interviewer really asks. If you            don't understand the question, ask the interviewer to rephrase it.           Speak Clearly.           Use proper grammar,            syntax, and a good vocabulary.           Logically organize            your thoughts and answers.           Make use of non-verbal            communication and body language.           Exhibit self-confidence.           Appear energetic            and enthusiastic.           Have the interviewer            describe the position and responsibilities to you early in the conversation            so you can relate your skills and background to the position throughout            the interview.            Sell your qualifications.            Stress the accomplishments that are most relevant to the job.            Conduct yourself            professionally. Be aware of what your body language is saying. Smile,            make eye contact. Don't slouch. Maintain composure.           Anticipate tough            questions. Prepare in advance so you can turn apparent weaknesses into            strengths.            Dress appropriately.            Make a professional first impression.            Ask questions throughout            the interview. An interview is not a one-sided conversation. You are            interviewing the employer as much as they are interviewing you.            Listen. This is            one of the most important abilities. By concentrating not only on the            employer's words, but also on the tone of voice and body language, you            will pick up on the employer's style. You will understand how the employer            thinks and can pattern your answers accordingly. This way you will be            able to better relate to him or her.                 Don'ts                   Don't answer vague            questions. Get the employer to be more specific and then respond.            Never interrupt            the employer. If you don't have time to listen, neither does the employer.            Don't smoke, chew            gum or place anything on the employer's desk.            Don't be overly            familiar, even if the employer is doing all of these things.            Don't wear heavy            perfume or cologne.            Don't ramble. Long            answers often make the speaker sound apologetic or indecisive.            On the other hand,            don't answer questions with a simple ""yes"" or ""no"". Explain whenever            possible.            Do not lie. Answer            questions as truthfully as possible.            Do not make derogatory            remarks about your present or former employers or companies.           Don't bring up compensation.            Always let the employer bring up money first.                 Closing the Interview                    Many people second-guess            themselves after an interview. By closing strongly and asking the right            questions, you can eliminate the post-interview doubts that tend to            plague most interviewees.            If you think that            the interview went well and you would like to take the next step, be            sure and express your interest to the hiring authority. Try something            like this:                         ""After hearing              more about your company and the position, I am certain that I have              the qualities that you are looking for in the (title) position. Based              on our conversation and my qualifications, are there any concerns              that you have that would lead you to believe otherwise?""                      You have the right            to be assertive. You should ask a closing question such as the above            because it opens the door for the employer to be honest with you about            his or her feelings. If there are concerns, this is a time to overcome            them. You have one final chance to dispel the concerns, sell your strengths            and end the interview on a positive note.                 Some things to          remember during the closing process:                   Do not be discouraged            if there is not an offer made or specific salary discussed. The interviewer            will probably want to talk with the office first or meet with other            applicants before making a decision.            Be sure that you            can answer the following questions: ""Why are you interested in the company?,""            and ""What can you offer?.""            Thank the employer            for his/her time and consideration and shake his/her hand with a firm            handshake.            Ask the employer            for a business card so you can write a thank you note as soon as possible.            Send a handwritten            thank you note to the employer within 24 hours after the interview.                 Following Up                    When you get back            in your car, promptly write down key issues uncovered in the interview.            Think of the qualifications that the employer is looking for and match            your strengths to them. Immediately call your recruiter! Follow-up is            critical!                                                       Writing Thank You Letters                                           Tips for sending your follow-up letter:         Send out your thank-you letters no later than 24        hours after your interview has ended.         Always keep your audience in mind. Address the        issues and the concerns that were mentioned during the interview.         Use the thank-you letter as a follow-up ""sales""        letter, in which you restate your reasons for wanting the position and        remind the interviewer why you're qualified.         Mention anything of importance that your        interviewer might've neglected to ask in person.         If you're only writing a few sentences, send a        handwritten note. Otherwise, send a typed, formatted letter (see sample        letters below).         Thank everyone who contributed to your job search.         If you decide after the interview that you don't        want the job after all, write a respectful note withdrawing your        application.         Choose your words carefully when using email. Email        creates an instant written record, so don't let the speed and the ease of        sending it blind you to the fact that you will be judged on what you've        said and how you've said it.

Sincerely,       Alex Applicant       Borrowed from Brilliant People.com site                                                                                                            What is a behavioral            based interview? A behavioral based interview is basically an interview            designed to gather information that will tell the employer how you will            perform on the job. The principle behind this technique is the belief            that the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior. This interview            technique involves asking questions designed to get you to talk about            how you handled certain situations in the past.                        For example, if a company has a high-stress environment, the interviewer            might ask you to talk about whether you have ever been in a stressful            situation in the past. If you say yes, the interview will proceed with            questions about what you did in the situation, how it made you feel,            how others responded to your actions, how you relieved the stress in            the situation and so forth.                        In most situations the interviewer will have determined several behavioral            characteristics that would be important for on-the-job success and will            have a definition of each such characteristic.                        For example:                        Project Management-Taking responsibility for organizing projects, monitoring            progress, resolving problems, and reporting on status.                        Good Listening- The ability to listen to a client's problems, be empathetic,            asking appropriate questions and paraphrasing the responses.                        Typically in a behavioral interview you will be provided with the definitions            of desired characteristics and asked for examples of situations in which            you have exhibited those characteristics. After you have given an example            you may be asked for another, in order for the interviewer to test the            depth of your experience.                        Nonverbal clues also speak loudly. Behavioral interviews are not just            about what you say. During the interview, the employer will also observe            your behavior and communication skills. The interviewer will note how            you maintain eye contact, speak, listen, make use of non-verbal communication            and body language, exhibit self-confidence and appear energetic and            enthusiastic.           Employers often            choose to use behavioral type of interviews because job candidates can't            prepare for these questions beforehand. However, you can help yourself            by anticipating the types of questions you might be asked and thinking            up examples of past behavior. You may be able to think up some possible            questions the interviewer might ask by analyzing the job requirements            ahead of time.                        Behavioral interviews can be difficult, but preparation will help. By            preparing for your interview ahead of time you may be seen as better            suited than the other candidates who don't anticipate these types of            questions.

The                          Diversity Training Profession is a Multi-Billion Dollar                          Industry                          Three recent movements have resulted in the                          diversity training profession becoming a lucrative industry.                         One is a couple of United States Supreme Court rulings                         in the late 1990s that supported the use of diversity                         training to protect organizations from discrimination                         lawsuits. After that point, more organizations started                         diversity initiatives and diversity training programs                         in an effort to increase legal protection.   [Read                         the History of Diversity Training in  Strategic                         Diversity & Inclusion Managment Magazine  (Spring, 2007) for details.]                                                                                       Globalization                         is another movement that has increased the popularity                         of diversity programs. Global economic ties encourage                         multinational and international cooperation that require                         cultural competence in order to gain a competitive                         edge. Most international mergers, for example, fail as                         a result of an inability to overcome cultural differences.                         This is one reason that more than 50 Fortune 500 businesses                         wrote briefs to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 to argue                         their support for affirmative action college admissions                         policies. The briefs consistently noted the importance                         of higher education diversity programs in contributing                       to long term economic security.                                                                                          The                          third movement is the trend towards a shift away from                          production industry to knowledge and service industry.                          What an individual knows and how well she shares her knowledge                          are critical competencies in the modern organization.                          Sharing knowledge in a diverse and global organization                          requires competencies beyond technical expertise.                                                                                                               One                           reason diversity and knowledge sharing have received                           increase attention is the success of the Silicon Valley.                           The high tech park outside of Boston was predicted                           to be the most successful of such enterprises that                           emerged during the 1990s. Experts agree that Silicon                           Valley emerged as the most successful model due to                           the considerable diversity among those working together                           in the high tech area. Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC San                           Diego, and a number of other California universities                           attracted undergraduates and graduate students from                           across the globe, most notably China, Singapore, Europe,                           India, and Taiwan. Many of the foreign students were                           studying engineering and the Silicon Valley was the                           place to get experience. Of course, they found their                           way to Silicon Valley as interns, employees, and even                           company owners.                                                                                                               Beyond                            the people diversity, early Silicon Valley offered                           a culturally-rich  environment in its early stages                           of growth. One reason is that the location at the time                           was cheap compared to real estate in San Francisco                           Bay Area. Bohemians, who were artisans and musicians,                           lived in this cost-effective area that the thriving                           IT park soon engulfed. The young engineers would work                           together all day and spend their free time in coffee                           shops, pubs, and other public areas conversing about                           their enterprise. We learned that their creative juices                           flowed in a stimulating, open-minded way as they consumed                           music, sidewalk art, spirital, and other Bohemian offerings.                           Today, the area real estate is too expensive for Bohemians                           and  the tech bust has changed the atmosphere. However,                           today about one third of Silicon Valley companies is                           owned by foreign-born high tech entrepreneurs, and                           the majority of them were educated in the United States.                           One reason they are successful is that they travel                           between their birthplace and the United States conducting                           high tech business. What we learned is the close link                           between diversity and innovation.                                                                                       Diversity                         and inclusion is now a global movement. The European                         Union architects understood that one of the strengths                         of forming a union was the increased availability of                         expert knowledge brought about, in part, by the diversity                         across sister countries. That is why managing diversity                         is of highest priority in the strategic plan to create                         a sustainable union. Another example comes from Singapore,                         which has created strategic business “islands” that                         locate multinational  companies in the same enterprise                         next to each other in order  to encourage knowledge sharing.                                                                                          Many                          organizations use diversity initiatives to create similar                          environments, however they admit needing support in creating                          the full circumstances for doing so.   Learn                          about how to make a case for a diversity initiative by                          following the link below corresponding to Starting Your                          Own Diversity Initiative.                                                                                                              Higher                          Education, Healthcare Profession and Fortune 500 Companies                          Have Led the Way                          Higher education has been a leader in the implementation                         and development of multicultural education curricular.                         The  Westinghouse Workplace 2000 study report made it clear                         that  higher education must prepare graduates for working                         in a  demographically different world. Multicultural education                         was also viewed as a way to attract and retain students                         of color. Long discussions and cultural wars have been                         fought  over changing the canon or core general education                         courses. The result is that                         the vast majority of universities and colleges have introduced                         ethnic studies and multicultural education as part of its                         required general education requirements.                                                                                                              In                         many ways the healthcare system has been the model in                         focusing on cultural competencies. One possible reason                         is that the disparities in healthcare deliver have a                         dire consequence because poor care decisions can result                         in creating more problems for clients--the costly of                         which is death. One certainly wants to avoid making a                       poor decision due to linguistic and other cultural differences.                         Healthcare facility accreditation also rests on showing                         programmatic efforts to promote cultural competence.                                                                                         Cultural                          competence in healthcare enables effective work in cross-cultural                          situations. According to Laurie Anderson, PhD, MPH and                          colleagues, a culturally competent healthcare setting                          offers an appropriate mix of the following:                                                                                                                                         A                            culturally diverse staff that reflects the communities                            served,                                                                                                                         Providers                            or translators who speak the clients' language(s),                                                                                                                         Training                            for providers about the culture and language of the                            people they serve,                                                                                                                         Signage                            and instructional literature in the clients' language(s)                            and consistent with their cultural norms,                                                                                                                          Culturally                            specific healthcare settings.                                                                                                                         These                            features will reduce inequities in healthcare delivery,                            reduce health risks, and protect the profession legally.                                                                                                              The                        Demand for Expertise is Greater than the Available Talent                        Since 1999, Fortune 500 companies have actively engaged                        in the design, development, and implementation of diversity                        initiatives. A diversity initiative goes beyond the Supreme                        Court rulings in that the organization is seeking to promote                        an image of being inclusive. This is due to demographic                        shifts in the United States. No longer can an organization                        assume that recruitment is simply a matter of selecting                        the best candidate among the applicants.                                                                                          The                          applicant pool today tends to be better educated and diverse,                          especially in service jobs. An increased number of women                          and people of color among applicants create a challenge                          for many organizations because old criteria for determining                          who is the most qualified do not work. Organizations will                          hire the best talent that will contribute to a competitive                          recruitment and retention edge. A diversity initiative                          is ideally a strategy for gaining a competitive edge.                          In its simplest form, a diversity initiative involves                          the development of a mission statement, forming a diversity                          steering committee, and disseminating information about                          the organization’s commitment to diversity (Refer                          to Starting A Diversity Initiative below for more details).                                                                                                               One                            reason that more cultural competency experts are needed                            is that today each Fortune 1000 company has some form                            of long term diversity program and that smaller companies                           are quickly following suit. Professionals with specialized                           knowledge  about how to capitalize on diversity are                           needed to take  existing programs to the next level                           and assist those companies  that are just now getting                           on board. Thus, we see the rise of the Chief Diversity                           Officer .                                                                                                               It                          is interesting that with the increase in appreciation                          for diversity and efforts to harness it in the service                          of productivity, the number of existing experts and training                          programs are not growing quickly enough. One reason is                          that many westerners believe that diversity expertise                          is a matter of being liberal-minded, rather than a competency                          for which training is needed. However, the diversity professionals                          who are experts have developed their competency by receiving                          degrees in social science, years of trial and error experience,                          and a considerable amount of personal work in train-the-trainer                          seminars and workshops.                                                                                                              Those                          who are among the best know that training skills are merely                          one component of diversity expertise needed today. Others                          have not been properly trained, but have earned their                          position as an in-house diversity professional or consultant                          on the basis of being a pioneer or advocate. The pioneer                          is a person who has been in the forefront of promoting                          diversity within an organization for a long time. An advocate                          is someone who is outspoken in efforts to promote inclusion                          within an organization. It is their conviction that gets                          them the position, rather than specialized knowledge--Notwithstanding                          the fact that some of these pioneers and advocates have                          acquired considerable expertise. The point is that many                          pioneers have not received training within a full program                          that is designed and developed with their specific professional                          needs in mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                               Anna Lind, an EU Architect                                                                                                                                                                                   Consider                            the fact that in Sweden the more successful diversity                            experts were trained as economists and engineers.                           This  does not mean they are not good at the work that                           they  do. However, Sweden does not offer formal diversity                           trainer  or cultural competency development programs.                           One reason  economists and engineers are attractive                           as diversity experts is because corporate leaders                            wants to know how investing                           in a diversity initiative will pay off. These professionals                           offer data-driven initiatives, which make them more “credible”                          in the eyes of corporate skeptics. Most of these professionals                          have studied in the United States or England.                                                                                       The                        point is that most experts have had to bootstrap cultural                        competencies from reading, life experience, and tidbits                        of information from here and there. DTUI is designed to                        take the trial and error out of becoming an expert.                                                                                          You                          Can Take Advantage of This Professional Opportunity                          Few resources exist that offer state-of-the-art programs                          to develop your expertise as a diversity officer or                         consultant.                                                                                                                Diversity                            training skills are not enough. A lot of good trainers                            exist in the diversity profession. However, the trend                            is towards in-house training that utilizes employee                           instructors,  rather than outsourcing. Independent                           consultants and trainers  are still needed for small                           jobs and to do large scale  training in response to                           legal requirements (such as fulfilling  the requirements                           of a lawsuit settlement), but forward  thinking organizations                           have a long term strategic diversity  initiative. One                           way to offset the costs of extensive training  is to                           train people in-house as trainers. We can argue  the                           pros and cons of such strategies, but that would be                            beside the point because organizations will likely                           choose  the most cost-effective solutions. Training                           in-house training  is considered a diversity best practice                           at this time. But keep in mind that there is too much                           work for one staff member, so they will continue to                           seek the support of consultants and trainers.                                                                                       The                        program that will benefit you most will offer you the following                        expertise:                                                                                                                                               Organizational development and effectiveness skills                                                                                                                                                     Knowledge management                                                                                                                         Training                            and facilitation skills                                                                                                                                                     An understanding of organizational culture                                                                     Human                        capital diversity assessment                       Linking                        diversity, human capital, and organizational goals                                                                                                       High impact diversity recruitment and retention strategies                                                                     Cultural                        competency and customer satisfaction secrets                                                                                                       Managing diversity proficiency                                                                                                                                         We                          train people to commit to cultural competency and model                          it for others. The profession will grow into a viable                          enterprise to the extent that the proper credentialing                          and commitment are recognized by the larger professional                          community.                                                     Training Model                          The program is in two levels. The first requires attending                         a 4-day seminar and the second involves a 3-day seminar.                                                                                       The                         format is short lectures, individual and small group                         exercises, and discussion. There is plenty of opportunity                         for practical challenges individual face in their work                         due to the small size, which is no more than 20 people.                                                                                          We                            assume that trainers need cultural competence to provide                           high  impact diversity training and consultation. DTUI                           trains  the four components of cultural competency:                           (a) awareness,  (b) attitudes, (c) knowledge, and (d)                           skills. Awareness  refers to the insights an individual                           has into their emotional,  psychological, and behavior                           responses to diversity. Research  indicates that many                           of us, for example, have blind spots  concerning our                           openness to diversity. Attitude refers  to our personal                           biases, moral positions, and openness  to differences.                           Knowledge refers to the concepts, skill  requirements,                           and ethics associated with diversity training.  Skills                           refer to the ability to effectively serve as a  cultural                           competency professional.                                                                                      Practicing                         in the act of learning is central to the DTUI training                         philosophy. However, novice trainers have an ethical                         responsibility to conduct diversity work under the supervision                         of an expert. DTUI assumes that diversity training and                         consulting competency requires rigorous training in an                       adult learning format.

Leading Diversity: A Comparative Analysis    by Kenneth Rice     Creating successful, diverse and dynamic learning organizations involves developing processes to ensure that the differences of employees, customers, and community are taken into account. Diversity management is an active process that requires an investment in time and resources. It is a paradigm shift from intentional exclusion to an intentional full utilization of resources. Valuing and managing diversity requires policies, relationships, procedures, and practices that will ensure fairness and equity. It means more than increasing awareness, but also changing the system to support differences for the benefit of all.

Increasing sales volumes? Controlling unit inventory? Building a strong customer relationship base? Chances are you'd shake your head ""No"" to each one. While these three challenges might consume a good portion of your time and fall near the top of your list of concerns, it may be that dealing with the wants, needs and varied personalities of your staff is really what taxes you most. Whether your dealership is large or small, you'll almost invariably find yourself interacting with subordinates who differ from you in their abilities, reactions, attitudes, ambitions and expectations, or in their work approach, viewpoint, communication style, pace and level of confidence. Yet, somehow, you need to pull everyone together, expand the horizons of your business, boost morale and keep even the less-than-perfect employee fit enough to perform effectively. Gaining a firm grasp of your own unique work style along with the style of each team member can help you achieve multiple objectives — like increasing sales volumes, controlling unit inventory and building a strong customer relationship base. It is the key to your dealership's long-term growth and success. It's important to have specific, accurate insight into why you manage the way you do. Managers need to understand the how's and why's of their own motivational trigger buttons before they can tap into someone else's. Assuming everyone wants to be managed the way you think is a big mistake; plan to be flexible as a leader and modify your typical business techniques to suit each employee in order to gain respect, attention, enthusiasm and cooperation. There is no such thing as successful, one-size-fits-all management. And it's not until you assess your own typical on-the-job behavior that you'll be able to understand what each subordinate needs from you in order to accomplish goals. Mismanagement leads to low morale, frequent turnover, severed relationships, lost time, minimal productivity and high expenses. It can also be the real reason behind an employee's poor performance and sour disposition. Avoid falling prey by learning what you can do right now to grow your team to their full potential. Know the predictable behavior of your subordinates, and be certain that the responsibilities you assign, the expectations you hold and the goals you set are realistic and attainable for each uniquely wired member of your staff. While in theory there may be an almost endless array of personality trait combinations, here are a few of the more commonly seen ones, as well as some tips on how to motivate and manage them: Technically minded, methodical, passive workers These individuals respond best to clear, concise communication and often choose to ask questions or receive task-related information via e-mail versus interfacing. They're private people who favor predictability. Give them as much warning as possible of changes or due dates. Avoid rushing them. Stay available to provide direction; work them into a routine; and appreciate their inclination to think logically, cautiously and realistically. Fast-paced, highly sociable, easy-going workers Variety in their day; an upbeat, animated boss and readily-attainable objectives should keep these personalities satisfied and loyal. When a task calls for someone who likes talking to people and keeping busy, they will take it on readily. Keep them in low-pressure situations. Give tedious, number-based tasks to someone else. Use their diplomacy skills to your advantage in jobs like hospitality, reception, public relations, human relations or creative advertising. Competitive, authoritative, self-directing workers People who display a large measure of self-confidence and drive might seem hard to control in secondary roles, but they often find their niche in sales or management. Typically creative and bold, they value incentives, want to give their opinions, and enjoy challenges. Try not to dictate to them after-the-fact. One secret to harnessing the power of these leadership personalities lies in partnering with them, eliciting their views and making them feel they have an important say in many work-related matters. Managing becomes much easier once you know which motivational strategies work best for which employees. You also must be willing to vary your approach — at least to some degree. Some people respond best to clearly defined objectives, specific instructions and frequent feedback about their job performance. Expecting them to work with minimal oversight and jump into situations is unrealistic, and bound to lead to mutual frustration and resentment. Conversely, there are likely others on your team who expect from you quite the opposite. These less-structured workers want general overviews and freedom to make independent decisions, approaching a task from their own perspective. Requiring adherence to strict procedures or micromanaging them dilutes their creativity and almost always breeds underlying performance-hindering malcontent. Keying into the management style that is most effective with each individual has another advantage: it enables you to communicate in a way that your subordinate will understand. It's a time saver. For example, once you know that your newest hire is more reserved, fact-oriented and analytical, you can feel free to get right to the point when speaking and do so in a businesslike, straightforward fashion. Save your anecdotes and more casual conversations for someone else. When challenges and disagreements are prevalent at a dealership, employees and employers often blame one another. A manager might wonder when his subordinate will start to live up to expectations, while that same subordinate may simply label the boss ""a loser"" and start looking for another job. Without question, there are times when two people clash and there is nothing that can rectify the situation. Indeed, there may be such a bad fit with so little job or environmental compatibility that termination becomes the only option. However, in other cases, it may be that the reason we can't stand working with someone is really because we haven't taken the time to understand the person. The truth is that there are actions you, as a manager, can take — techniques you are free to adopt and apply that will make your job far less stressful. Knowing more about the predictable behaviors of your team makes it easier to devise succession plans; strategize; hire; promote; coach; and pinpoint where, when and how your employee investments can make the greatest difference. Developing your dealership's staff should be the top priority, but it's one that can be either bothersome or rewarding, depending on how willing you are to learn why your workers do the things they do.

Abstract   Today, workforce diversity is no longer just about anti-discrimination legal compliance. The spotlight of concept of workforce diversity is the impact of inclusion and corporate performance. Corporations see diversity as a competitive advantage that brings economic benefits when diversity is realigned to the strategic business goals of the corporations.   This paper intends to discuss the concept of workforce diversity and approaches relevant in managing diversity. It also discusses the relevance of Human Resource Management (HRM) discipline in dealing with diversity management and the integration issues of diversity management in term of International Human Resource Management (IHRM) and Strategic International Human Resource Management (SIHRM).

Introduction   Over the last few years, it is getting clearer that organizations commence to pursue workforce diversity as a competitive necessity. It is not only to avoid the heavy costs of litigation (often time involve equal employment opportunity (EEO) legislation), but to value and pursue workforce diversity well so that organizations could attract, retain and encourage the contribution from a diverse population of employees to serve diverse range of customers, work effectively with business partners and suppliers, and satisfy shareholders. This is in light with growing multiculturalism of workforce and market places.   The new concept of diversity goes well beyond the traditional EEO. It calls for recognition of contributions of the individuals with diverse background. It calls for management of organizations to embrace difference and inclusiveness, not just tolerating those who are different but celebrating those differences. It calls for opening of work opportunities to the men and women of different colors, races and religions. It calls for diversity beyond gender, values, or social norms that each individual lives.   Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine the concept of diversity and review the approaches to deal with diversity management, from the academic literature viewpoints. It also discusses the role of HRM, IHRM and SIHRM in implementing and integrating the diversity initiatives.   The next section of this paper attempts to define diversity. Section 3 discusses the approaches of managing diversity, establishing the reason behind the importance of putting diversity into workplace. In order to be successfully implemented, diversity must be realigned to the strategic business goals of the organizations. Section 5 examines the relationship between diversity and the Human Resource Management (HRM) discipline and tries to explore its connectedness to corporate performance. Section 6 confers the ideas of global diversity and this paper concludes after looking into the challenges of diversity initiatives implementation.    2. Understanding Diversity   2.1. Diversity Defined   There is no one definitive definition of diversity (Tomervik 1995). Diversity is a complex, multidimensional concept as a whole. It is a plural term with different perceptions in different organizations, societies and national cultures without any unitary meaning (Cassell 2001). Cox (2001) attempts to define diversity as the variation of social and cultural identities among people existing together in a defined employment or market setting.   Thomas (1995) acknowledges that diversity does not automatically mean with respect to race and gender and describes diversity as not synonymous with differences but encompasses differences and similarities. Wentling & Palma-Rivas (1997) propose the narrow and broad definitions of diversity (Mor Barak 2005). Narrow definitions tend to reflect Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) law, and define diversity in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, age, national origin, religion, and disability. Broad definition may include values, personality characteristics, education, language, physical appearance, marital status, lifestyle, beliefs, and background characteristics such as geographical origin, tenure within the organization, and economic status. Even health, body size, family background and shape are also categories for grouping people (Humphries and Grice 1995). Diversity is simply all the ways in which we differ (Hayles 1992).   Morrison (1992) categorize diversity in four levels (1) diversity as racial/ethnic/sexual balance; (2) diversity as understanding other cultures; (3) diversity as culturally divergent values and (4) diversity as broadly inclusive (cultural, subcultural, and individual). Griggs (1995) offers another classification of diversity. The author classifies diversity into primary and secondary dimensions. Primary dimensions of diversity (which are hard to change) are those human differences that are inborn and/or that exert an important impact on our socialization and have an ongoing impact throughout our lives. The six primary dimensions include age, ethnicity gender, physical abilities/qualities or race. Primary diversity shapes our basic self-image and has great influence on how we view the world. The secondary dimensions of diversity are those that can be changed and include, but are not limited to, educational background, geographic location, income, marital status, military experience, religious beliefs, and work experience. Norton and Fox (1997) argue that employee diversity and organizational change are inextricably linked, and that these two elements have rarely been integrated sufficiently to meet the demands of todays fast-paced economy.    2.2. Diversity Management Paradigms   Researches specify that the management diversity initiatives has moved beyond legal compliance with equality legislations to accepting and valuing differences (Cassell, 2001), learning from diversity (Thomas and Ely 1996), and towards the full and equal utilization of capabilities through empowerment and inclusion (Cornelius and Bassett-Jones 2002). Thomas and Ely (1996) offer four paradigms, describing the efforts of management intervention in workforce diversity.   Resistance Paradigm   Organizations react to resist change due to diversity by maintaining the status quo in the absence of any pressures to increase diversity (Dass and Parker 1999) and by reproducing inequality without an equal opportunities or diversity policy (Kirton and Greene 2005).   Discrimination-and-fairness Paradigm   Organizations focus on equal opportunities and fair treatment through legislative actions and by treating everybody the same (Thomas and Ely 1996). This is demonstrated by concentrating on staff recruitment as a means to increase the numbers of employees belonging to disadvantaged groups (Kandola and Fullerton 1998).   Access-and-legitimacy Paradigm   Organizations focus on a search for business benefits (Thomas and Ely 1996), maximizing every individuals potential as a source of competitiveness by creating a culture and environment of respect (Kandola and Fullerton 1998).   Learning-and-effectiveness Paradigm   Organizations emphasize the linkages of diversity with work and employee perspectives, moving from identity-groups towards learning opportunities in order to gain the benefits of diversity (Thomas and Ely 1996, Dass and Parker 1999). In this paradigm, egalitarian organizational culture is seen as a means to higher standards of performance (Thomas and Ely 1996) and in which employees are viewed as valuable resources, strategic assets and as an investment (Ely and Thomas 2001).   While moving beyond the discrimination-and-fairness paradigm, this paper continues to focus on both the access-and-legitimacy and learning-and-effectiveness paradigms as the key motivations for organizations to realize diversity management programs. The following section of this paper explores the business case for diversity intervention in organizations. As the implementation of diversity initiatives is not costless, thus, it is imperative for organization to develop a sound business case for adopting the concept of diversity as part of the overall corporate strategy.    3. Managing Diversity: The Approaches   Bairoh (2007) identifies three categories of approach that shape the theoretical and practical foundation of the discipline of diversity management. The approaches are classified as the practitioner/consultant approach, the mainstream approach and the critical approaches. These approaches also provide insights and rationale into the importance of incorporating diversity management as part of strategic goals and objectives of the organizations.    3.1. Practitioner/Consultant Approach   The paradigm presented by Thomas and Ely (1996) is an example of practitioner/consultant approach. Wilson (1997) offers a six level equity continuum ranging from No problems. (possible problems are not acknowledged nor attended to) to organizations being fully committed on maintaining and encompassing equity organization culture. Another common feature or this approach is based on business case logic i.e. to argue in favor of diversity management because of its positive impact on performance, effectiveness, as well as the anticipated economic benefits. Dietz and Petersen (2006) argue that there is an increasing shortage of qualified and talented staff and therefore organizations must exhaust all possible segments of the labor market, including minority employees. In addition, the customers demographic profile is increasingly diverse and thus matching employees to fit the clients demographic profile is seen as an important determinant of organizational success. Diversity could also improve productivity and encourage innovation to problem solving, archiving competitiveness and mitigate associated costs related to litigation (Lorbiecki and Jack 2000). Businesses should invest in creating a more effective diverse workforce not because it is the legal, ethical or moral right thing to do, but because it is the savvy, bottom-line-focused, pragmatic, self-interested right thing to do (Litvin 2006).   Common business case benefits of diversity are:          Increases understanding of different customers (since these are also diverse).  Boosts creativity and innovation as different viewpoints are brought forward.  Improves utilization of the competencies of all employees.  Strengthens commitment towards the employer/organization and decreases employee turnover.  Awakes more interest towards the organization among competent applicants.  Boosts image of the organization among various stakeholders.  Greater adaptability and flexibility in a rapidly changing marketplace.   Attract and retain the best talent.   Reduce costs associated with turnover, absenteeism and low productivity.   Return on investment (ROI) from various initiatives, policies and practices.   Gain and keep greater/new market share (locally and globally) with an expanded diverse customer base.  Increased sales and profits.     3.2. Mainstream Approach   Social Identity Theory and Self-Categorization Theory   Social identity theory can be described as a theory of group membership and behavior (Hogg et al., 1995). It is developed with the purpose of understanding how individuals make sense of themselves and other people in the social environment Korte (2007). Self-categorization exists when people stereotype themselves by attributing to themselves the attitudes, behaviors and other attributes they associate with membership in a particular group Kulik and Bainbridge (2006). According to Korte (2007), social identity theory and self-categorization theory are complementary theories explaining social identity, in term of its elements and processes. Through self-categorization and group membership, individuals develop a social identity, which serves as a social-cognitive schema (norms, values, and beliefs) for their group-related behavior. The perceiver is likely to see these characteristics as central to his or her own identity and therefore these characteristics are used to categorize others (Kulik and Bainbridge 2006). Stereotyping, prejudice, and conflict are critical consequences of social identity and self-categorization (Tajfel, 1982).   As the theory of social identify could provide a conceptual foundation for researchers in the examination of diversity, however it tends to lead diversity researchers to the study of power and inequality termed as minimal inter-group paradigm (Prasad et al. 2006). This paradigm suggests that all identity groups at all times engage in in-group bias and the bias is stronger in a high status group than a low status group. Furthermore, in-group bias practiced by highly privileged groups is likely to be decidedly more costly to historically disadvantaged groups than the reverse could ever be (Prasad et al. 2006). Prasad et al. (2006) suggest that while in-group bias and out-group discrimination are natural phenomenon of organizations, organizations should try to mitigate its effects.   Macro and Micro Models of Diversity Management   In their paper, Managing Diversity, Dietz and Petersen (2006) categorize diversity approaches to the macro or organizational-level approach and the micro approach that is based on psychological models of discrimination and inter-group relations.   At the macro level (organizational or business unit level) of analysis, diversity management is hypothesized to moderate the relationship between workforce diversity and performance. The leading models are Coxs model and Thomas and Elys model. Cox (1991, 2001) states that diversity management emerged in the late 1960s in pluralistic organizations and later evolved into multicultural organization. Pluralistic value minimizes prejudice, discrimination and inter-group conflicts. This model is further extended to include a five-step model toward becoming a multicultural organization. These are leaderships, research and measurement, education, alignment of management systems and follow-up. They are assumed to be more positive--or less negative--as the degree of diversity management increases.   The Thomas and Ely model focuses on the processes that diversity management affects the relationship between workforce diversity and organizational outcomes variables. They argue for three types of perspectives: discrimination-and-fairness, access-and-legitimacy and integration-and-learning. Workgroup functions the best under the integration-and-learning perspective where the positive effect is generated by the quality of inter-group relations, feelings of being valued and respected and the positive effect of employees racial identity at work (Thomas and Ely 1996).   However, Dietz and Petersen (2006) criticize that empirical research testing these macro level hypothesis remains sparse and the quality of the existing research lags behind that of the theoretical work. Instead, they propose to scale down the models to test only the core assumptions or components tested or to improve the empirical procedures.   At the micro level, based on social psychological theories, advocates that a critical component of diversity management is to understand and manage stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination (Dietz and Petersen 2006) and stereotypes and prejudices are considered immediate antecedents of discrimination. Dietz and Petersen (2006) argue that other social psychological processes e.g. the development of social identities and social categorizations, experience of realistic group conflict, contact with demographically different persons, and individual differences in social dominance orientation are more distal antecedents of discrimination than stereotypes and prejudices.   Dietz and Petersen (2006) state that empirical research indicates that prejudice still affects the treatment of demographically different employees in organizations although in more complex ways than 30 to 50 years ago. Subtle prejudice only leads to discriminatory behavior and inter-group conflict if justification factors are in place. In organizational settings, such justification factors often are readily available. Therefore, diversity management interventions against stereotypes and prejudices could aim at eliminating or reducing (1) negative stereotypes or prejudices, (2) justification factors, and (3) discrimination.   3.3. Critical Approaches   Prasad et al. (1997) complain that much of the management literature on workplace diversity tends to ignore or gloss over these dilemmas while continuing to stress the potency of workshops and training to accomplish the goals of workplace diversity. The discipline of diversity management is inadequately theorized and characterized by partisan approaches and universalist frameworks that render an adequate understanding of inequality and discrimination in the workplace problematic (Dick and Cassell 2002).   Discursive Approaches   Foucault, Fairclough and other discourse theorists inspire researches on diversity to be discursive-focus.   Definition of Diversity Management. According to Lorbiecki and Jacks (2000) critical discourse analysis in examining certain definitions of diversity management (especially the notion of difference), they find that managers tend to see diversity as an object to be managed. Managers start to draw a boundary around the managed diverse group allows diversity to be identified and controlled as it is located in one space (the different group). Lorbiecki and Jacks (2000) state that masking out the diversity of those who manage is also a control mechanism because it helps to erase any questionable human differences within this powerful group.   The essentialist assumptions of the mainstream theories. Litvin (1997) claims that exposure to managerial diversity discourse encourages individuals to view their co-workers in particular ways. She laments that socially constructed demographic categories are portrayed as obvious, natural and immutable and thus preclude any consideration of mechanisms for change. Lorbiecki and Jack (2000) also agree with this point that diversity is presented as being about fixed differences, implying no movement either within or across visible or invisible boundaries.   The Business Case arguments. Lorbiecki and Jack (2000) argue that diversity management has become programmable and it can be incorporated into the routines and procedures of HRM. Litvin (2006) even argues that the Business Case discourse derives its strength and position from the economical Mega-Discourse that enshrines the achievement of organizational economic goals as the ultimate guiding principle and explanatory device for people in organizations..   Power. Prasad et al. (2006) contend that mainstream researchers often neglect the study of power as part of diversity discussion. Foldy (2002) points out that managing diversity means managing identity and focusing too extensively on business case discourse businesses can ignore other imperatives such as the pursuit of fairness, and ignore persistent problems of discrimination and dominance.   Social Context. Prasad et al. (2006) point out that Crucial aspects of the context for understanding workplace diversity include the history and relative oppressive actions toward different groups, the legislation around access to education, work and health, human rights, the societal placing of diversity groups and the shifts in the salience of issues at different times, caused by the activism internationally and the local level Moreover, European researchers start to question the relevance of the Anglo-Saxon understanding of diversity management and its applicability in their own countries (e.g. Risberg and Sderberg (2004)) where multicultural societies e.g. the US, Canada, UK and Australia tend to have a greater tolerance and appreciation for diversity whereas same may not be true in less multicultural society.   Postcolonial Critique   Prasad and Prasad (2002) research diversity management in term of a postcolonial argument. They argue that the study of otherness and diversity in a globalized environment involves paying attention to the nexus of shifting identities and alignments that are brought together in the process of constituting the other, and the current geopolitical realities and global hegemonies that mediate the formation of identity spaces in organizational and institutional locations. Prasad and Prasad (2002) point out that neo-colonial and neo-imperial discourses of otherness continue to exist in diverse organizational environment, and that these discourses are produced both within and by organizations. For example, training programs that intend to assist organizational members in appreciating internal and external cultural differences may turn into sites for the systematic and problematic production of otherness.    4. Aligning Diversity to the Strategic Business Goals   In order to leverage the full potential benefits of diverse workforce, organizations are urged to realign the diversity management strategy to the overall business strategy and objectives of the organization. Described below are three steps required and necessary in aligning diversity to strategic business goals:    4.1. Define Diversity   Hubbard (2004) states that organizations need to clarify the role of workplace diversity, including leadership roles and expectations for diversity initiatives. In vision and mission statements, highlight the importance of diversity. Corporate websites could be used as a mean of communication, revealing its public statement of the organization's commitment to workplace diversity. It is also equally important to communicate commitment by allocating the necessary resources--staff, budgets and time--to move the diversity process forward.   ""Diversity policies lie as close to IBM's core as they have throughout our heritage,"" says Sam Palmisano, IBM chairman and CEO. ""Today we're building a workforce in keeping with the global, diverse marketplace, to better serve our customers and capture a greater share of the on demand opportunity.""   In Mitsubishi Electric, hiring a diverse array of people with respect for human rights and without regard for gender, age, nationality or race is essential to the ongoing business development of a multinational corporation. Based on this thinking, Mitsubishi Electric not only complies with the Labor Standards Law and the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, it provides equal treatment to all employees regardless of nationality, creed or social status, uses the same pay scale for men and women, and determines working conditions with equal standing given to employers and workers. These employment policies also apply to Group companies.    4.2. Establish Leadership Accountability   With the commitment of the senior management, HR diversity leaders should develop challenging yet realistic goals for diversity interventions (Hubbard 2004). Organization commitments need to be demonstrated through:    Appoint senior executives to diversity task forces for succession planning, education and training initiatives.  Recruit diversity candidates for senior leadership positions.  Establish diversity goals and objectives for all leadership levels in the performance management process and reward programs.     Reichenberg (2001) states that accountability for the results of diversity programs is an attribute of diversity best practice organizations. Accountability is determined through the use of metrics, surveys, focus groups, customer surveys, management and employee evaluations, and training and education evaluations. Diversity competencies may be incorporated into management systems so that organizations can determine how employees deal with people of different cultures and styles, support workplace diversity, include diverse people in work teams, and understand the impact of diversity on business relationships. In the best effort to achieve the goals of diversity, organizations must use measurable criteria to evaluate the progress of the initiative..    4.3. Develop and Operate a Diversity Scorecard System   The scorecard is an important tool to manage diversity (Hubbard 2004). The scorecard includes financial and non-financial recognition of diversity ROI initiatives as well as relevant feedback. The diversity scorecard shall include measures aligned with the organization's strategic business goals, or be part of the overall organizations balanced scorecard. When determining measures, these four themes are required to be considered:    Key deliverables that leverage the role of diversity in the organization's overall strategy.   Utilization of diversity in the development of a high-performance work environment.   Ways in which the corporate culture is aligned with the organization's strategy.   The efficiency of the diversity deliverables.     5. Diversity, HRM and Organization Performance   Diversity and HR   Organization diversity initiatives and diversity programs pose serious challenges to the HR practitioners (Porter 1995). In order to meet these challenges, it is essential to acquire top management commitment, the skilled training and breadth of organizational knowledge HR possesses, and a shared understanding that managing diversity is not an isolated problem to be solved but an ongoing and lengthy process. All three of these elements are needed to sustain people's willingness to work together when they do not share values, experiences, culture, and ways of interpreting meaning and solving problems (Zane 2002)   Bassett-Jones (2005) reveals the reason why workforce diversity is difficult to implement. It is mainly due to human beings prefers working in homogeneous groups and human beings and the organizations to which they belong resist change. Diversity's focus on changing human thought and behavior requires and defines HR's role in diversity management. Successful diversity management requires HR managers to possess skills in leadership, organizational development, change management, psychology, communication, measurement, and assessment (Kreitz 2008).   Diversity, HRM and Organization Performance   As HR often appears as an undifferentiated and homogeneous category, thus researches are more focus in the management, diversity business case and potential economic value that diversity could bring into the organization rather than HR. It can even be argued that diversity is excluded from the HRM domain, because notions of the abstract ideal worker, who has no body and therefore no gender, color, age and nationality (Acker, 1992), still prevail in HRM. However, such ignorance does not prevent the researchers from re-thinking HRM from the perspective of diversity, ultimately influencing the performance outcome of the organizations.   The HRM model presented by Paauwe and Richardson (1997) states that HRM activities give rise to HRM outcomes that will influence the performance of the firm. As a causal relationship, this works vice versa. Contingency and control variables, such as age, size, sector and technology, may influence the HRM activities, outcomes and performance in the model.   The other model suggested by Kossek and Lobel (1996) states that traditional HRM models foster workforce homogenization and similarity, and that this hinders the organizations ability to respond to important environmental changes. This prescribes that strategic decision on diversity management objectives should be built in before the design and implementation of HRM policies are decided.   Integrating Paauwe and Richardson and Kossek and Lobel models, Benschop (2001) proposes a new model that asserts that diversity strategy is driven by environmental factors, it influences HRM activities, and may therefore affect HRM outcomes and performance, whether for the individual, group or organization. However, she also notes that there is existence of debates in the HRM literature about the impact of HRM activities on organization performance (Guest 1997) and so is the discussion concerning the effects of diversity on performance (Cox, 1993).    6. Examining Global Diversity Management   While the literatures on workforce diversity cover a wide range of diversity issues in term of theoretical frameworks and empirical studies and how organization should approach the management of diverse workforce, the same may not be true about literatures in an international setting. With increasing impacts of globalization on organizations workforce, it is thus imperative to give an international perspective to managing diversity. It is now common to find multinational corporations (MNCs) plan, implement or evaluate some forms of diversity initiatives, not only in the US, but increasingly on an international scale (Wentling and Palma-Rivas 2000).   In essence, global diversity management is defined to relate to the management of workforces (citizens and immigrants) in different countries (Mor Barak 2005). It is management discipline that concern how effectively a global workforce can be managed in achieving competitive advantage and business benefits, while being influenced to a large extent by organizational strategy and pressures from local labour and product markets (Florkowski 1996). Mor Barak (2005) recognizes that the cultural dimension of diversity program has strong sensitivity when corporations faced different type of customers and markets and it could be used to solve problem related to multicultural teams, gaining new market shares and product development. This, effectively managing a global workforce is considered to be critical in achieving benefits for business and in sustaining international competitive advantage (Florkowski 1996) as well as workforce mobilization (Konrad 2003).   As the proportions of MNCs workforces located outside of their home country increases, the key challenge is how to leverage the diversity of a global workforce whilst maintaining consistency throughout the organization (Rosenzweig, 1998). In other words, cross-border diversity initiatives need to be locally meaningful (Schneider & Barsoux 2003). MNCs ought to focus on the impact of domestic and overseas legislation, languages, religions, ethnicity and cultural dimensions that affect working habits, labor composition, industrial relations and cross-border interaction as a whole.    6.1. MNCs Approaches to Global Diversity Management   Whilst empirical studies concerning how MNCs have approached global diversity management is scant, this section intends to discuss the MNCs strategies within the perspectives of strategic approaches, designs (what) and delivery (how) of global diversity management.   Strategic approaches   As the Strategic International Human Resource Managements (SIHRM) and International Human Resource Management (IHRM) model suggests, MNCs tend to adopt approaches that could reflect their overall international orientation, strategy and structure when dealing with global diversity management. This is supported by research of Egan and Bendick (2003) where they find that both global and multi-domestic strategies have been effectively applied, despite acknowledging that most of the surveyed US MNCs in fact adopted a strongly multi-domestic approach to diversity management. In such cases, corporate headquarters only offered broad guidance, resulting in differentiated diversity activities amongst foreign affiliates. This preference for multi-domestic approach is contended to due to the reluctance to identify global diversity management with American management practices, as well as the perceived complexity involved in developing and imposing globally uniform diversity programs.   The case study of Ferner et al. (2004) points out the shortcomings and weaknesses of an ethnocentrically-oriented approach (from the host-country perspectives) to integrating global diversity management policies. Jones et al. (2000) and Ferner et al. (2005) both agree that how US-derived models of diversity management have been perceived as inappropriate, resulting high levels of culturally- and institutionally-based resistance. Wentling and Palma-Rivas (2000) distinguish between the approaches of US MNCs in terms of macro-level activities which comprise the planning, goalsetting and prioritizing at corporate headquarter, and micro-level activities whereby host subsidiary managers implement their own version of diversity initiatives which reflect their subsidiary-specific needs. This follows that the global integration of diversity management cannot be effective and successful without significant local modification.   Designs   It has been empirically tested that whilst individual contents of diversity initiatives in MNCs can vary, there is often a close relationship between domestic and international agendas. For instance, Egan and Bendick (2003) attest to the similarities of domestic and international diversity agendas with four common features i.e. (1) a broad definition of diversity which incorporates the notion of inclusion, (2) motives for diversity management centering on the business case, (3) administrative structures used to facilitate diversity, and (4) the integration of diversity initiatives into wider organizational change programs. Wentling and Palma-Rivas (2000) report a similar relationship, identifying the shared features of firstly, the inclusion and full utilization of people as guiding principles, secondly the development of understanding and appreciation for cultural differences, and thirdly the adaptation of products and services to satisfy diverse customer needs. Ferner et al. (2005) state further that global diversity structures tend to develop out of existing domestic structures. Whilst they also acknowledge the broad definition of diversity, they also go on to identify the setting and monitoring of targets as well as the regular collection of diversity metrics, as part of the performance management process. Nevertheless, the collective similarities between domestic and international diversity initiative designs identified above still arguably represent distinctly US approaches to conceptualizing and managing the diversity of a global workforce.   Delivery   The growing scale and complexity of diversity management programs within MNCs would warrant sophisticated organizational mechanisms to implement them. A multiplicity of administrative structures has been reported in MNCs attempts to internationalize diversity management (Egan and Bendick 2003). The most common administrative structure is a diversity council which typically serves as an overarching taskforce, often at the corporate or global level, with the mandate of leading diversity efforts and providing guidance and support where necessary. Often time, the creation of the post of Chief Diversity Officer or Diversity Coordinator is not uncommon. These structures are also supported by organization-wide training interventions. Finally, in order to complement the top-down approach of diversity management, affinity groups for women or ethnic minority groups and broader diversity networks are formed to represent the voices of the employees.    6.2. IHRM and SIHRM Integration   When cross-border human resource issue is concerned, the roles of IHRM and SIHRM become important. The aim of IHRM is to contribute to the success of the MNCs by implementing its global strategy in parallel with creating sufficient flexibility to meet local conditions (Tayeb 2003). Schneider and Barsoux (2003) indicate that adaptation of HRM policies, practices and organizational culture to local environments is seen as crucial in managing local diversity to be locally fair and bias-free. However, in terms of global HR integration, locally differing and culturally contextual HR practices, philosophies or policies can make the integration of global diversity management complex due to its demographic, cultural and institutional embeddedness (Tayeb 1998).   Kim et al. (2003) find that MNCs use a combination of mechanisms with different levels of intensity in order to integrate, control and coordinate business functions on a global scale. They classify integration modes as people-based, information-based, formalization-based and centralization-based and find that people-based and information-based modes generally emerge as being most effective mechanisms. Besides, mutually supporting integrating mechanisms have been found useful in facilitating better acceptance of diversity (Gilbert & Ivancevich 2000). In practice of global diversity management, it is unclear which modes would be most appropriate. Indeed, it is also ambiguous whether HR should own this role of world-wide integration or should it be an overall business initiative (Sippola and Smale 2007).    7. The Challenges of Diversity Management   Many organizations are finding that the goal of creating a multicultural work culture that both welcomes and leverages diversity remains elusive. However, efforts of promoting workforce diversity has been challenging in the practical way. Why past efforts have failed? There are three main reasons why many past efforts have been disappointing: (1) misdiagnosis of the problem, (2) wrong solution (that is, failure to use a systemic approach), and (3) failure to understand the shape of the learning curve for leveraging diversity work.   In addition, Metzler (2003) lists the ten reasons why diversity initiatives fail: 1. Failure to address the deeper issues of discrimination and marginalization. 2. Failure to view diversity as organizational change. 3. Failure to examine how much change an organization can accommodate and in what increments. 4. Failure to address systemic issues such as organization's practices, policies, procedures and unwritten informal rules. 5. Failure to clearly and comprehensively articulate why an organization is devoting time, effort and resources to a diversity initiative. 6. Failure to engage white men in diversity discussion involving blacks or minority group. 7. Poor diversity training and education. 8. Lack of authentic diversity leadership. 9. Selecting incompetent consultants. 10. Lack of accountability.    8. Conclusion   It is acceptable to state that there is no ""best way"" to manage diversity. The execution of the workforce diversity concept could be vastly different from country to country, from company to company. The very success of its implementation is depending on business needs and workforce issues as well as situational factors, such as the organizational culture and workplace environment. While a broad range of issues is covered, it should be noted that ""one size does not fit all"" as organizations are in different stages of development regarding workplace diversity. Ultimately, the strength of commitment by the CEO, senior management and HR leadership will determine whether the organization successfully leverages workforce diversity, in achieving competitive advantage.

There are many definitions of ""diversity management"", and numerous terms are used to describe essentially the same thing. For instance, there are various definitions of ""diversity"", ""productive diversity"", ""diversity management"" and ""workplace diversity"". In a pragmatic sense, the common ground in these definitions includes:   they acknowledge the reality that people differ in many ways;   they identify implications for the workplace, or society generally, that arise because of the diversity; and   they suggest or imply strategies to ensure that these issues are addressed, in the interest of the workplace, or society generally.    Diversity management is a tool for capturing the diversity dividend. Diversity management focuses on managing the difference within a company’s workforce, capitalising on the benefits of diversity and minimising workplace challenges.    Diversity management contributes significantly to the bottom line. The main ways diversity management produces the diversity dividend are: improving the efficiency of HRM functions;   fostering superior decision-making, problem-solving, creativity, and innovation; key factors in the creation of knowledge companies;   developing cross-cultural capabilities that facilitate operations in culturally complex environments at home and abroad; and    implementing new product/service developments and new sales/marketing strategies for diverse customer bases.    There are two distinct but connected channels in diversity management, which will lead to superior company performance. The first channel focuses on how to tap into the benefits that flow from effectively managing diversity. The second channel focuses on corrective strategies to address ineffective diversity management, which imposes costs.    Effective diversity management leads to improved individual and organisational performance. This is due to the powerful effects of diversity on problem-solving, decision-making, innovation and creativity.    However, having a diverse workforce does not, in itself, translate into bottom line benefits for companies. Diversity must be managed in order for companies to reap a diversity dividend. Companies must commit to effectively managing diversity to ensure that the unique skills, perspectives and knowledge of their workforces are channelled into producing a diversity dividend.       Diversity and Sustainability    Traditional approaches to diversity used to primarily refer to how companies addressed legislative and regulatory issues of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action related to race, gender and disability. Today, companies have expanded their understanding and approach to diversity.    Firstly, they have broadened their understanding of what constitutes difference so that diversity is about acknowledging any difference that can impact on the fair or equitable treatment of people - this can include differences in gender, race, age, culture, disability, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that helps to shape a person's perspective. Diversity in this context can encompass any way people differ.    Secondly, companies have begun to capitalise on differences and extract the value to the business that can be gained from acknowledging, valuing and developing the business opportunities that arise from this difference.    In this context, productive diversity is a strategy and approach that sees the positive opportunities for business from a diverse workforce, marketplace and supplier base. Businesses that embrace a productive diversity model take advantage of these opportunities to enhance their competitive edge and deliver value and increased returns for shareholders.

Now What?      Now that the interview is over, it's time to swing into action with some  memorable followup activities.     By Tracy Laswell Williams, CPRW President, CAREERMagic        Congratulations!  You've just completed an interview for a position that interests you, or perhaps you met with a networking contact who offered some insight into your job search. Now that the interview is over, it's time to swing into action with some memorable followup activities. Depending on the nature of your interview, followup can take several forms. What you do can greatly influence whether you succeed in generating a second interview or benefit from your networking meeting. Review the checklist below for specific activities that may apply to you.                                       Thank you note.  A thank you note should be sent immediately following an interview to each person with whom you met. A thank you note may be handwritten if it is brief (the ""bread and butter"" thank yous our mothers taught us when we were children). However, a more effective followup is a wordprocessed letter that reinforces the points you made during the interview and reiterates your qualifications for the position. Thank you notes should always be personalized. If you are writing to more than one person at a company following a group or successive interview, do not send the same note to each; vary your missives so that the person reading it knows you recall and related to the specific information they provided.     Preparation of additional information/documentation.  During the interview, did you offer to put together a rough outline of a marketing idea you discussed? Were you asked to forward your college transcripts? Did you volunteer to send a great article you'd read about manufacturing in rural areas? Be prompt, precise, and proactive in providing additional material that may help support your candidacy. You may cover these materials with a brief handwritten note or your business card with a word or two jotted on the back.    Followup phone calls.  It is perfectly appropriate to follow up with the interviewer after a period of time to determine the status of the position and your candidacy. One of your final questions at the end of your interview might be, ""When may I expect to hear from you? May I check back with you in two weeks?"" Enter the date in your calendar and follow up as promised.    Continued networking.  A successful networking interview should result in additional contact names. Follow through on all leads, and give occasional status updates to the person who originally referred you.    In all your followup activities, be sure to spell the person's name correctly and use his or her correct title. If you failed to get a business card during the interview, call the person's office to check on the name. It's a simple matter to say, ""I'm sending a letter to Mr. Yastrzemski. Would you verify the spelling of his name for me?"" You do not need to identify yourself in these calls, but if you enjoyed a friendly chat with a secretary or receptionist, it would be a good idea to call that person directly, identify yourself, and ask for his or her help. This is another way to keep your name and candidacy in the forefront.   Prompt, polite followup is an indicator of good business etiquette and will help to set you apart from candidates who do not follow up. Be sure you do all you can and all you've promised to cement yourself and your candidacy with potential employers. And if you need help with letter writing or have business etiquette questions, drop us an e-mail! We'll be happy to help you shine even after the interview.           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Career Article Written & Contributed to The Career Exposure Network by:  Tracy Laswell Williams, accredited resume writer and career consultant who  works with a diverse client base nationwide.

Actually, I’m betting you did. You’re a go-getter. An alpha dog. The type of person who makes a goal, reaches it, and excels far beyond everyone’s expectations. And now, you’re setting yourself up for the GMAT. The all-important test that’s going to hopefully get you into the business school of your dreams. Well, not “hopefully”. You don’t hope. You  prepare . Well, good. This page is going to help you do just that.     What Is the GMAT?   This standardized test, used for admissions into graduate business and management programs around the globe, is a computer-adaptive assessment of the skills you need to be successful in grad school. Since hundreds of prospective grad students from various backgrounds, ethnicities, cultures, and undergrads are vying for positions in the top business schools around the country, the GMAT provides a reliable method of choosing the most qualified applicants without fear of favoring one person over another. It’s universal.    What Is on The GMAT?   Don’t sweat it. You’re going to do great on this thing – you always do, right?    Here’s what the GMAT measures:     Verbal Reasoning:  In a nutshell  - Can you read? Can you identify complex relationships between words and concepts? Do you understand the different parts of a sentence? Can you put together an answer from a passage you’ve dissected? Let’s hope so.   Quantitative Reasoning:  In a nutshell – How’s your algebra? Geometry? Arithmetic? Quantitative reasoning? Math may be your strong point, but it’s a good idea to brush up those skills anyway.    Analytical Writing:  In a nutshell – How good are you at explaining what you mean? Can you clearly support your ideas with evidence, reasons, and examples? Can you creatively focus your ideas into a well-organized, carefully-spelled, and grammatically correct composition?  This section accounts for one full hour of the test, so you should prepare yourself accordingly.    Here’s what it doesn’t measure:     Knowledge of business  Specific content from your undergraduate course work  Your creativity  Your work ethic  Your motivation  Job skills     How Are the GMAT Sections Broken Down?   Schedule about three hours and thirty minutes for the test. You’ll have some optional breaks in there, but the testing will take you about that long. You’ll begin the test with Analytical Writing, continue with Quantitative work, and end with Verbal Reasoning. Here’s how it will look:   GMAT Sections      How Does the GMAT Scoring Work?   In truth, it’s complicated, especially because both the Quantitative and Verbal sections are computer-adaptive. The questions given to you reflect how you did on preceding questions and the requirements of the test design. So, if you’re answering all of the questions correctly, you’re going to start getting harder questions with more points available to snag.      When you finish the GMAT and get your official score report, you’ll see the four scores listed below. If you’re chomping at the bit to find out what you’ve done, you can record your scores after your testing session and receive the unofficial Verbal, Quantitative, and Total scores, but not the Analytical Writing, because it is scored independently.      Analytical Writing:  Can earn you between a 0 and a 6 in half-point increments. The mean score is a 4.42  Quantitative:  Can earn you between 0 and 60 points. Scoring less than a 7 and above a 50 is rare. The average is right around a 37.  Verbal:  Can earn you between 0 and 60 points. Scoring less than a 9 and above a 44 is rare. The average is right around a 28.  Total Score: Can earn you between 200 and 800 points. Most test-takers score between 400 and 600, but your score needs to be considerably higher than that if you’re going to a  top-ranking business school  like Harvard or Wharton.   How Do You Prepare for the GMAT?  MBA.com offers  free prep software  for registered users of its website. The feedback from people who have used the course is positive overall.  Plus, you can try these options:      Downloadable Practice GMAT:  For the cost of a meal at Outback Steakhouse (forty bucks), you can download a practice GMAT, take timed GMAT essays, and get a detailed score report from  800score.com . Practice makes perfect, right?  Tutors:   Kaplan  offers private tutoring and a guarantee – if you don’t score higher after using the tutoring, you get your money back. It’s as simple as that. And as costly, too. Private tutoring will set you back some big bucks, but if it means getting into the MBA program you’d prefer, it might be worth the extra dime.   Books: Good old-fashioned paper is the way to go, especially if you need a little more face-time with the questions and solutions.  The Official Guide for GMAT® Review, 11th Edition  offers excellent GMAT questions with answers, and tips for getting you to the score you’d like.     You’ve come so far. Now, all you need to do is ace the GMAT and get on with your life. Good luck to you!     GMAT Sections         Related Articles GMAT Scores: How Important Is Your GMAT Score?

Leading organizations acknowledge that working successfully with others who don't share the same background, beliefs, or traditions is a top priority in today's workplace. Employees need help in assessing their behavior toward people who are different from themselves. And they must understand the benefits of changing negative attitudes and resistance into appreciation and cooperation. The Discovering Diversity Profile ® allows individuals to explore their own viewpoints on workforce diversity in four key areas, and can help transform resistance into acceptance, cooperation, and respect.

So, it's not strange that people in the same company are from different countries, speaking different languages. Cultural diversity naturally exists out there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cultural diversity is nothing new. Cultural diversity includes differences in national origin, race, ethical, language and religion. Managing or working with people from various cultures and subcultures groups can be both interesting and stimulating. However, it can also be stressful, confusing and frustrating when we do not understand what they are trying to communicate. Effective communication between people of different culture is one of the key factors to any organization success. When individuals from different cultures do not understand each other, it blames it on the others. To communicate effective with persons who are culturally different from ourselves, we need to learn not only about other cultures but also our own. Cultural understanding may minimise the impact of culture shock, and maximise intercultural experiences, as well as increase professional development and organisation effectives. Cultural sensitivity also teaches us that culture and behaviour are relative, and that we should be more tentative, and less absolute in human interactions. In today highly complex and competitive business environment managing diversity at work become more important if business organization want to be successful. Organizations who fail to realise the important of cultural diversity at work will paid for heavy prices, especially for organization that expatriates had been sent on foreign assignments. As studies had shown that between 16 to 40% of expatriates return before they are supposed to be due to poor performance or inability to effectively adjust to the new work place due to cultural diversity. About the Author: T.K. Lee has strong interest in the studies of communication, especially in cross cultural communication at cultural diversity work place. In his final year thesis he had studied on the topics on The Importance of Understanding Intercultural Communication in the Australias & Singapores Construction Industry.

For many interviewers, the job interview thank you letter is a simple note or communication that does not receive much attention. The candidate comes home from the interview, goes to the computer, cuts and pastes a thank you letter and sends it without much change or thought. Unfortunately, those  candidates who do this miss a prime opportunity to advance their candidacy.  Written correctly, a job interview thank you has the ability to set you apart from the crowd, to create a warmer relationship with the interviewer, highlight some attractive characteristics about yourself and make the interviewer look forward to your next communication.    The difference between the ineffective job interview thank you and the effective one is the addition of the simple concept of the informational gift. The informational gift is a small tidbit of information, advice or knowledge that the interviewer can use or appreciate. This does not have to be a big, world-changing piece of information either. Something like the name of a restaurant, a link to a website or a contact person would make a very acceptable informational gift under the right circumstances. The way to pick the informational gift is to pay close attention to the interviewer during your interview. During your talk he or she is likely to do or say something that will reveal an area in which he or she is extremely interested. Once you know what that area is, you simply find some piece of knowledge about that to include in your thank you note.    Your Job Interview Thank you Strategy   Writing your job interview thank you with an informational gift means taking that same thank you note that you have always sent, and simply adding two elements. The first element is an explanation of the reason you are sending the informational gift. This puts the gift into context and reminds him or her of the part of the interview that tipped you off of his or her interests. For instance, you could say something like ""During our interview, I appreciated hearing about your company's new virtual reality design studio. That reminded me of an article I read about a similar studio at another company, and how they have found a way to use it in new and unexpected ways. I've attached that article and I hope that you find it as interesting as I do.""   Other elements to make sure that you include in your job interview thank you are to express appreciation for the interview, to express continued interest in the position, to make a final sales pitch, and to invite further conversation. A sample job interview thank you would go something like this ""thanks for your time and attention last Friday. I appreciate the chance to learn more about the company and the opening. The more I heard the more I felt that this is exactly the opening I have been looking for. I was particularly excited to hear about the chance to work with the technical team. Coming from that environment, I have been looking for a way to use my technical expertise in combination with my salesmanship skills.

It can be a simple thank you note or it can be a piece of strategic communication designed to help get you the job. If you want it to be a thank you note, this it will express gratitude to the interviewer for the interview. If you want it to be a strategic communication, it will do that, plus many more tasks, including highlight your most attractive qualities, create a warmer relationship with the interviewer, make a final sales pitch for your candidacy, suggest a future interview and teach the interviewer that communications from you are likely to contain valuable information. Best of all, the strategic communication is not inherently harder to write than a thank you note. Here's a step-by-step guide.   Your post job interview thank you note advantage starts during the job interview. During your conversation, pay as close attention as you can to the subjects, topics or items that the interviewer appears to be interested in. If he or she makes some kind of statement which tips you off that he or she is either personally or professionally intrigued by a topic or subject make a mental note of that. After the interview, be sure to get his or her business card and to turn your mental note into a written note about the object of the interviewer's attentions. That information will come in very handy when you start writing your thank you note.     Your Post Job Interview Thank You Strategy   Your post job interview thank you note will start like most other notes. As a general rule, these note contain an expression of gratitude, an expression of further interest in the position, a final sales pitch for the job, an offer to meet again and a sign off. For instance, a note might read ""Thank you for your time on Thursday. I appreciate the chance to learn more about the position. The more I discover about the company and the opportunity, the more interested I am in working for your company. I really feel that I can make a contribution to your technology department, and put the programming experience I have gained at my current job to excellent use for you. Please feel free to give me a call to set up another interview as the hiring process moves forward."" The next part is when you begin to differentiate yourself from the pack, though.   You set yourself apart from the rest of the candidates by adding an element to the post job interview note called the informational gift. This is a piece of information that you find about the topic of interest to the interviewer. Preface the gift with an explanation of why you are sending it, reminding the interviewer of what he or she said to tip you off that this topic would be interesting. Whether it is a website address, a contact name and number or a link to a published article, sending this informational gift shows that you paid close attention to the conversation you had and that you are the kind of person who provides other people with what they want without direction. Further, this informational gift shows that any further communications from you are also likely to contain valuable or at least interesting information.

I enjoyed learning about [company x] and telling you about my goals for the future. Try not to make it to formal. A lot of HR people these days are calling interviews meetings, you should do the same.                                                                   Step 2           Make a personal connection What was it about the interviewer that you liked? At the end of the behavioral part, when you get the do you have any questions for me? you should have made it personal by asking what they like in the company, what are their goals, what is the team like, etc etc.  You should remember something that the interviewer told you that inspired you. Got it? Great! Now say this: I really liked how youre so focused on helping your team-members reach their goals. Dont try to fluff too much, because you do, the interviewer will see through it. You dont have to say its so inspiring to me and thank you. That will most likely NOT get you hired.                                                                   Step 3           Short Sale!  There is no need to summarize your strengths again. They already met you right? But you still want to ask for the job, because you want to be a little assertive, without being aggressive. So do it in one simple sentence. I look forward to joining your team in the future.                                                                                                                                                               Tips & Warnings                feel free to add a little more information without fluffing or over-selling yourself.

That sounds simple, but diversity encompasses race, gender, ethnic group, age, personality, cognitive style, tenure, organizational function, education, background and more.          Diversity not only involves how people perceive themselves, but how they perceive others. Those perceptions affect their interactions. For a wide assortment of employees to function effectively as an organization, human resource professionals need to deal effectively with issues such as                      communication, adaptability and change. Diversity will increase significantly in the coming years. Successful organizations recognize the need for immediate action and are ready and willing to spend resources on managing diversity in the workplace now.      Benefits of Workplace Diversity    An organization success and competitiveness depends upon its ability to embrace diversity and realize the benefits. When organizations actively assess their handling of workplace diversity issues, develop and implement diversity plans, multiple benefits are reported such as:    Increased adaptability    Organizations employing a diverse workforce can supply a greater variety of solutions to problems in service, sourcing, and allocation of resources. Employees from diverse backgrounds bring individual talents and experiences in suggesting ideas that are flexible in adapting to fluctuating markets and customer demands.   Broader service range    A diverse collection of skills and experiences (e.g. languages, cultural understanding) allows a company to provide service to customers on a global basis.    Variety of viewpoints    A diverse workforce that feels comfortable communicating varying points of view provides a larger pool of ideas and experiences. The organization can draw from that pool to meet business strategy needs and the needs of customers more effectively.    More effective execution    Companies that encourage diversity in the workplace inspire all of their employees to perform to their highest ability. Company-wide strategies can then be executed; resulting in higher productivity, profit, and return on investment.    Challenges of Diversity in the Workplace    Taking full advantage of the benefits of diversity in the workplace is not without its challenges. Some of those challenges are:    Communication  - Perceptual, cultural and language barriers need to be overcome for diversity programs to succeed. Ineffective communication of key objectives results in confusion, lack of teamwork, and low morale.    Resistance to change  - There are always employees who will refuse to accept the fact that the social and cultural makeup of their workplace is changing. The ee always done it this waymentality silences new ideas and inhibits progress.    Implementation of diversity in the workplace policies  - This can be the overriding challenge to all diversity advocates. Armed with the results of employee assessments and research data, they must build and implement a customized strategy to maximize the effects of diversity in the workplace for their particular organization.    Successful Management of Diversity in the Workplace  - Diversity training alone is not sufficient for your organization diversity management plan. A strategy must be created and implemented to create a culture of diversity that permeates every department and function of the organization.    Recommended steps that have been proven successful in world-class organizations are:    Assessment of diversity in the workplace  - Top companies make assessing and evaluating their diversity process an integral part of their management system. A customizable employee satisfaction survey can accomplish this assessment for your company efficiently and conveniently. It can help your management team determine which challenges and obstacles to diversity are present in your workplace and which policies need to be added or eliminated. Reassessment can then determine the success of you diversity in the workplace plan implementation.    Development of diversity in the workplace plan  - Choosing a survey provider that provides comprehensive reporting is a key decision. That report will be the beginning structure of your diversity in the workplace plan. The plan must be comprehensive, attainable and measurable. An organization must decide what changes need to be made and a timeline for that change to be attained.    Implementation of diversity in the workplace plan  - The personal commitment of executive and managerial teams is a must. Leaders and managers within organizations must incorporate diversity policies into every aspect of the organization function and purpose. Attitudes toward diversity originate at the top and filter downward. Management cooperation and participation is required to create a culture conducive to the success of your organization plan.    Recommended diversity in the workplace solutions include:    Ward off change resistance with inclusion.  -  Involve every employee possible in formulating and executing diversity initiatives in your workplace.    Foster an attitude of openness in your organization.  -  Encourage employees to express their ideas and opinions and attribute a sense of equal value to all.    Promote diversity in leadership positions.  -  This practice provides visibility and realizes the benefits of diversity in the workplace.    Utilize diversity training.  - Use it as a tool to shape your diversity policy.    Launch a customizable employee satisfaction survey that provides comprehensive reporting.  -  Use the results to build and implement successful diversity in the workplace policies.

As few as 21% of           these individuals indicate that they may be           fully engaged . At the same time,           increased global competition has caused many           organizations to reduce headcount in order           to cut costs. How, then, do we improve our           team performance,  and  increase           productivity, innovation and our           bottom-line?                                      Leveraging the true         power of diversity inside your teams, to engage your         employees and gain your competitive edge has never         been more important.                   Workplace Diversity: The Team Advantage/span>          is designed to improve the ability of your workforce         to engage and interact more effectively with         co-workers who are different than themselves, and to         learn the characteristics and value of High         Performing Teams.                   Four courses in  The Team Advantage/b>          series leverage multimedia technology to create an         individualized and highly interactive learning         environment. The program engages the employee with a         virtual workgroup of individuals who are diverse in         many ways and have just been assigned to a new team         to develop a high performance initiative for their         company. Each course is a 30-45 minute interactive         learning experience of realistic workplace dynamics.                                   Module 1:           High         Performing Teams                   Participants engage         with their new irtual teamand begin to explore         the definitions, characteristics and skills         associated with High Performance Teams and         Organizations, and why this training is important to         the bottom-line impact of any and every         organization. Barriers to teamwork are presented, in         addition to a discussion about workforce engagement         and commitment in general as well as within the         participant specific organization.                           Module 2:                   Strengthening Diverse Teams                   As the team begins to         become more comfortable in their new setting, they         explore some basic concepts about diversity, and         begin to learn that leveraging their diversity of         experience and strengths can lead to increased         performance. We begin to see that iltersapplied         to our daily task performance can hinder a High         Performing Team, and this fresh insight leads into         discussing potential barriers to success, managing         assumptions, the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion         of team members and the shared responsibility of         on-boarding new employees and setting team norms.                           Module 3:           Interpersonal Skills & Constructive Feedback                   One of the most         critical tasks of any High Performing Team is         establishing a competent set of interpersonal skills         ~ communicating effectively. Working together in a         team environment may be challenging, but the         irtual teamlearns more about handling conflict         and addressing tough issues. Participants learn         several tools to help them through this process,         including the BICA model for providing feedback, the         concept of Intent versus Impact, addressing         inappropriate remarks and behavior, as well as         establishing norms of support for each other.                           Module 4:           Team Skills & Accountability                   In the final module,         the team brings all of their learning together and         focuses on skills specifically important to a High         Performing Team environment, including developing         skills necessary for listening and hearing ideas and         solutions of others, problem solving and making         decisions. The participants finally learn to engage         their team in developing an inclusive culture of         feedback, mutual accountability and contributing to         the development of others, by directly addressing         inherent prejudicial iltersthat hold us back         from truly becoming a High Performing Team. In         conclusion, each participant develops an         interactive, personalized Action Plan.          Workplace         Diversity: The Team Advantage /span>          Goes Beyond Education! Measure Attitudes, Beliefs         and Behavior in eal-Time          One of         the most innovative aspects of The Team Advantage is         that in addition to providing an engaging,         interactive learning experience for participants         with premium content, it also has the capability of         surveying your employees while they are learning!

Length of your letter      Keep it to a brief page . Don't stress over it too much - it's more important just to send something quickly than to delay doing it for days.    Personalize each letter      When interviewing with several people at one organization, take a few seconds between interviews to jot down some notes about each conversation. Use these notes when writing individualized thank you letters to each interviewer.   When sending letters to several people at an organization, each letter does not need to be completely different from the rest. But don't send identical letters to several people - your letters will generally all end up in your file in the Human Resources department.    Content of your letter      Thank the interviewer for his or her time, and reiterate your interest in the job and your enthusiasm for the company.   Whenever possible, say something that will help your interviewer remember you as an individual from amongst all the candidates:    1. addressing a topic of particular interest (to your interviewer or to you) that arose during the conversation, especially where that topic reflects favorably on your job-related skills (for example, you talked for 15 minutes about the mountaineering trip you led last summer or your research on the health care industry); OR:    2. addressing an interviewer's specific concern in greater detail than was possible during the actual interview (for example, the interviewer seemed concerned that you did not have the quantitative skills necessary for the job); OR:    3. re-emphasizing a skill or strength important to that interviewer (for example, the interviewer showed a particular interest in your sports and team-related activities); OR: inserting a little humor into the process.    Other tips      Ask for your interviewers' business cards , or write down the interviewers' titles and the proper spelling of their names before leaving the interview site.   Carefully proof read each letter  and  have one other person do so, too.   Print each letter on a  high quality  linen or bond paper  (available at most copy centers), in white, off-white, cream or  light  gray, and mail them in matching envelopes.    E-mail vs. U.S. mail    The following is a summary of employer responses to this question, as posed by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. Three out of the four employers responding said that an e-mail thank-you note is acceptable. One said that thank-you notes should be sent by mail. Here's what each said:      One employer said that e-mail from students is  very welcome . Students should use the same formal wording in their e-mail that they use when sending correspondence through the U.S. Postal Service, the employer said, although e-mail shouldn't sound like a form letter. Students should include a few comments or highlights from the interview, and then close by stating an interest in the position and company. Many students do not use thank-you notes anymore, the employer added. And the lack of courtesy is disappointing. The employer noted that the lack of a thank-you note can factor in the hiring decision. If a job candidate cannot find the time to write a brief note, the employer says, how can he or she apply attention to detail and/or protocol on the job?   A second employer said that thank-you notes  should not  be sent via e-mail. The employer backs up this opinion by quoting from etiquette professionals who say all thank-you notes should be sent via U.S. mail. The reason? A letter is more personal.   A third employer said that it is appropriate to respond with e-mail. Hiring is moving at a quicker pace, so e-mail seems to be more effective at times. The form of the e-mail is not critical; however, the subject line should say 'Interview Follow-up' or 'Thank you for the Interview.' Sincere notes are preferred. This employer looks for the candidate who asks for the job!   The final employer said that when sending e-mail resumes and cover letters, applicants should follow the same guidelines as for paper correspondence.

The Law of the Past   One of the curious things that seem to hold people back from getting organized is wanting to avoid dealing with things left over from the past. Working your way through the clutter can bring you face to face with past mistakes and failures. The best thing to do is face them, learn from them, and then really put them behind you, in the past.   The Law of Time   Many people use the excuse of I just dont have enough time to get organized. If you really dont have enough time to get organized, then you desparately need to get organized! While it does take some time and energy to get organized, it also brings the gift of adding much more time to your life.   The Law of 3-D   When something comes your way, a memo, an announcement, a piece of mail, whatever, there are three and only three things you can do with it to remain organized:   1) Do it:2) Delegate it:3) Dump it: get it to the nearest trash receptacle and out of the way.   The Law of SYSTEM   Having a system, a step by step repeatable plan, for just about everything you do is simply invaluable. This is because SYSTEM stands for:   Saves-You-Some -Time-Energy-Money.   The Law of Stay   Once you get organized, do what ever it takes to stay organized. It takes a lot less time to stay organized than to get organized all over again. Trust me on this one.   The Law of  Freedom   Most of us who are organizationally challenged have resisted organization because we dont want to be controlled by anything or anyone. Quite the opposite is true, however. Getting organized allows you to experience more freedom and control than you thought possible.   The Law of Simplicity   Whatever system of organization you use, make sure you keep it simple. The more simple and easy  to use, the more likely you are to use it.   The Law of Put Your Hands On It   You can tell you are getting organized when you need to find something and you can immediately put your hands on it. Saves time.   The Law of Place   Remember the old cliche a place for everything and everything in its place? The reason it became a cliche is that it works.

However, an  AccountTemps Survey  reported that 88% percent of executives said they consider a thank you note influential when evaluating candidates.  52% of executives said they preferred a hand-written note, while 44% recommended email.  Another 3% would like to receive both an email and a written thank you note.   It's important to note that about half of applicants don't send a thank you note after an interview.  So, if you're one of the applicants who does spend a few minutes taking the time to send a thank you note to your interviewers it will be worth the effort.

clueweb09-en0011-09-33218	"                          home  |      site index   |      about us   |      contact information                                                                                           Search                                                                 Following Up                                   Following up means taking action and not waiting for the job to come            to you. Follow up shows your interest, your initiative and your sense            of responsibility — qualities that employers love! It means thanking            employers after interviews and calling them after applying for jobs.            Here are some suggestions to follow up successfully.                                           Phone Calls           Any calls to employers should be positive, brief and infrequent. Do            not bug the secretary; it only hurts your chances!           After Applying           A week or so after you submit your application or résumé            for a position, follow-up to check its status.                        Identify yourself and the position you've applied for.                                        Ask if the employer received everything you sent and if everything              is in order.                                        Ask when interviewing might begin.                     After the Interview           After you've sent the thank you note, wait a few days before you call.                        Identify yourself and the position you seek.                                        Ask when the decision might be made and if the employer needs anything              else from you.                     Thank You Notes           Thank you notes can get you jobs but most people still don't write            them. Be different! Send thank you notes after the interview, after            an information interview, after an especially helpful phone call —            whenever you like.                                                                                                                              ""When you get right down to the root of the meaning of                      the word 'succeed,' you will find it simply means to follow                      through.""                     F.W. Nichol                                                                                                 After the Interview           Send a thank you note within 24 hours after the interview. Mail it,            fax it or hand-deliver it depending on how much time you have before            the employer makes the decision. Make your note handwritten, typed or            emailed depending on the mode of communication the company prefers.                     To maximize its effect, say more than ""thanks"" in your note.                        Repeat your interest in the job or say that you want to withdraw              from consideration.                                        Emphasize or correct a point that you made earlier.                                        Add information you forgot to say in the interview.                     Be careful, though. A sloppy thank you note can do more harm than good.            For more about contacting employers  after the            interview .           After the Job Fair           Job fairs are a little unusual. You may get a mini-interview with a            recruiter but since you didn't go through the usual screening process,            follow up is necessary. In this situation, the thank you note is more            like a  cover letter .           Send a thank you note that:                        identifies the position you seek;                                        expresses your interest in the job;                                        explains how it would benefit the employer to hire you;                                        includes a copy of your résumé tailored for that              job.
