Cell phone providers such as Cingular are offering and developing more specialized services, features and possibilities all the time. Cingular advances the development of the industry by consistently being in the mind set to work to provide the latest in equipment so that cell phone users can accomplish more with their phone than they ever could. With the excellent versatility of today's cell phone, it can be much more than just a phone.  A  Cingular cell phone  can additionally be a gaming system, a music player, a television and even a digital camera.                            There are typically more than one cell phone user per U.S. household, and a steadily growing collection of families are using their cell phone as their only phone. Especially if you are thinking about making your Cingular cell phone your only phone, or in the event you are strictly looking for a new one, there are issues to look into so you can make an informed cell phone purchase.      Features and Benefits:  Remaining mindful of more practical features can be just as or more necessary than looking at the fun things like cameras, games, and music players. understand the more functional aspects of a particular cell phone too, including volume controls, an easily muted ringer,  and durability. If you would like a device with web and organizer capabilities, make certain that the system on the phone is easy to use and adjustable to your needs.       Phone Arrangement:  Whenever you can, visit a Cingular store and handle and hold the cell phone you are considering. Be certain that you can comfortably access the bulk of keypad with one hand. Make a test call if you can. Access the menu items on working demos and make sure that the way the cell phone is arranged is one you are happy with. The cell phone's size can affect the size of the keys, and if you have big hands, they could be difficult to use comfortably.       Display   Even though color screen displays are easily seen in dim light, or even no light at all, they frequently poorly perform in direct daylight. Ask the representative in the store if you can use the phone outdoors or under bright light.   Look at signal strength and battery indicators to make certain they are clearly visible. If knowing who is calling is significant to you, find out the way each phone you are looking at makes that known. If you are interested in a flip phone, consider whether or not an exterior incoming call display is a feature you need.     Price:  Depending on the Cingular phone plan you decide on, and the possibilities that you're looking into, there are phones available for very little, hundreds of dollars, or even free. Be sure to determine exactly what price range you can afford.      No matter  which  cell phone model you decide on, you should be happy with the features it has and the way it looks. With the progression of today's cell phone technology, you are sure to find one that best suits you and your busy life.

Browse through reviews below       to find the top GPS.                          Here are some quick tips when buying GPS:   High resolution images on a size screen that makes sense for your application (car, hiking, etc.) will provide the best experience.  Big screen high end units can come with 640 x 480 displays which was a common resolution on 15 inch computer displays.  Enhanced accuracy circuitry like WAAS and SBAS get mixed reviews for actual added accuracy however you can always turn them off.

For a good price, it combines handsome good looks with an outstanding screen and performance that's appropriate for its class.

The result is as near a perfect netbook as current technology will allow, at a $499 price thats right in line with lesser rivals in the class.      The Airstream-esque metal skin of HP's earlier Mini 2133 and  EliteBook  models carries over to the Mini 2140. The casing looks and feels fantastic and makes the Mini 2140 lighter and more impervious to scratches than plastic-bodied models. Measuring 1.0x10.3x6.5 inches (HWD) and weighing 2.6 pounds, the Mini 2140 is both smaller and lighter than our other favorite 10-inch netbooks, the  ASUS Eee PC 1002HA  and the  Samsung NC10 . Port selection is typical for a netbook, with one notable addition: Along with two USB ports, Ethernet, VGA, headphone and mic jacks, and an SD slot, you also get a 54mm ExpressCard slot for a wider assortment of expansion possibilities (most notably an ExpressCard wireless-broadband card to augment the machines standard 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi). But the real surprise is under the lid: a roomy keyboard (for a netbook) with a perfect layout. The square, flat-top keys are just 8 percent smaller than those on a full-size notebook keyboard. More important, ancillary keys are in the expected places, and the right Enter and Shift keys seem positively huge by netbook standards, making the Mini 2140 a comfortable fit for touch typists and those with larger hands. The keys also have HPs DuraKey coating, which the company claims makes them less prone to wear. The small 2.5x1.3-inch touch pad is typical for netbooks, though not as roomy or comfortable as the larger gesture-enabled pad found on the Eee PC 1002HA.      We have mixed feelings about the Mini 2140s 10.1-inch display. The 16:9 aspect ratio gives the panel a resolution of 1,024x576just shy of the 1,024x600 resolution of the Eee PC 1002HA and Samsung NC10. We think those extra pixels would make a difference. When rendering smaller type, like the words in Windows dialog boxes or the application names in its All Programs list, the panel cannot produce fully black text. Instead, the letters have a bluish halo effect and seem less distinct and a bit hard to read. This isn't a deal breaker, but it is noticeable, especially when you view the same menus side by side with the machine's Asus and Samsung competitors.       Otherwise, the LED-backlit screen is fine, producing rich colors and very good video reproduction. The Mini 2140s audio system is also pretty good. As is typical of both budget and ultraportable machines, the speakers could use more bass and sound a bit tinny. But theres plenty of volume, and the Mini 2140 sounds much less like a transistor radio than other budget machines weve tested.      As for other features, HP includes a 160GB, 5,400rpm drive standard. A 160GB, 7,200rpm model is also available, and under Windows both drives come with HPs 3D DriveGuard, an active-protection system that features an accelerometer that senses whether the machine is falling or jostling and signals the drive to park the heads to prevent head-to-platter impact (and possible data loss or head damage). Its a feature we feel should be standard on all netbooks, since these on-the-go companions will likely see rougher handling than their desktop-replacement cousins. HP will also offer a crashproof 80GB solid-state drive (SSD) as an option; pricing is not yet set, but its likely to double the cost of the machine. The Mini 2140s performance is right in line with that of other Intel Atom N270 machines weve tested recently. Futuremark PCMark05 failed to return a result (a problem weve had with other Atom netbooks), but the machines score of 133 on Cinebench 9.5 and 815 on Cinebench 10 are average for Windows XP-based netbooks. The Mini 2140 needed 27 minutes and 11 seconds to complete our Windows Media Encoder 9 test and 22 minutes and 35 seconds for our iTunes test. Those results are in line with others in its class, but as weve said before, theyre glacially slow compared with even bargain-basement traditional notebooks. The machine could not complete the Futuremark 3DMark06 graphics benchmark, but given the double-digit scores weve seen from other netbooks that use the same Intel 945 chipset integrated graphics, we doubt we missed much. The included three-cell battery delivered 2 hours and 13 minutes of runtime on our video-loop test, which is below average compared with other netbooks weve tested (some of which, admittedly, came with extended batteries). HP also offers an optional six-cell power pack, effectively doubling the machines AC-free abilities. And speaking of options, HP also offers a USB-powered external optical drive that shares the Mini 2140's sleek look, as well as an optional Bluetooth mouse and Bluetooth headset. You can order the Mini 2140 with Windows XP (Pro or Home), FreeDOS, SuSe Linux, or even Vista Business or Home Basic (at which point you would want to upgrade the standard 1GB of RAM to the machines maximum of 2GB). In the burgeoning ranks of netbook portables, each seemingly more impressive than the last, the HP Mini 2140 manages to stand out. It has a winning design and feature set, yet it doesnt command a price premium.

The type and style of keyboard that you may wish to purchase depends greatly on the user of the computer and the tasks they are doing with their systems. You can purchase a keyboard that features buttons specific to office applications, image manipulation, media centered of even gaming specific, but not all keyboards are the same.    One problem I've found with keyboards is that they are not all created equal, and personally I've gone through several keyboards to find one that I am comfortable with. There are many manufacturers of keyboards out there today, and generally I've found that it's worth spending the extra money for a quality keyboard instead of purchasing a lesser known brand.    If your occupation consists mainly of using a computer for long periods of time and specifically using a keyboard, using one that is not right for you can make the experience not a good one overall. Using the wrong keyboard can lead to lowered productivity, and possibly even bodily injuries that could require surgery to fix i.e. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or Repetitive Stress Injury.    Types of  Keyboards:    There are many types of keyboards on the market today, what type is right for you will depend on what it is you mainly do with your computer. You can find keyboards today with upwards of 130 keys on them depending on the style of type of keyboard you select, gone are the days of the standard 101 key keyboard.    Standard Keyboards  are just the basic no frills keyboard, there are no special buttons just commonly used keys, numbers and function keys, most people are familiar with these.    Specialty Keyboards  are manufactured and targeted to specialized applications such as graphic designers, computer aided drafting, audio and video editing, and word processing. These keyboards usually have color coded keys or have keys that are labeled with shortcuts that are specific to the applications being used. These keyboards are made specifically for these types of applications and help increase productivity along with making things a bit easier. These types of keyboards can be very expensive costing upwards of thousands of dollars sometimes.    Multimedia Keyboards  are becoming very popular since we now use our computers for more and more media related things like music, movies and TV. These types of keyboard usually include additional buttons either on the side or on the top of keyboard to launch and control these media applications, some even include a volume control knob as well. Wireless versions of multimedia keyboards are available to be used with HTPC systems so you can type and control your system from the comfort of your couch. Some of these styles even include a built-in trackball or touch pad to eliminate the need for a mouse.    Gaming Keyboards  are also a very popular keyboard segment, there are companies that just specifically create keyboards just for gaming. These types can be just a simple keyboard with improved quality components such as gold contacts to improve the reaction time and life of the keyboard. There are specialized gaming keyboards as well that look nothing like a standard keyboard where you can get overlays for certain popular games on the market today, these styles have keys that are color coded, shaped differently and just look nothing like a keyboard at all. Gaming Keyboards have the ability to  be used as a specialized keyboard as well since they are usually programmable, you can program them to your own specific application needs with shortcuts or key combinations.    Novelty Keyboards  are those types that really don't fit into any other category, you can find keyboards out there today that will fit in the palm of your hand, that you can roll up to carry with you, those that are water proof and even transparent keyboards with lights to add  a bit of color or style to you desktop. There are many types of oddball keyboards out there today, and honestly they aren't very useful for any kind of productivity, they are more for looks or just to be different. While some of these types of keyboards are actually meant to be useful in the end they fail as most are useless really.    Wireless Keyboards  have become very popular and you can find any style or type of keyboard in a  wireless version. These types have become more common with the growing popularity of home theater PCs, and of course our need to be free of wires and the clutter that comes with them. Primarily there are three types of wireless keyboards, infrared, RF (radio frequency) and bluetooth. Bluetooth and RF are the better of the three because infrared requires line-of-sight to be used, meaning that the transmitter and receiver need to see each other to be able to communicate between the two devices.     Note about Wireless Keyboards:   RF does have the drawback of possibly being hacked and allowing someone to eavesdrop on what you are typing, recording your keystrokes and potentially gaining access to your personal data or information. When choosing a wireless keyboard of this type make sure there is some sort of encryption built into the devices, this is usually standard on higher end keyboards, but it is becoming more common place on all wireless keyboards as security is a universal concern.    Alternatives:    The QWERTY keyboard layout has been around since the 1860's, starting in the form of a typewriter, but there are other options available, but just not as common place.    The Dvorak keyboard layout is actually the second most common keyboard layout available today, it was patented in 1936 by Dr. August Dvorak as an attempt to create a better keyboard by addressing problems of fatigue and inefficiency, but the QWERTY style layout is so ingrained into world culture that it has had a hard time gaining a foothold. The main reason for the Dvorak keyboard not being used is that not many people know about it, and those that do are just are not willing to re-learn how to type.    The Grid Layout is another alternative style layout, it uses the basic QWERTY layout but the keys are aligned in a grid and not offset as on a standard keyboard. This style of layout is supposed to be more ergonomic, help prevent typing related injuries and actually help or reduce existing symptoms from said injuries.    Others have tried to re-invent the keyboard but have not had luck with it, you can find many, types of keyboards on the market today besides the standard QWERTY layout.    Closing Thoughts:    There are many styles and types of keyboards on the market today, in the end you'll need to determine what best suits your needs and quite possibly you'll have to purchase several until you find the one that is right for you. My advice would have to be research them through product reviews and recommendations, don't just buy a keyboard because it looks good, if possible test a keyboard before buying it, some brick and mortar stores have keyboard on display that allow people to type on them or even test them with a computer before purchasing, at least this way you'll have some idea of what you are buying.     Most people take keyboards for granted as just something that is there, something that we type on and never really give it a second thought, but having the right keyboard can make your computing experience much more enjoyable, increase your productivity and even fun.     It took me quite a while to find one that I'm happy and comfortable with using all the time. So do yourself a favor and don't just buy any old keyboard, do some research and take the time to decide what is right for you personally, you'll be thankful that you did.

We just wish Microsoft would give more thought to the design and overall feel of its hardware.

If you typically find keyboard hot keys a good idea that's poorly implemented, we think you'll like this mostly well-designed mouse and keyboard set.

The back provides a list of features/specifications.  One thing that I immediately noticed was how slim the box was.                  Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    Opening the box, we find the keyboard loosely secured with a simple plastic bag covering the keyboard.  Along with the keyboard itself, the package comes with a CD of software.            Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures               Taking a closer look at the keyboard, the first thing I noticed was the nice matte black finish of the keyboard.  The keyboard is very light and has a compact form factor, much smaller than my Logitech revolution or Microsoft desktop keyboards.  The keyboard comes with a generous cord, almost 7 feet in length.

Editor: Amber Lupala      Ace KUC500 Slick Touch Keyboard Review  Today we are taking a look at another Ace product, this time we got a keyboard on the test bench. Will this work well together with the Ace mouse we reviewed a few days ago? How will this keyboard work vs Logitech and Microsoft keyboards that have been dominating the market for a longer period? Let's have a closer look to see what we can come up with.         About Ace:  Ace launched its first line of cases and power supplies spring 2006, since then, we have become a well knowned and popular brand on the market. Our focus is to offer our market products that fit the need of an everyday user, without high price but with good quality. In 2008, Ace will launch its 3rd generation of products, feel free to browse our homepage to find out more about these.                Specifications:  USB connection  Slim keyboard design  Flat keys  Multimedia buttons  Built in USB-hub, 2 ports  Fullsize     The product:            Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    The keyboard comes packed in a similar box to the mouse with the same color scheme and a big picture of the device itself on the box. Now I have to point out straight away that this is one of the slimmest keyboards I have ever seen. If you are in the market for something slim and sleek looking for your setup this might be a good choice whatever our conclusion is.    The right picture will show you a closer look on the keyboard itself, you got media buttons on the top to make usage and the the keyboard itself is made in a glossy piano black color to match the mouse that they also released recently.                  Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    The media buttons on the top of the keyboard will make it easier for you to listen to music and surf the net. The media buttons are divided to three sections where the left and right sections are meant for surfing the net and the middle part handles music and volume controls. We can for example see that on the left section you will be able to go back and forward in your browser or list up your favorites.   The middle section as said before is for music or sounds in general, you will be able to go through the songs control the volume in variosu ways or just mute the volume if you so decide.                    Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    I think I almost mentioned everything about the middle section so lets focus on the right picture which is the right section of the media buttons. Here you have a quick button to search, home, e-mail and even the sleep button. Now I wish the sleep button was protected or lower than the other buttons so you won't accidentely hit it.             Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    The keyboard feels nice to type on and the keys are easy to push down, although when pushing the buttons in the middle of the keyboard it gives in a bit and gets pushed down a few millimeters. I think they would have been better of reinforcing the middle part of the keyboard. Both of the sides have one USB plugin each and that is why this unit has two USB cable that you need to plug in. The keyboard works of course without the USB ports being connected but I find them to be very useful.             Please click on thumbnails to get bigger pictures    The keyboard has two legs that can be flipped up to change the angle that the keyboard will lay in. They feel like they can whitstand quite a bit of beating. Something very nice with this keyboard is that it has two extra keys for a norwegian or danish setup so they can get all their keys even on the keyboard and not only in windows.     Conclusion:  This keyboard works great overall, but there is usually at least one 'but' though and with this keyboard it is that when you push the keys in the middle it actually pushes down the whole keyboard a few millimeters. Compared to Logitech or Microsoft lower end keyboards do not do this, and when you type for a longer period of time they feel a bit more comfortable as the keyboard don't flex. I like the idea of the two USB plugins on the sides and the keyboard looks very nice with the glossy black finish. The keys are nice to type on but they dont make a bit of noise which I know alot of readers have asked about in earlier keyboard reviews. Overall though I dont think this keyboard will cost more than around 20$ which is what most users can afford so I am sure this will sell quite a bit due to the nice and slick design.      Pros:  + Good looking  + Well priced  + USB ports  + Slim    Cons:  - Middle of the keyboard       Current Real Time Pricing                Related Articles:    Ace Mouse MLUC100 Laser 1600D Review    NZXT Avatar Gaming Mouse Review    Logitech Cordless Desktop Wave Keyboard and Mouse Combo                                                                                               Gameboy SP                        Nintendo Wii                     Gameboy DS Lite                       Playstation 3                             Playstation 2                         PSP                        Xbox                     Xbox 360                           Processors                                PC Cases                            RAM Memory                            Free Cell Phones                              Digital Camera                             Flash Memory                            Laptop Computers                         LCD Monitors                              Hard Drives                                Motherboards                         MP3 Players                            Plasma TVs                              Video Cards                             Desktop Computers                         Handheld Devices                            DVD Players                              Camcorders                                Printers                            Wireless Networking                            Computer Speakers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Copyright 2002-2008 Rbmods.com.

Who saw that one coming?   It might look fairly basic, but it's actually a fully fledged computer. Inside, it's packing an Intel Atom N270 CPU running at 1.6GHz, 1GB of RAM, a choice of 16GB or 32GB of solid-state storage, and a 5-inch touch-sensitive display sitting to the far right-hand side.   The idea is that you connect the Eee Keyboard to an external display such as your TV via HDMI, or wirelessly via the integrated ultra-wideband HDMI. This effectively turns your telly into an Internet-capable Media Center-type machine, and a pretty versatile, compact one at that.    The 5-inch gesture-responsive touchscreen can be used for all manner of tasks. It serves as a mouse trackpad and the gateway to a bevy of widget-style applications that let you access media files, adjust volume and playback, and view images and videos, all using gestures. Think  iPhone  minus the multi-touch and you're on the right lines.   The rest of the design is also pretty clever. All the keys are backlit, it has two USB ports, 802.b/g/n Wi-Fi, a memory card reader, plus Ethernet and VGA ports. The fact it looks very much like an  iMac  or  MacBook  keyboard doesn't hurt, either.   We've no word on pricing or availability, since it's still in the concept stage, but we can imagine there being a big demand for a product of this type.

Saitek Eclipse Illuminated Keyboard Review                    November 23rd 2005  |       Peripherals                                 The Saitek Eclipse Illuminated Keyboard is branded a gaming keyboard, but it will appeal to almost anyone. Saitek has come out with a truly great and original product.    Overall I am really impressed with the Saitek Eclipse. It gives you a different feel than any other keyboards out there. The coolest part of the keyboard is its illumination. It will sure grab some attention at LAN parties. The keys feel great, and are positioned for gaming. There is no software or drivers to install, installation is quick and easy. The Eclipse has a clean sleek look that you will not find on a lot of keyboards. ThinkComputers gives the Saitek Eclipse Illuminated Keyboard a perfect 10 out of 10, and our Editors Choice Award!

It is set up in the same format as a typewriter.  Keys on the keyboard can be used to give the computer commands or to produce letters, numbers or symbols.  Computer keyboards may be connected to a computer through either a PS2 connection or  USB .  Wireless computer keyboards give the user flexibility to move around without having to mess with wires connected to the computer.  Generally these types of keyboards communicate with the computer via an IR receiver that is connected to the computer.         Fast Facts   2 basic types: QWERTY and DVORAK  QWERTY is most common type  Based on the typewriter  Inventor: Christopher Latham Sholes  Invented: 1863      Non-traditional Computer Keyboards   A number of non-traditional computer keyboards have been created.      With the higher usage of computers, a higher number of cases of repetitive stress injuries has greatly increased.  A common solution, which assists in keeping the users hands in a more natural position, is an ergonomic keyboard.  This type of keyboard looks much like a normal keyboard, but the key pad is split in the middle, leaving a large space between the two.    The roll-up keyboard has been created to allow users to take their keyboard with them.  It consists of a keyboard placed in a rubber material, allowing for it to bend easily.    A virtual laser keyboard is projected onto a tabletop, allowing the user to type on the virtual keyboard.  As the fingers pass through an inferred beam, the computer processes it as a normal keystroke.

Without a keyboard of some sort, there would be no Email, no Instant Messaging, no typing on the computer of Word Documents. One could say that besides the components inside a computer case, the keyboard along with the mouse is the most used computer hardware.         Keyboard      But I digress a little.

Today market has plenty of keyboards from different companies with different feels. Enermax is best known as a Power Supply company that also builds cases, and other computer peripherals.

Enhanced accuracy circuitry like WAAS and SBAS get mixed reviews for actual added accuracy however you can always turn them off.

This isn’t your fancy keyboard with macros or multimedia keys, but rather a keyboard that will be a near perfect atmosphere with quick keystrokes and limited disturbances for the hardcore gamer.   I am not a professional gamer, but I can see how this keyboard would help somebody who is. Even though I am not a pro gamer I did notice an improvement in my gaming. This may not be a big deal for me, but if you really are that avid gamer you will want something like this to help you with your game. For some, every little bit counts.    The hefty price tag of $129.00 will surely be worth it if you’re looking for a keyboard to improve your gaming. Even somebody who isn’t a gamer maybe someone who is a writer or even an average computer user would benefit from buying the SteelSeries Steelkeys 6G Professional Gaming Keyboard.

Read More                                                         Keyboard Buying Guide   The use of a computer can be broken down into two actions; input and output. We manipulate variables and objects and are presented with an output. Be it a document, website, computer game or anything else you can do on a computer, you are generally giving input and receiving some form of output. Two of the major ways we provide input to a computer are with the keyboard and the mouse  something standard on every home computer. Some people see a keyboard as nothing more than the sole means of typing things into the computer where as others see it as a much more advanced form of input; something that requires more than just your basic alphabet and flat design. You can buy a new keyboard for a single digit price tag or you can spend upwards of a three digit price tag on one. So what's the difference?    One thing that's the same on all keyboards is the layout of the keys themselves. All keyboards have letters, numbers, F keys and the necessities like shift, alt, ctr, etc. etc. The design and placement of these keys is what manufacturers are getting creative with. In an attempt to provide better ergonomics than a flat keyboard, we're seeing not only the arc of these keys being played with but also the angle and key depth as well. Some keyboards are designed with a split down the middle and each half of the keyboard slightly angled back in an attempt to keep our hands in a more natural position. That's just one example though, I've seen nearly half a dozen unique attempts at ergonomics on the market and some are comfortable while others are not. You'll also want to keep and eye open for keyboards that no longer have a num-pad. Although it's something we've all grown up with on a computer, many manufacturers are choosing to remove this on certain models in an attempt to make smaller and lighter keyboards (handy for home theatre computers). In addition to the basic keys, extra function keys are standard on almost every new keyboard as well. These keys add features like media control, application launching/switching and programmable favorites keys. Most will have default actions to correspond with what they are labeled to do, but if you want you can usually change the actions of most of these keys with the included software.    The next major decision you'll have to make is what interface style you need and whether you want a wired or wireless keyboard. This is a good time to mention that a lot of keyboards are sold as what's called a desktop set which means you're getting not only a keyboard but a mouse as well. These will both be the same interface and both wired or both wireless. Unless you're buying for an older computer, you will probably want the avoid the PS/2 interface. Being as dated as it is, very few brand new computers and motherboards even have this interface anymore. Wired or wireless is really a personal choice for you since I can't say what you will personally prefer. Wireless technology has come a long way from what it used to be and wireless keyboards using AA batteries can now get over a year from a set of batteries and mice that use AA batteries can go as long as five to six months! For that reason wireless no longer needs to be a technology where you worry about constant and costly battery replacement. You can now see wireless as a means of reducing cable clutter and giving you a little more freedom.    For power users and enthusiasts there are a growing number of more expensive keyboards out there with many more advanced features to offer. My keyboard, Logitech's MX5500, has a small display screen that shows me either media info, room temperature, hot-key choices, key counter or how many unread emails I have. All of this is done in a low-power manner as to keep the keyboard still wireless running off 4-AA batteries! Gamers might be familiar with the forms of customizable keyboards starting to emerge. These will let you physically remove and re-arrange extra keys to further enhance your speed and key accessibility while gaming. Those in the professional video and audio editing fields will be familiar with keyboards being designed and printed that are specific to the applications they use. By printing not only the regular key design but also an alternate design that outlines all the software shortcuts, they help to reduce the time wasted by clicking through menus to accomplish a task.    For those who are used to a plain keyboard or the one that their pre-built system shipped with then it might be a bit of a dive to try something new and seemingly more advanced looking. I'll admit, remembering to use all the extra keys on keyboards these days does take some getting used to! The positive side is that once you get used to everything offered by your keyboard you can speed up productivity and greatly reduce the number of clicks used to access your applications. When it comes down to it, check out all the keyboard offerings at your local computer store then go from there and decide how much you're willing to pay for what you really need in a keyboard.

Then came the  TomTom One XL , which upped the screen size to 4.3"" and added Bluetooth. Now there's the  TomTom One XL-S , which adds text-to-speech technology (we assume that ""S"" in its name stands for ""speech"").

The  Mio DigiWalker C720t  also has a media player (music, photos, videos) and a 2-megapixel digital camera.

It's lightweight (just 5.6 ounces), waterproof, and sensitive enough to hold a GPS signal almost anywhere, including canyons and areas with heavy tree coverage. The device comes with a basemap of North America, and if you insert a MapSource card with detailed street maps into the microSD card slot, it will provide turn-by-turn directions to your destination. Prices start around $250.
