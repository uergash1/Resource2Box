Many of these people remember this time as one of the  highpoints of their lives—a time of pride and dedication that they look back on  fondly.    They don’t want to look back  on those years as the time when they were  exposed to asbestos , the time when  their health was irrevocably ruined and their futures destroyed. But for all  too many of them, that’s what happened.    For decades, asbestos was  considered a “miracle mineral.” It was strong, fireproof, an electrical  insulator, and resistant to acids and other chemicals (1). It could be woven  into fireproof cloth, molded into half-round pipe insulation, mixed into  concrete, and formed into heat-resistant gloves, aprons, and coveralls. These  products were widely used in heavy industries, including  shipyards ,  refineries ,  and s teel mills .    These products were also  used in the  armed forces . In the Army and Air Force, asbestos was used in brake  and clutch pads installed in everything from tanks to jeeps to aircraft.  Asbestos was part of the insulation in housing and other buildings on military  bases, electric wiring insulation aboard military planes, and fire retardant  materials used by military firefighters and gunners (2).    In the  Navy ,  Merchant  Marine , and  Coast Guard , it was even more widely used, mainly as thermal  insulation aboard ships. Asbestos was considered so vital to the nation’s  security that the Navy issued specifications in 1939 requiring its use in newly  constructed naval vessels. Almost 300 different asbestos-containing products  were used in shipbuilding during World War II alone (3).    Much shipboard work was done  below decks, in cramped and unventilated engine and boiler rooms (2). These  enclosed spaces trapped asbestos fibers so that they floated in the air like a  white fog (3). Sailors and shipyard workers breathed that fog as they fought  and maintained their ships. They worked without respirators because they knew  nothing of the dangers of inhaling  asbestos fibers .    Now, decades later, thousands  of those sailors and shipyard workers have developed  asbestos-related diseases .  Some of these sailors and workers continued to work in asbestos industries  after their military service, as insulators or pipefitters or other craftsmen.  Still knowing nothing of the dangers they faced, these workers breathed  millions of asbestos fibers every day. It’s no wonder that so many of them  developed  asbestosis ,  asbestos-related cancer , and  mesothelioma .    But even those who left the  industrial sector for different lines of work were not safe, because they took  the asbestos fibers they had already inhaled with them.  Former sailors  and  workers whose only asbestos exposure was during their military service or while  working in a  Navy shipyard  have nevertheless died from mesothelioma. Even a  former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, Jr., died of mesothelioma in  January of 2000, possibly from asbestos he inhaled aboard a Navy ship (3).    The Navy refuses to compile  statistics for how many sailors have died from asbestos-related diseases (3).  But data from other sources claims that as many as 26% of mesothelioma patients  are former sailors and shipyard workers. They account for 16% of   asbestos-related lung cancers  and 13% of serious respiratory diseases (4).    Industrial asbestos  insulators, who worked under similar conditions to sailors and shipyard  workers, are 344 times more likely than unexposed people to develop   mesothelioma . About 94% of these insulators are likely to develop either mesothelioma,  asbestos-related lung cancer, or asbestosis (3).    Many former sailors and  soldiers admit they feel betrayed by the armed forces and the government they  served. There is evidence that the Navy knew of the dangers of  asbestos exposure   as long ago as 1922, when it recommended respirators for anyone working with the  fibers. Navy corpsmen were instructed in the dangers of asbestos in the late 1930s.  In 1943, the Navy set minimum working standards for shipyard workers exposed to  asbestos, requiring respirators and ventilation of dusty areas, but did not  enforce them. Workplace standards for active-duty sailors were not set until  OSHA set them in 1971. And the  Navy banned asbestos  on all ships constructed  after 1973, but violated their own policy until 1979 (3).    Although veterans who were  exposed to asbestos during their military service cannot sue the federal  government, they can apply to the VA for service-related disability and  benefits. But this can be a lengthy and difficult procedure, because veterans  have to prove that the damage to their lungs happened during their service  time. It can be extremely hard to prove something that happened so many years  ago, and fewer than one-third of the veterans who apply to the VA for  disability payments actually receive them (5).    They can also file civil  suits against the  asbestos manufacturers . But many of these former industrial  giants have gone out of business or filed for bankruptcy protection against the  thousands of  asbestos-related lawsuits filed  against them across the country (3).

(July 2008)       An  American Civil War reenactment  is an effort to recreate the appearance of a particular  battle  or other event associated with the  American Civil War  by  hobbyists  known (in the  United States ) as  Civil War reenactors  or  Civil War recreationists . Although most common in the United States, there are also American Civil War reenactors in  Canada , [ 1 ]  the  United Kingdom , [ 2 ]  and  Germany .

Civil War  veterans  recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. [ 4 ]  The  Great Reunion of 1913 , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  Battle of Gettysburg , was attended by more than 50,000  Union  and  Confederate  veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including  Pickett's Charge . [ 5 ]   Modern reenacting is thought to have begun during the 1961-1965 Civil War centennial commemorations. [ 6 ]  Reenacting grew in popularity during the 1980's and 1990's, due in large part to the success of the 125th Anniversary reenactment near the original Manassas battlefield, which was attended by more than 6,000 reenactors. [ 7 ]  That year,  Time Magazine  estimated that there were more than 50,000 reenactors in the US. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Participation     See also:  List of historical reenactment groups            Reenactment at the  American Museum  in  Bath ,  England       American Civil War  reenactments have drawn a fairly sizable following of enthusiastic participants, young and old, willing to brave the elements and expend money and resources in their efforts to duplicate the events down to the smallest recorded detail. Participants may even attend classes put on by event sponsors where they learn how to dress, cook, eat, and even ""die"" just as real Civil War soldiers would have. Most reenactments have anywhere from 100 to 1,000 participants, portraying either Union or Confederate infantry, artillery, or cavalry forces. Some people, though uncommon, may portray Engineers or Marines. The 135th anniversary Gettysburg reenactment (1998) is generally believed to be the most-attended reenactment, with attendance estimates ranging from 15,000 [ 9 ]  to over 20,000 reenactors. [ 10 ]   Reasons given for participating in such activities vary. Some participants are interested in getting a  historical  perspective on the turbulent times that gripped the nation, particularly if they can trace their ancestry back to those who fought in the war. In some cases, if there are not enough Union soldiers present, Confederate soldiers are asked to change sides, or become  galvanized yankees , for the day/event. [ 11 ]   Although many periods are reenacted around the world, Civil War reenactment is, by far, the most popular activity in the US, [ 12 ]  with an estimated 50,000 Civil War reenactors as of 2000. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Categories of Reenactors   Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for  authenticity . [ 12 ] [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Farbs          An  American Civil War  reenactor talks about life in a typical army field camp. Hard-core reenactors would consider him ""farby"" because of his weight, as well as the modern cigarette he is holding.       Some, called "" Farbs "" or ""polyester soldiers"" [ 15 ]  are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. The 'Good Enough' attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. Blue jeans, tennis shoes, polyester (and other man-made fabrics), zippers,  velcro ,  snoods , and modern cigarettes are common issues.   The origin of the word ""farb"" (and the derivative adjective ""farby"") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961. [ 16 ]  Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of ""Far be it from authentic."" [ citation needed ]  An alternative definition is ""Far Be it for me to question/criticise"", [ 17 ] [ 18 ]  or ""Fast And Researchless Buying"". [ 19 ] Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German  farbe , color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined, [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  or the German  farbische , manufactured, indicating obviously modern items. [ 22 ]  According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of ""The Black Hats, CSA"" reeanctment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Mainstream          A mainstream Federal  artillery  reenactor.       Another group of reenactors often is called ""Mainstream."" These reenactors are somewhere between  farb  and authentic. They are more common than either  farbs  or authentics. [ citation needed ]   Most mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the early 1860s, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used ""after hours"" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Progressive   At the other extreme from farbs are ""hard-core authentics"" or ""progressives,"" as they prefer to be called. [ 24 ]  Sometimes derisively called ""stitch counters"", [ 25 ]  many people have misconceptions about hardcore reenactors, [ 26 ]  which spawn from a published book about hardcore reenactors,  Confederates in the Attic . [ citation needed ]  Hard-cores generally seek an ""immersive"" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the 1860s might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event. [ 27 ]   Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate ""reenactorisms"", such as buttoning only the top button of a uniform jacket/coat, or insisting that a vest, jacket, or coat must be worn over a shirt at all times. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Types of Civil War reenactments     See also:  List of historical reenactment events     There are five loose categories of Civil War reenactments. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Total immersion events (Events By Us For Us, or EBUFU)   Total immersion events are made up solely of authentic reenactors, who march, live, eat and act like actual soldiers of the Civil War. These events are usually not public, meaning that the public cannot come and watch (it is for the reenactors amusement only).     [ edit ]   Living histories   Living histories are meant entirely for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of the average Civil War soldier. This does include civilian reenacting, a growing trend. Occasionally, a spy trial is recreated,and a medic too. More common are weapons and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. These should not, however, be confused with  Living history museums . These outlets for living history utilize museum professionals and trained interpreters in order to convey the most accurate information available to historians.   Living history is the only reenactment permitted on National Park Service land; NPS policy ""does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.""  [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Public demonstrations          Public demonstration in a parade for the sesquicentennial of  Red Wing, Minnesota .       Public demonstrations are smaller mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public how people in the 1860s lived, and to show the public civil war battles. The battles are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.     [ edit ]   Tactical battles       Main article:  Tactical event       Tactical battles, which are not usually open to the public, [ 29 ]  are fought like real battles with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). They have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees, [ 30 ]  and so could be considered a form of  live action role-playing game . Tactical battles might also be considered a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Time Bandits   ""Time bandit"" is a term to describe a historian who uses reenactment as part of their research. Often, this type of work is not seen at public events, so much as it is seen at museums, at special encampments, or in special circumstances. [ 32 ]  Examples might be using a reproduction of a stone age axe to chop down trees to measure the effectiveness of the tools. Or it can be the re-building of a kiln and using it to see first hand how the work was carried out. Alternately, it can be reenacting the use of cave dirt to manufacture potassium nitrate to imitate the work done in 1861, to measure the productivity of the Confederate chemists and the economy of using slave labor versus child labor for this work. [ 33 ]  Time bandits are also used as a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Scripted battles   Scripted battles are reenactment in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that the were taken in the original battles. They are often fought at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original.     [ edit ]   Reenactment and media   Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like  Gettysburg  and  Glory  benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics. [ 35 ]   In a documentary about the making of the film  Gettysburg , actor  Sam Elliott , who portrayed Union General  John Buford  in the film, said of reenactors:          I think we're really fortunate to have those people involved. In fact, they couldn't be making this picture without them; there's no question about that. These guys come with their wardrobe, they come with their weaponry. They come with all the accoutrements, but they also come with the stuff in their head and the stuff in their heart.          [ 36 ]   At times, however, the relationship between reenactors and filmmakers has been contentious. Although reenactors for  Gettysburg  were unpaid, money was contributed on their behalf to a trust for historic preservation; however, some subsequent productions have offered no such compensation. Also, in some cases reenactors have clashed with directors over one-sided portrayals and historical inaccuracies. [ 37 ]  Some producers have been less interested in accuracy than in the sheer number of reenactors, which can result in safety issues. Finally, large movie productions, like  Gettysburg , can draw enough reenactors to cause the cancellation of other events.

Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides. Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the  Union Army 's repulse of two  Confederate  attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the  Battle of Fredericksburg , and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of  Middle Tennessee .

Braxton Bragg 's  Army of Mississippi  was defeated at the  Battle of Perryville  on October 8, 1862, he retreated to  Harrodsburg, Kentucky , where he was joined by  Maj. Gen.   Kirby Smith 's army of 10,000 on October 10. Although Bragg's force was up to 38,000 veteran troops, he made no effort to regain the initiative.  Maj. Gen.   Don Carlos Buell , the Union victor at Perryville, was equally passive and refused to attack Bragg.   Frustrated, Bragg withdrew through the  Cumberland Gap , passed through  Knoxville  and  Chattanooga , turned northwest, and eventually stopped in  Murfreesboro, Tennessee . His army, joined with Smith's  Army of Kentucky  and together renamed the  Army of Tennessee  as of November 20, took up a defensive position northwest of the city along the West Fork of the  Stones River . During a visit by  Confederate President   Jefferson Davis  on December 16, Bragg was ordered to send the infantry division of Maj. Gen.  Carter L. Stevenson  to  Mississippi  to assist in the defense of  Vicksburg . The loss of Stevenson's 7,500 men would be sorely felt in the coming battle. Bragg reorganized his army, and Kirby Smith left for  East Tennessee . Bragg commanded two corps, under Maj. Gens.  William J. Hardee  and  Leonidas Polk , and a cavalry command under  Brig. Gen.   Joseph Wheeler . Considerable cavalry manpower and expertise were diluted from the young Wheeler's command when both  Nathan Bedford Forrest  and  John Hunt Morgan  were detached for strategic raids outside Middle Tennessee. Bragg had another disadvantage to deal witha virtual revolt of his senior generals, who petitioned Jefferson Davis to relieve him (in favor of Gen.  Joseph E. Johnston , the commander of all armies in the Western Theater). Davis refused to relieve either Bragg or the rebellious generals.   On the Union side,  President   Abraham Lincoln  had become frustrated with Buell's passivity and replaced him with Maj. Gen.  William S. Rosecrans , victor of the recent battles of  Iuka  and  Corinth . Rosecrans moved his  XIV Corps  (which was soon after designated the  Army of the Cumberland ) to  Nashville, Tennessee , and was warned by  Washington  that he too would be replaced if he did not move aggressively against Bragg and occupy eastern Tennessee. However, Rosecrans took ample time to reorganize and train his forces (particularly his cavalry) and resupply his army. He did not begin his march in pursuit of Bragg until December 26.   While Rosecrans was preparing in Nashville, Bragg ordered  Col.   John Hunt Morgan  to move north with his cavalry and operate along Rosecrans's lines of communications, to prevent him from foraging for supplies north of Nashville. The  Battle of Hartsville , at a crossing point on the  Cumberland River  about 40 miles (64 km) upstream from Nashville (north of Murfreesboro) was an incident in Morgan's raid to the north, before Rosecrans had the bulk of his infantry forces on the move. The relatively small battle that followed Morgan's surprise attack was an embarrassing Union defeat, resulting in many captured Union supplies and soldiers. The Union also engaged in a strategic cavalry raid. On December 26, the day Rosecrans marched from Nashville, a small force under Brig. Gen.  Samuel P. Carter  raided the upper Tennessee Valley from  Manchester, Kentucky . Until January 5, Carter's men destroyed railroad bridges and fought a few skirmishes, including a serious one on December 28 at Perkins's Mill (also known as Elk Fort). But none of the cavalry raids, Confederate or Union, had any significant effect on the Stones River Campaign.   The Army of the Cumberland marched southeast the day after  Christmas  in three columns, or ""wings"", towards Murfreesboro, and they were effectively harassed by Wheeler's Confederate cavalry along the way, which delayed their movements. Although Rosecrans had reported his army to have 81,729 effectives in Nashville, his force on the march was barely more than half of that since he needed to protect his base and supply lines from the harassment of the Confederate cavalry. The left wing under Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden  (14,500 men) took a route that was parallel to the  Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad , passing through  La Vergne  and south of  Smyrna . The center wing of 16,000 men under Maj. Gen.  Alexander McCook  marched south along the Nolensville Turnpike to  Nolensville , south to  Triune , and then eastward to Murfreesboro. The right wing of 13,500 men under Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas  moved south along the Wilson Turnpike and the Franklin Turnpike, parallel to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, then eastward through Nolensville and along the same route used by Crittenden south of the Nashville and Chattanooga. The separation of the wings was designed to launch a turning movement against Hardee at Triune, but when the Federal march began, Bragg moved Hardee back to Murfreesboro to avoid a confrontation.     [ edit ]   Murfreesboro and plans for battle          Limestone outcroppings in a cedar forest at Stones River National Battlefield, 2005       Murfreesboro was a small town in the Stones River Valley, a former state capital named for a  colonel  in the  American Revolutionary War ,  Hardy Murfree . All through the war it was a center for strong Confederate sentiment, and Bragg and his men were warmly welcomed and entertained during the month of December. It was located in a rich agricultural region from which Bragg planned to provision his army and a position that he intended to use to block a potential Federal advance on Chattanooga. Hardee noted afterwards that ""The field of battle offered no particular advantages for defense."" Despite this, Bragg was reluctant to move farther south, say to the arguably more defensible  Duck River  Valley, or farther north, to Stewart's Creek, where Rosecrans thought Bragg would defend. Sensitive to the political requirements that almost no Tennessee ground be yielded to Federal control, he chose the relatively flat area northwest of the politically influential city, straddling the Stones River. Portions of the area, particularly near the intersection of the Nashville Pike and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, were characterized by small but dense cedar forests, in places more impenetrable to infantry than the  Wilderness  of  Virginia . Short limestone outcroppings, separated by narrow cracks as if rows of teeth, impeded the movement of wagons and artillery. Hardee's Corps was initially placed in Triune, about 20 miles (32 km) to the west, Polk's on the west bank of the river, and a detached division from Hardee's Corps under Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge  on the low hills east of the river. None of the troops were ordered to construct field fortifications.   By the time Rosecrans had arrived in Murfreesboro on the evening of December 29, the Army of Tennessee had been encamped in the area for a month. By nightfall, two thirds of Rosecrans's army was in position along the Nashville Turnpike, and by the next day Rosecrans's army numbered about 45,000 and Bragg's 38,000. The odds were closer than those figures would indicate. Bragg had the advantage of the detached, but cooperating, cavalry commands under Forrest and Morgan, who raided deeply behind Union lines while Wheeler's cavalry slowed the Union forces with hit-and-run skirmishes. (Part of Rosecrans's reluctance to move from Nashville was the inexperience of his cavalry forces in comparison to their Confederate counterparts.) On December 29, Wheeler and 2,500 of his men rode completely around the Union army, destroying supply wagons and capturing reserve ammunition in Rosecrans's trains. They captured four wagon trains and 1,000 Union prisoners.   On December 30, the Union force moved into line two miles (3 km) northwest of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about 4 miles (6 km) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg's left  flank  was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked there when he arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, but he did not know the full disposition of Bragg's forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year's  First Battle of Bull Run , both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy's right, get into his rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.          Movements and positions the night of December 30 to December 31.       Bragg's forces were situated with  Leonidas Polk 's corps on the west side of the river,  William J. Hardee 's men on the east. He had expected Rosecrans to attack on December 30, but when that attack did not come, his plan was to drive Hardee's corps and the cavalry under Brig. Gen.  John A. Wharton  deep into the Union rear. He began moving the bulk of Hardee's corps across the river to his left flank in preparation for the next morning's attack. This left Breckinridge's division in reserve on the east side of the river on the high ground.   Rosecrans planned to have Crittenden cross the river and attack the heights east of the river, which would be an excellent artillery platform from which to bombard the entire Confederate line. Crittendenfacing Breckinridge on the Union leftfailed to notify McCook (on the Union right) of these troop movements. McCook, anticipating that the next day would start with a major attack by Crittenden, planted numerous campfires in his area, hoping to deceive the Confederates as to his strength on that flank, and to disguise the fact that his flank was not anchored on an obstacle (the nearby Overall Creek). Thomas, in the center, was ordered to make a limited attack and act as the pivot for Crittenden's wheel.   The armies bivouacked only 700 yards (640 m) from each other, and their bands started a musical battle that became a non-lethal preview of the next day's events. Northern musicians played  Yankee Doodle  and  Hail, Columbia  and they were answered by  Dixie  and  The Bonnie Blue Flag . Finally, one band started playing  Home Sweet Home  and the others joined in. Thousands of Northern and Southern soldiers sang the sentimental song together across the lines.     [ edit ]   December 31          December 31, 8:00 a.m.       At dawn on December 31, about 6 a.m., Confederate  William J. Hardee  struck first, attacking the Union's right flank with the division of Maj. Gen.  John P. McCown , before many in Union Brig. Gen.  Richard W. Johnson 's division had finished their breakfast. (This was the third major battle, after  Fort Donelson  and  Shiloh , in which an early morning attack caught a Union army by surprise.) The 10,000 Confederates who massed on their left attacked in one massive wave. McCook's deceptive campfires and the relative inexperience of McCown caused his division drift away to the left, which left a gap in the front, but the gap was filled seamlessly by the division coming up from his rear, under Maj. Gen.  Patrick R. Cleburne . These two divisions swept all resistance aside. Several  artillery batteries  were captured without having time to fire a shot. Johnson's division, on the right, suffered over 50% casualties. His neighboring Union division to the left, under Brig. Gen.  Jefferson C. Davis , was able to hold only briefly.   Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee drove the Union troops back three miles (5 km) to the railroad and the Nashville Pike by 10 a.m., where Johnson was able to rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden's attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with  Brig. Gen.   Horatio P. Van Cleve 's division crossing the river at 7 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had been slow to recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook would be capable of turning back Hardee's assault. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with blood from his friend and chief of staff, Col.  Julius Garesch , beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.          December 31, 9:45 a.m.       The second Confederate wave was by the Polk's corps, consisting the divisions of Maj. Gens.  Jones M. Withers  and  Benjamin F. Cheatham . What saved the Union from total destruction that morning was the foresight of Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan  (McCook's wing), who anticipated an early attack and had the troops of his division up and ready in the center of the right half of the line by 4 a.m. Withers hit Sheridan's right flank first (and Davis's left) but was repulsed in three separate charges. Then Cheatham, with his reserve division, hit Sheridan's front as Cleburne struck his flank. Cheatham's assault was sluggish and piecemeal; observers claimed he had been drinking heavily and was unable to command his units effectively. While Sheridan's men slowed the enemy advance, they did it at heavy cost to themselves; all three of Sheridan's brigade commanders were killed that day, and more than one third of his men were casualties in four hours of fighting in a cedar forest surrounded on three sides that became known as ""The Slaughter Pen"". By 10 a.m., many of the Confederate objectives had been achieved. They had captured 28 guns and over 3,000 Union soldiers.          December 31, 11:00 a.m.       Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on the east side of the river, did not realize that Crittenden's early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as reinforcements across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his frontso that  some  use could be made of his corpsBreckinridge moved forward and was embarrassed to find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike in his direction. He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.   By 11 a.m., Sheridan's ammunition ran low, and his division pulled back, which opened a gap that Hardee exploited. The Union troops regrouped and held the Nashville Pike, supported by reinforcements and massed  artillery . Repeated attacks on the left flank of the Union line were repulsed by Colonel  William B. Hazen 's  brigade  in a rocky, 4-acre (16,000 m 2 ) wooded area named ""Round Forest"" by the locals; it became known as ""Hell's Half-Acre"". Brig. Gen.  Milo S. Hascall  arrived in the Round Forest with reinforcements and decided the position must be held at all costs. [ 1 ]  Hazen's brigade, therefore, was the only part of the original Union line to hold. The Union line was stabilized by the strong leadership of Rosecrans and by the rallying of the divisions under Johnson and Davis. The new line was roughly perpendicular to the original line, in a small half oval with its back to the river.   Bragg planned to attack the Union left, a portion of the oval line facing southeast, manned by Hazen's brigade. The only troops available for such an assault were Breckinridge's, and Bragg ordered him to cross the river, but Breckinridge moved slowly. By 4 p.m., Breckinridge's first two brigades assaulted Hazen in piecemeal attacks and suffered heavy repulses. Two more brigades arrived, and they were sent in, reinforced by other elements of Polk's corps. The attack failed a second time. Thomas responded with a limited counterattack that cleared his front. By 4:30 p.m., the battle was finished.          December 31, 4:00 p.m.       Bragg's plan had had a fundamental flaw: although his objective was to cut Rosecrans's line of communication (the Nashville Pike), his attack drove the Union defenders to concentrate at that point. Bragg's biographer, Grady McWhiney, observed:       Unless the Union army collapsed at the first onslaught, it would be pushed back into a tighter and stronger defensive position as the battle continued, while the Confederate forces would gradually lose momentum, become disorganized, and grow weaker. Like a snowball, the Federals would pick up strength from the debris of battle if they retreated in good order. But the Confederates would inevitably unwind like a ball of string as they advanced.       That night Rosecrans held a  council of war  to decide what to do. Some of his generals felt that the Union army had been defeated and recommended a retreat before they were entirely cut off. Rosecrans opposed this view and was strongly supported by Thomas and Crittenden. Thomas has been quoted by different sources in the council meeting as saying either ""This army does not retreat"" or ""There's no better place to die."" The decision was made to stand and fight, and as the Union line was reinforced, the morale of the soldiers rose. Rosecrans was quoted after the battle as saying, ""Bragg's a good dog, but Hold Fast's a better.""   On the Confederate side, Bragg was certain that he had won a victory. Although he had suffered 9,000 casualties, he was convinced that the large number of captured Union soldiers meant that Rosecrans had lost considerably more. The Confederate army began digging in, facing the Union line. Bragg sent a telegram to  Richmond  before he went to bed: ""The enemy has yielded his strong position and is falling back. We occupy [the] whole field and shall follow him. ... God has granted us a happy New Year.""     [ edit ]   January 1 to January 3          January 2, 4:00 p.m.              January 2, 4:45 p.m.       At 3 a.m. on January 1, 1863, Rosecrans revived his original plan and ordered Van Cleve's division (commanded by Col. Samuel Beatty following Van Cleve's wounding the previous day) to cross the river and occupy the heights there, protecting two river crossing sites and providing a good platform for artillery. But the day was relatively quiet as both armies observed  New Year's Day  by resting and tending to their wounded. Polk launched two probes of the Union line, one against Thomas, the other against Sheridan, to little effect.   In the rear, Wheeler's cavalry continued to harass the Union line of communication on the turnpike back to Nashville. Convoys of wounded had to travel under heavy escort to be protected from the cavalry, and Wheeler interpreted these movements as preparations for a retreat, and he reported such to Bragg. Buoyed by his sense that he had won the battle, Bragg was content to wait for Rosecrans to retreat.   At 4 p.m. on January 2, Bragg directed Breckinridge's troops to attack Beatty's division, which was occupying the hill on the east side of the river. Breckinridge initially protested that the assault would be suicidal but eventually agreed and attacked with determination. The Union troops were pushed back across McFadden  Ford , but the Confederate charge ran into heavy fire from massed Union artillery across the river, commanded by Crittenden's artillery chief, Captain  John Mendenhall . Mendenhall deployed his guns perfectly45 arrayed hub-to-hub, completely commanding the opposite bank and heights beyondand saved the day for Rosecrans. The Confederate attack stalled, having suffered over 1,800 casualties in less than an hour. A Union division under the command of  James S. Negley  (Thomas's wing) led a counterattack at 4:45 p.m., and the Confederate troops retreated. Breckinridge was devastated by the disaster. He lost nearly one third of his Kentucky troops ( Hanson's  Brigade, also known as the  Orphan Brigade  because it could not return to Union-occupied Kentucky). As he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, ""My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans.""   On the morning of January 3, a large supply train and reinforced infantry brigade reached Rosecrans. Wheeler's cavalry attempted to capture the ammunition train that followed it but was repulsed. Late that evening, Thomas attacked the center of the Confederate line with two regiments in reaction to constant enemy sharpshooting against troops in his division under  Lovell H. Rousseau . Thomas drove the Confederates from their entrenchments, taking 70 to 80 prisoners. (Despite this action, the main battle is generally accepted to have ended on January 2.)   Bragg was convinced that Rosecrans would continue to receive reinforcements, and he knew that the miserable weather of freezing rain could raise the river enough to split his army. Beginning at 10 p.m. on January 3, he withdrew through Murfreesboro and began a retreat to  Tullahoma, Tennessee , 36 miles (58 km) to the south. Rosecrans occupied Murfreesboro but made no attempt to pursue Bragg.     [ edit ]   Aftermath   Total casualties in the battle were 23,515: 13,249 on the Union side and 10,266 for the Confederates. This was the highest percentage of casualties of any major battle in the Civil War, higher in absolute numbers than the famous bloodbaths at  Shiloh  and  Antietam  earlier that year. The battle was tactically inconclusive, although Bragg was traditionally considered to be defeated since he withdrew first from the battlefield. He received almost universal scorn from his Confederate military colleagues; only the support of  Joseph E. Johnston  and President  Jefferson Davis 's inability to find a suitable replacement saved his command. But a case can also be made that it was at least a strategic Union victory. The battle was very important to Union morale, as evidenced by  Abraham Lincoln 's letter to General Rosecrans: ""You gave us a hard-earned victory, which had there been a defeat instead, the nation could scarcely have lived over."" The Confederate threat to Middle Tennessee had been nullified.   Rosecrans spent five and a half months reinforcing Murfreesboro. The massive earthenworks ""Fort Rosecrans"" was built there and served as a supply depot for the remainder of the war. The next major clash, the  Battle of Hoover's Gap , also known as the Tullahoma Campaign, did not come until June, when Rosecrans finally moved his army against Bragg.   Part of the site of the Battle of Stones River and Fort Rosecrans is now  Stones River National Battlefield . It contains the nation's oldest intact Civil War monument, erected by William Hazen's brigade at Hell's Half Acre. The 600 acre (2.4 km) National Battlefield includes Stones River National Cemetery, established in 1865, with more than 6,000 Union graves.

The battle was the most significant Union defeat in the  Western Theater  of the  American Civil War .    After his successful  Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive, aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. The three corps comprising Rosecrans's army set out for Chattanooga by separate routes. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg's army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at  Davis's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans's army, defeat it, and then move back into the city. On September 17 he headed north, intending to attack the isolated  XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18, his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry, which were armed with  Spencer repeating rifles .   Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19, and Bragg's men strongly assaulted but did not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg continued his assault on the Union line, and in late morning, Rosecrans was informed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans created an actual gap, and Confederate  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet 's men promptly exploited it, driving one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field. Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  took over command and began consolidating forces on Horseshoe Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Although the Confederates launched determined assaults on Thomas and his men, they held until after dark. The Union retired to Chattanooga while the Confederates occupied the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

[ 5 ]  General-in-chief Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck  and  President   Abraham Lincoln  were insistent that Rosecrans move quickly to take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward  Atlanta  and the heartland of the  South . Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward  Nashville  and  Knoxville  and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between  Lookout Mountain ,  Missionary Ridge , Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer's Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position. [ 6 ]   Although Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee contained about 52,000 men at the end of July, the Confederate government merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner , into Bragg's Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg's army, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the  Knoxville  area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg's command who had little or no respect for the commanding general. [ 7 ]  Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  and Maj. Gen.  William J. Hardee  had already made their animosity well known. Buckner's attitude was colored by Bragg's unsuccessful invasion of Buckner's native Kentucky in 1862, as well as by the loss of his command through the merger. [ 8 ]  A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee's request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill , a general who did not get along with  Robert E. Lee  in Virginia. [ 9 ]  The Confederate War Department asked Bragg in early August if he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements for Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. [ 10 ]  He was also concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen.  Ambrose E. Burnside  that was threatening Knoxville. Bragg withdrew his forces from advanced positions around  Bridgeport , which left Rosecrans free to maneuver on the northern side of the Tennessee River. He concentrated his two infantry corps around Chattanooga and relied upon cavalry to cover his flanks, extending from northern  Alabama  to near Knoxville. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   River of Death   The campaign and major battle take their name from West Chickamauga Creek. In popular histories, it is often said that Chickamauga is a  Cherokee  word meaning ""river of death"". [ 12 ]  Peter Cozzens, who has written arguably the most definitive book on the battle,  This Terrible Sound , wrote that this is the ""loose translation"". [ 13 ]  Glenn Tucker presents the translations of ""stagnant water"" (from the ""lower Cherokee tongue""), ""good country"" (from the  Chickasaw ) and, ""river of death"" (dialect of the ""upcountry Cherokee""). Tucker claims that the ""river of death"" came by its name not from early warfare, but from the location that the Cherokee contracted smallpox. [ 14 ]  James Mooney, in  Myths of the Cherokee , wrote that Chickamauga is the more common spelling for  Tskma'g , a name that has ""lost any meaning in Cherokee and appears to be of foreign origin."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Opposing forces     Further information:  Confederate order of battle , and  Union order of battle            Commanding generals Rosecrans and Bragg       The Union  Army of the Cumberland , commanded by Rosecrans, consisted of about 60,000 men, [ 2 ]  composed of the following major organizations: [ 16 ]     XIV Corps , commanded by Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas , 22,781 present for duty with division commanders Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird , Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley , Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan , and Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds .

Van Cleve .   Reserve Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger , 7,372 present with one division commanded by Brig. Gen.  James B. Steedman  and an attached brigade of Col.  Daniel McCook .   Cavalry Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Robert B. Mitchell , [ 17 ]  10,078 present with division commanders Brig. Gen.  George Crook , and Col.  Edward M. McCook .     The Confederate  Army of Tennessee , commanded by Bragg, with about 65,000 men, [ 3 ]  was composed of the following major organizations: [ 18 ]     The Right Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham , Hill's Corps of Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Patrick R. Cleburne  and  John C. Breckinridge ) and the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  (divisions of Brig. Gen.  States Rights Gist  and  St. John R. Liddell ).   The Left Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman , Buckner's Corps of Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner  (divisions of Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart  and Brig. Gens.  William Preston  and  Bushrod R. Johnson ) and Longstreet's Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  John Bell Hood  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Lafayette McLaws  and Hood).   A cavalry corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Wheeler , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  John A. Wharton  and  William T. Martin .   A second cavalry corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  Frank C. Armstrong  and  John Pegram .     The organization of the Army of Tennessee into Wings was ordered the night of September 19 upon the arrival of Longstreet from Virginia. Prior to this, the corps commanders reported directly to Bragg. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign          Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign, August 15  September 8, 1863.        Confederate         Union         [ edit ]   Planning the Union advance   Rosecrans faced significant logistical challenges if he chose to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans would be forced to fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of ""recklessness, conceit and malice"" of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until the least August 17. [ 20 ]   Rosecrans knew that he would have difficulty receiving supplies from his base on any advance across the Tennessee River and therefore thought it necessary to accumulate enough supplies and transport wagons that he could cross long distances without a reliable line of communications. His subordinate generals were supportive of this line of reasoning and counseled delay, all except for Brig. Gen.  James A. Garfield , Rosecrans's chief of staff, a politician who understood the value of being on the record endorsing the Lincoln administration's priorities. [ 21 ]   The plan for the Union advance was to cross the Cumberland Plateau into the valley of the Tennessee River, pause briefly to accumulate some supplies, and then cross the river itself. An opposed crossing of the wide river was not feasible, so Rosecrans devised a deception to distract Bragg above Chattanooga while the army crossed downstream. Then the Army would advance on a wide front through the mountains. The  XXI Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden  would advance against the city from the west, the  XIV Corps  under Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  would cross over Lookout Mountain 20 miles south of the city, while the  XX Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Alexander M. McCook  and the Cavalry Corps under Maj. Gen.  David S. Stanley  would advance even farther to the southeast toward Bragg's railroad supply line leading from Atlanta. If executed correctly, this plan would cause Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga or be trapped in the city without supplies. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Crossing the Tennessee   Rosecrans ordered his army to move on August 16. The difficult road conditions meant a full week passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans's deception plan was underway.  Col.   John T. Wilder  of the  XIV Corps  moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at  Hoover's Gap ) to the north of Chattanooga. His men pounded on tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt.  Eli Lilly , bombarded the city from Stringer's Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the  Second Battle of Chattanooga . The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside's advancing  Army of the Ohio  from Knoxville. [ 23 ]   The first crossing of the Tennessee River was accomplished by the XX Corps at Caperton's Ferry, 4 miles from  Stevenson  on August 29, where construction began on a 1,250-foot pontoon bridge. The second crossing, of the XIV Corps, was at  Shellmound, Tennessee , on August 30. They were quickly followed by most of the XXI Corps. The fourth crossing site was at the mouth of  Battle Creek, Tennessee , where the rest of the XIV Corps crossed on August 31. Without permanent bridges, the Army of the Cumberland could not be supplied reliably, so another bridge was constructed at Bridgeport by Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan 's division, spanning 2,700 feet in three days. Virtually all of the Union army, other than elements of the Reserve Corps kept behind to guard the railroad, had safely crossed the river by September 4. They faced more mountainous terrain and road networks that were just as treacherous as the ones they had already traversed. [ 24 ]   The Confederate high command was concerned about this development and took steps to reinforce the Army of Tennessee. General  Joseph E. Johnston 's army dispatched on loan two weak divisions (about 9,000 men) from  Mississippi  under Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge  and Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  by September 4, and General  Robert E. Lee  dispatched a corps under  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet  from the  Army of Northern Virginia . Only two divisions of Virginians reached Bragg, of which only five brigades (about 5,000 effectives) arrived in time for the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Into Georgia   The three infantry corps of Rosecrans's army advanced by separate routes, on the only three roads that were suitable for such movements. On the right flank, McCook's XX Corps moved southwest to  Valley Head, Alabama ; in the center, Thomas's XIV Corps moved just across the border to  Trenton, Georgia ; and on the left, Crittenden's XXI Corps moved directly toward Chattanooga around Lookout Mountain. On September 8, after learning that Rosecrans had crossed into his rear, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga and moved his army south along the LaFayette Road toward  LaFayette, Georgia . The Union army occupied Chattanooga on September 9. Rosecrans telegraphed Halleck, ""Chattanooga is ours without a struggle and East Tennessee is free."" [ 26 ]  Bragg was aware of Rosecrans's dispositions and planned to defeat him by attacking his isolated corps individually. The corps were spread out over 40 miles (65 km), too far apart to support each other. [ 27 ]          Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863.       Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and fleeing to either  Dalton ,  Rome , or  Atlanta, Georgia . Instead, Bragg's Army of Tennessee was encamped at LaFayette, some 20 miles (32 km) south of Chattanooga. Confederate soldiers who posed as deserters deliberately added to this impression. Thomas firmly cautioned Rosecrans that a pursuit of Bragg was unwise because the Army of the Cumberland was too widely dispersed and its supply lines were tenuous. Rosecrans, exultant at his success in capturing Chattanooga, discounted Thomas's advice. He ordered McCook to swing across Lookout Mountain at Winston's Gap and use his cavalry to break Bragg's railroad supply line at  Resaca, Georgia . Crittenden was to take Chattanooga and then turn south in pursuit of Bragg. Thomas was to continue his advance toward LaFayette. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Davis's Cross Roads   Thomas's lead division, under Maj. Gen.  James Negley , intended to cross McLemore's Cove and use Dug Gap in Pigeon Mountain to reach LaFayette. Negley was 12 hours ahead of Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird 's division, the nearest reinforcements. Braxton Bragg hoped to trap Negley by attacking through the cove from the northeast, forcing the Union division to its destruction at the cul-de-sac at the southwest end of the valley. Early on the morning of September 10, Bragg ordered Polk's division under Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman  to march 13 miles southwest into the cove and strike Negley's flank. He also ordered D.H. Hill to send Cleburne's division from LaFayette through Dug Gap to strike Negley's front, making sure the movement was coordinated with Hindman's. [ 29 ]   Entering the cove with 4,600 men, Negley's division encountered Confederate skirmishers, but pressed forward to Davis's Cross Roads. Informed that there was a large Confederate force approaching on his left, Negley took up a position in the mouth of the cove and remained there until 3 a.m. on September 11. Hill claimed that Bragg's orders reached him very late and began offering excuses for why he could not advanceCleburne was sick in bed and the road through Dug Gap was obstructed by felled timber. He advised calling off the operation. Hindman, who had executed Bragg's orders promptly and had advanced to within 4 miles of Negley's division, became overly cautious when he realized that Hill would not be attacking on schedule and ordered his men to stop. Bragg reinforced Hindman with two divisions of Buckner's corps, which were encamped near Lee and Gordon's Mill. When Buckner reached Hindman at 5 p.m. on September 10, the Confederates outnumbered Negley's division 3 to 1, but failed to attack. [ 30 ]   Infuriated that his orders were being defied and a golden opportunity was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he heard the sound of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Final maneuvers          Lee and Gordon's Mills.       Realizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and, as he wrote in his official report""as a matter of life and death""began to concentrate his scattered forces. [ 32 ]  On September 12 he ordered McCook and the cavalry to move northeast to Stevens Gap to join with Thomas, intending for this combined force to continue northeast to link up with Crittenden. The message to McCook took a full day to reach him at Alpine and the route he selected to move northeast required three days of marching 57 miles, retracing his steps over Lookout Mountain. [ 33 ]   Crittenden's corps began moving from Ringgold toward Lee and Gordon's Mill. Forrest's cavalry reported the movement across the Confederate front and Bragg saw another offensive opportunity. He ordered Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  to attack Crittenden's lead division, under Brig. Gen.  Thomas J. Wood , at dawn on September 13, with Polk's corps and Walker's corps. Bragg rode to the scene after hearing no sound of battle and found that there were no preparations being made to attack. Once again, Bragg was angry that one of his subordinates did not attack as ordered, but by that morning it was too lateall of Crittenden's corps had passed by and concentrated at Lee and Gordon's Mill. [ 34 ]   For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. Bragg, learning of McCook's movement at Alpine, feared the Federals might be planning a double envelopment. At a council of war on September 15, Bragg's corps commanders agreed that an offensive in the direction of Chattanooga offered their best option. [ 35 ]   By September 17, McCook's corps had reached Stevens Gap and the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Yet Bragg decided that he still had an opportunity. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen.  Bushrod R. Johnson , he decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army out to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. The Confederate army was to move beyond the Federal left flank at Lee and Gordon's Mill and then cross West Chickamauga Creek. He specified four crossing points, from north to south: Johnson's division at Reed's Bridge, Walker's Reserve Corps at Alexander's Bridge, Buckner's corps at Thedford's Ford, and Polk's corps at Dalton's Ford. Hill's corps would anchor the army's left flank and the cavalry under Forrest and Wheeler would cover Bragg's right and left flanks, respectively. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Opening engagements: September 18          September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga.       Bushrod Johnson's division took the wrong road from Ringgold, but eventually headed west on the Reed's Bridge Road. At 7 a.m. his men encountered cavalry pickets from Col. Robert Minty's brigade, guarding the approach to Reed's Bridge. Being outnumbered five to one, Minty's men eventually withdrew across the bridge after being pressured by elements of Forrest's cavalry, but could not destroy the bridge in time to prevent Johnson's men from crossing. At 4:30 p.m., when Johnson had reached Jay's Mill, Maj. Gen.  John B. Hood  of Longstreet's Corps arrived from the railroad station at Catoosa and took command of the column. He ordered Johnson to use the Jay's Mill Road instead of the Brotherton Road, as Johnson had planned. [ 37 ]   At Alexander's Bridge to the south, Col.  John T. Wilder 's mounted infantry brigade defended the crossing against the approach of Walker's Corps. Armed with  Spencer repeating rifles  and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, Wilder was able to hold off a brigade of Brig. Gen.  St. John Liddell's  division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 4:30 p.m., considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew and establish a new blocking position east of the Lafayette Road, near the Viniard farm. [ 38 ]   By dark, Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. Buckner had been able to push only one brigade across the creek at Thedford's Ford. Polk's troops were facing Crittenden's at Lee and Gordon's Mill and D.H. Hill's corps guarded crossing sites to the south. [ 39 ]   Although Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area. [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Battle of Chickamauga     [ edit ]   September 19          Actions, morning of September 19.       Rosecrans's movement of Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas 's XIV Corps the previous day put the left flank of the Army of the Cumberland farther north than Bragg expected to find when he formulated his plans for an attack on September 20. Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden 's XXI Corps was concentrated around Lee and Gordon's Mill, which Bragg assumed was the left flank, but Thomas was arrayed behind him, covering a wide front from Crawfish Springs (division of Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley ), the Widow Glenn's house (Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds ), Kelly field (Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird ), to around the McDonald farm (Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan ). Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger 's Reserve Corps was spread along the northern end of the battlefield from Rossville to McAfee's Church. [ 41 ]   Bragg's plan was for an attack on the supposed Union left flank by the corps of Maj. Gens.  Simon B. Buckner ,  John Bell Hood , and  W.H.T. Walker , screened by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest 's cavalry to the north, with Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham 's division held in reserve in the center and Maj. Gen.  Patrick R. Cleburne 's division in reserve at Thedford's Ford. Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman 's division faced Crittenden at Lee and Gordon's Mill and Breckinridge's faced Negley. [ 42 ]   The Battle of Chickamauga opened almost by accident, when pickets from Col.  Daniel McCook 's brigade of Granger's Reserve Corps moved toward Jay's Mill In search of water. McCook had moved from Rossville on September 18 to aid Col. Robert Minty's brigade. His men established a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay's Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At about the time that McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed's Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest's Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook's men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville and his men were pursued by Davidson's troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped on the west side of Chickamauga Creek. Thomas ordered Brannan's division to attack and destroy it. [ 43 ]          Union troops advancing at Chickamauga, drawing by  Alfred R. Waud .       Brannan sent three brigades in response to Thomas's order: Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer's brigade moved southeast on the Reed's Bridge Road, with Col. John Croxton's brigade on his right. Col. John Connell's brigade came up behind in reserve. Croxton's men drove back Davidson's advanced cavalrymen and Forrest formed a defensive line of dismounted troopers to stem the tide. Croxton halted his advance because he was unsure of Forrest's strength. Forrest requested reinforcements from Bragg and Walker near Alexander's Bridge and Walker ordered Col. Claudius Wilson's brigade forward about 9 a.m., hitting Croxton's right flank. Forrest protected his own right flank by deploying the brigade of Col. George Dibrell, which ran into Van Derveer's brigade and came to a halt under fire. Forrest sent in Brig. Gen. Matthew Ector's brigade, part of Walker's Reserve Corps, but without Walker's knowledge. Ector's men replaced Debrill's in line, but they were also unable to drive Van Derveer from his position. [ 44 ]   Brannan's division was holding its ground against Forrest and his infantry reinforcements, but their ammunition was running low. Thomas sent Baird's division to assist, which advanced with two brigades forward and one in reserve. Brig. Gen. John King's brigade of U.S. Army regulars relieved Croxton. The brigade of Col. Benjamin Scribner took up a position on King's right and Col. John Starkweather's brigade remained in reserve. With superior numbers and firepower, Scribner and King were able to start to push back Wilson and Ector. [ 45 ]   Bragg committed the division of Brig. Gen.  St. John R. Liddell  to the fight, countering Thomas's reinforcements. The brigades of Col. Daniel Govan and Brig. Gen. Edward Walthall advanced along the Alexander's Bridge Road, smashing Baird's right flank. Both Scribner's and Starkweather's brigades retreated in panic, followed by King's regulars, who dashed for the rear through Van Derveer's brigade. Van Derveer's men halted the Confederate advance with a concentrated volley at close range. Liddell's exhausted men began to withdraw and Croxton's brigade, returning to the action, pushed them back beyond the Winfrey field. [ 46 ]       The land between Chickamauga Creek and the LaFayette Road was gently rolling but almost completely wooded. ... In the woods no officer above brigadier could see all his command at once, and even the brigadiers often could see nobody's troops but their own and perhaps the enemy's. Chickamauga would be a classic ""soldiers battle,"" but it would test officers at every level of command in ways they had not previously been tested. An additional complication was that each army would be attempting to fight a shifting battle while shifting its own position. ... Each general would have to conduct a battle while shuffling his own units northward toward an enemy of whose position he could get only the vaguest idea. Strange and wonderful opportunities would loom out of the leaves, vines, and gunsmoke, be touched and vaguely sensed, and then fade away again into the figurative fog of confusion that bedeviled men on both sides. In retrospect, victory for either side would look simple when unit positions were reviewed on a neat map, but in Chickamauga's torn and smoky woodlands, nothing was simple.

Woodworth [ 47 ]       Believing that Rosecrans was attempting to move the center of the battle farther north than Bragg planned, Bragg began rushing heavy reinforcements from all parts of his line to his right, starting with Cheatham's division of Polk's Corps, with five brigades the largest in the Army of Tennessee. At 11 a.m., Cheatham's men approached Liddell's halted division and formed on its left. Three brigades under Brig. Gens. Marcus Wright, Preston Smith, and John Jackson formed the front line and Brig. Gens. Otho Strahl and George Maney commanded the brigades in the second line. Their advance greatly overlapped Croxton's brigade and had no difficulty pushing it back. As Croxton withdrew, his brigade was replaced by Brig. Gen. Richard Johnson's division of McCook's XX Corps near the LaFayette Road. Johnson's lead brigades, under Col. Philemon Baldwin and Brig. Gen. August Willich engaged Jackson's brigade, protecting Croxton's withdrawal. Although outnumbered, Jackson held under the pressure until his ammunition ran low and he called for reinforcements. Cheatham sent in Maney's small brigade to replace Jackson, but they were no match for the two larger Federal brigades and Maney was forced to withdraw as both of his flanks were crushed. [ 48 ]   Additional Union reinforcements arrived shortly after Johnson. Maj. Gen. John Palmer's division of Crittenden's corps marched from Lee and Gordon's Mill and advanced into the fight with three brigades in linethe brigades of Brig. Gen. William Hazen, Brig. Gen. Charles Cruft, and Col. William Groseagainst the Confederate brigades of Wright and Smith. Smith's brigade bore the brunt of the attack in the Brock field and was replaced by Strahl's brigade, which also had to withdraw under the pressure. Two more Union brigades followed Palmer's division, from Brig. Gen. Horatio Van Cleve's division of the XXI corps, who formed on the left flank of Wright's brigade. The attack of Brig. Gen. Samuel Beatty's brigade was the tipping point that caused Wright's brigade to join the retreat with Cheatham's other units. [ 49 ]          Actions, early afternoon of September 19.       For a third time, Bragg ordered a fresh division to move in, this time Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart 's (Buckner's corps) from its position at Thedford Ford around noon. Stewart encountered Wright's retreating brigade at the Brock farm and decided to attack Van Cleve's position on his left, a decision he made under his own authority. With his brigades deployed in column, Brig. Gen. Henry Clayton's was the first to hit three Federal brigades around the Brotherton Farm. Firing until their ammunition was gone, Clayton's men were replaced with Brig. Gen. John Brown's brigade. Brown drove Beatty's and Dick's men from the woods east of the LaFayette Road and paused to regroup. Stewart committed his last brigade, under Brig. Gen. William Bate, around 3:30 p.m. and routed Van Cleve's division. Hazen's brigade was caught up in the retreat as they were replenishing their ammunition. Col. James Sheffield's brigade from Hood's division drove back Grose's and Cruft's brigades. Brig. Gen. John Turchin's brigade (Reynolds's division) counterattacked and briefly held off Sheffield, but the Confederates had caused a major penetration in the Federal line in the area of the Brotherton and Dyer fields. Stewart did not have sufficient forces to maintain that position, and was forced to order Bate to withdraw east of the Lafayette Road. [ 50 ]          Brotherton Cabin.       At around 2 p.m, the division of Brig. Gen.  Bushrod R. Johnson  (Hood's corps) encountered the advance of Union Brig. Gen.  Jefferson C. Davis 's two brigade division of the XX corps, marching north from Crawfish Springs. Johnson's men attack Col. Hans Heg's brigade on Davis's left and forced it across the LaFayette Road. Hood ordered Johnson to continue the attack by crossing the LaFayette Road with two brigades in line and one in reserve. The two brigades drifted apart during the attack. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade attacked Col. John T. Wilder's Union brigade in its reserve position at the Viniard Farm. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, also lost their cohesion during the advance. [ 51 ]          Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19.       Union Brig. Gen.  Thomas J. Wood 's division was ordered to march north from Lee and Gordon's Mill around 3 p.m. His brigade under Col. George P. Buell was posted north of the Viniard house while Col. Charles Harker's brigade continued up the LaFayette Road. Harker's brigade arrived in the rear of Fulton's and McNair's Confederate regiments, firing into their backs. Although the Confederates retreated to the woods east of the road, Harker realized he was isolated and quickly withdrew. At the Viniard house, Buell's men were attacked by part of Brig. Gen.  Evander M. Law 's division of Hood's corps. The brigades of Brig. Gens.  Jerome B. Robertson  and  Henry L. Benning  pushed southwest toward the Viniard field, pushing back Brig. Gen. William Carlin's brigade (Davis's division) and fiercely struck Buell's brigade, pushing them back behind Wilder's line. Hood's and Johnson's men, pushing strongly forward, approached so close to new Rosecrans's headquarters at the tiny cabin of Widow Eliza Glenn that the staff officers inside had to shout to make themselves heard over the sounds of battle. There was a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. Wilder's men eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch. [ 52 ]   The Federals launched several unsuccessful counterattacks late in the afternoon to regain the ground around the Viniard house. Col. Heg was mortally wounded during one of these advances. Late in the day, Rosecrans deployed almost his last reserve, Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan 's division of McCook's corps. Marching north from Lee and Gordon's Mill, Sheridan took the brigades of Cols. Luther Bradley and Bernard Laiboldt. Bradley's brigade was in the lead and it was able to push the heavily outnumbered brigades of Robertson and Benning out of Viniard field. Bradley was wounded during the attack. [ 53 ]   By 6 p.m., darkness was falling, and Braxton Bragg had not abandoned his idea of pushing the Federal army to the south. He ordered Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division (Hill's corps) to join Polk on the army's right flank. This area of the battlefield had been quiet for several hours as the fighting moved progressively southward. George Thomas had been consolidating his lines, withdrawing slightly to the west to what he considered a superior defensive position. Richard Johnson's division and Absalom Baird's brigade were in the rear of Thomas's westward migration, covering the withdrawal. At sunset Cleburne launched an attack with three brigades in linefrom left to right, Brig. Gens. James Deshler, Sterling Wood, and Lucius Polk. The attack degenerated into chaos in the limited visibility of twilight and smoke from burning underbrush. Some of Absalom Baird's men advanced to support Baldwin's Union brigade, but mistakenly fired at them and were subjected to return  friendly fire . Baldwin was shot dead from his horse attempting to lead a counterattack. Deshler's brigade missed their objective entirely and Deshler was shot in the chest while examining ammunition boxes. Brig. Gen. Preston Smith led his brigade forward to support Deshler and mistakenly rode into the lines of Col. Joseph B. Dodge's brigade (Johnson's division), where he was shot down. By 9 p.m Cleburne's men retained possession of the Winfrey field and Johnson and Baird had been driven back inside Thomas's new defensive line. [ 54 ]   Casualties for the first day of battle are difficult to calculate because losses are usually reported for the entire battle. Historian Peter Cozzens wrote that ""an estimate of between 6,000 and 9,000 Confederates and perhaps 7,000 Federals seems reasonable."" [ 55 ]     [ edit ]   Planning for the second day   At Braxton Bragg's headquarters at Thedford Ford, the commanding general was officially pleased with the day's events. He reported that ""Night found us masters of the ground, after a series of very obstinate contests with largely superior numbers."" [ 56 ]  However, his attacks had been launched in a disjointed fashion, failing to achieve a concentration of mass to defeat Rosecrans or cut him off from Chattanooga. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas Connelly criticized Bragg's conduct of the battle on September 19, citing his lack of specific orders to his subordinates, and his series of ""sporadic attacks which only sapped Bragg's strength and enabled Rosecrans to locate the Rebel position."" He wrote that Bragg bypassed two opportunities to win the battle on September 19: [ 57 ]       Bragg's inability to readjust his plans had cost him heavily. He had never admitted that he was wrong about the location of Rosecrans' left wing and that as a result he bypassed two splendid opportunities. During the day Bragg might have sent heavy reinforcements to Walker and attempted to roll up the Union left; or he could have attacked the Union center where he knew troops were passing from to the left. Unable to decide on either, Bragg tried to do both, wasting his men in sporadic assaults. Now his Army was crippled and in no better position than that morning. Walker had, in the day's fighting, lost over 20 per cent of his strength, while Stuart and Cleburne had lost 30 per cent. Gone, too, was any hope for the advantage of a surprise blow against Rosecrans. [ 58 ]       Bragg met individually with his subordinates and informed them that he was reorganizing the Army of Tennessee into two wings. Leonidas Polk, the senior lieutenant general, was given the right wing and command of Hill's Corps, Walker's Corps, and Cheatham's Division. Polk was ordered to initiate the assault on the Federal left at daybreak, beginning with the division of Breckinridge, followed progressively by Cleburne, Stewart, Hood, McLaws, Bushrod Johnson, Hindman, and Preston. Informed that Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had finally reached the vicinity after a long train journey from Virginia, Bragg designated him as the left wing commander, commanding Hood's Corps, Buckner's Corps, and Hindman's Division of Polk's Corps. Longstreet did not personally receive these orders until 11 p.m. The third lieutenant general of the army,  D.H. Hill , was not informed directly by Bragg of his effective demotion to be Polk's subordinate, but he learned his status from a staff officer. [ 59 ]   What Hill did not learn was his role in the upcoming battle. The courier sent with written orders was not able to find Hill and returned to his unit without informing anyone. Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge , one of Hill's division commanders, was at Polk's headquarters but was not informed that his division was to initiate the dawn attack. At 5 a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened on the cold and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6 a.m. Hill responded with a number of reasons for delaying the attack, including readjustments of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men. Reluctantly, Bragg agreed. [ 60 ]   On the Union side, Rosecrans held a council of war with most of his corps and division commanders to determine a course of action for September 20. The Army of the Cumberland had been significantly hurt in the first day's battle and had only five fresh brigades available, whereas the Confederate army had been receiving reinforcements and now outnumbered the Federals. Both of these facts ruled out a Union offensive. The presence of Assistant Secretary of War  Charles A. Dana  at the meeting made any discussion of retreating difficult. Rosecrans decided that his army had to remain in place, on the defensive. He recalled that Bragg had retreated after  Perryville  and  Stones River  and could conceivably repeat that behavior. [ 61 ]   Rosecrans's defensive line consisted of Thomas in his present position, a salient that encompassed the Kelly Farm east of the LaFayette Road, which Thomas's engineers had fortified overnight with log breastworks. To the right, McCook withdrew his men from the Viniard field and anchored his right near the Widow Glenn's. Crittenden was placed into reserve and Granger, still concentrated at Rossville, was notified to be prepared to support either Thomas or McCook, although practically he could only support Thomas. [ 62 ]   Still before dawn, Baird reported to Thomas that his line stopped short of the intersection of the LaFayette and McFarland's Gap Roads, and that he could not cover it without weakening his line critically. Thomas requested that his division under James Negley be moved from McCook's sector to correct this problem. Rosecrans directed that McCook was to replace Negley in line, but he found soon afterward that Negley had not been relieved. He ordered Negley to send his reserve brigade to Thomas immediately and continued to ride on an inspection of the lines. On a return visit, he founded Negley was still in position and Thomas Wood's division was just arriving to relieve him. Rosecrans ordered Wood to expedite his relief of Negley's remaining brigades. Some staff officers later recalled that Rosecrans had been extremely angry and berated Wood in front of his staff, although Wood denied that this incident occurred. As Negley's remaining brigades move north, the first attack of the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga started. [ 63 ]     [ edit ]   September 20          Polk's Right Wing assaults, morning of September 20.       The battle on the second day began at about 9:30 a.m. on the left flank of the Union line, about four hours after Bragg had ordered the attack to start, with coordinated attacks planned by Breckinridge and Cleburne of D.H. Hill's Corps, Polk's Right Wing. Bragg's intention was that this would be the start of successive attacks progressing leftward,  en echelon , along the Confederate line, designed to drive the Union army south, away from its escape routes through the Rossville and McFarland Gaps. The late start was significant. At ""day-dawn"" there were no significant defensive breastworks constructed by Thomas's men yet; these formidable obstacles were built in the few hours after dawn. Bragg wrote after the war that if it were not for the loss of these hours, ""our independence might have been won."" [ 64 ]   Breckinridge's brigades under Brig. Gens.  Benjamin Helm ,  Marcellus A. Stovall , and  Daniel W. Adams  moved forward, left to right, in a single line. Helm's  Orphan Brigade  of Kentuckians was the first to make contact with Thomas's breastworks and Helm (the favorite brother-in-law of Abraham Lincoln) was mortally wounded while attempting to motivate his Kentuckians forward to assault the strong position. Breckinridge's other two brigades made better progress against the brigade of Brig. Gen.  John Beatty  (Negley's division), which was attempting to defend a line of a width more suitable for a division. As he found the left flank of the Union line, Breckinridge realigned his two brigades to straddle the LaFayette Road to move south, threatening the rear of Thomas's Kelly field salient. Thomas called up reinforcements from Brannan's reserve division and Col.  Ferdinand Van Derveer 's brigade charged Stovall's men, driving them back. Adams's Brigade was stopped by Col. Timothy Stanley's brigade of Negley's division. Adams was wounded and left behind as his men retreated to their starting position. [ 65 ]       Taken as a whole, the performance of the Confederate right wing this morning had been one of the most appalling exhibitions of command incompetence of the entire Civil War.    Six Armies in Tennessee , Steven E. Woodworth. [ 66 ]       The other part of Hill's attack also foundered. Cleburne's division met heavy resistance at the breastworks defended by the divisions of Baird, Johnson, Palmer, and Reynolds. Confusing lines of battle, including an overlap with Stewart's division on Cleburne's left, diminished the effectiveness of the Confederate attack. Cheatham's division, waiting in reserve, also could not advance because of Left Wing troops to their front. Hill brought up  Gist's  Brigade, commanded by Col. Peyton Colquitt, of Walker's Corps to fill the gap between Breckinridge and Cleburne. Colquitt was killed and his brigade suffered severe casualties in their aborted advance. Walker brought the remainder of his division forward to rescue the survivors of Gist's Brigade. On his right flank, Hill sent Col.  Daniel Govan 's brigade of Liddell's Division to support Breckinridge, but the brigade was forced to retreat along with Stovall's and Adams's men in the face of a Federal counterattack. [ 67 ]   The attack on the Confederate right flank had petered out by noon, but it caused great commotion throughout Rosecrans's army as Thomas sent staff officers to seek aid from fellow generals along the line. West of the Poe field, Brannan's division was manning the line between Reynolds's division on his left and Wood's on his right. His reserve brigade was marching north to aid Thomas, but at about 10 a.m. he received one of Thomas's staff officers asking for additional assistance. He knew that if his entire division were withdrawn from the line, it would expose the flanks of the neighboring divisions, so he sought Reynolds's advice. Reynolds agreed to the proposed movement, but sent word to Rosecrans warning him of the possibly dangerous situation that would result. However, Brannan remained in his position on the line, apparently wishing for Thomas's request to be approved by Rosecrans. The staff officer continued to think that Brannan was already in motion. Receiving the message on the west end of the Dyer field, Rosecrans, who assumed that Brannan had already left the line, desired Wood to fill the hole that would be created. His chief of staff, James A. Garfield, who would have known that Brannan was staying in line, was busy writing orders for parts of Sheridan's and Van Cleve's divisions to support Thomas. Rosecrans's order was instead written by Frank Bond, his senior aide-de-camp, generally competent but inexperienced at order-writing. As Rosecrans dictated, Bond wrote the following order: ""The general commanding directs that you close up on Reynolds as fast as possible, and support him."" This contradictory order was not reviewed by Rosecrans, who by this point was increasingly worn-out, and was sent to Wood directly, bypassing his corps commander Crittenden. [ 68 ]   Wood was perplexed by Rosecrans's order, which he received around 10:50 a.m. Since Brannan was still on his left flank, Wood would not be able to ""close up on"" (a military term that meant to ""move adjacent to"") Reynolds with Brannan's division in the way. Therefore, the only possibility was to withdraw from the line, march around behind Brannan and form up behind Reynolds (the military meaning of the word ""support""). This was obviously a risky move, leaving an opening in the line, but Wood had already been berated earlier that day for not promptly obeying an order, and was not inclined to question this one, even though a ride to Rosecrans's headquarters would have taken less than five minutes. Wood spoke with corps commander McCook, and claimed later that McCook agreed to fill the resulting gap with XX Corps units. McCook maintained that he had not enough units to spare to cover a division-wide hole, although he did send Heg's brigade to partially fill the gap. [ 69 ]   At about this time, Bragg also made a peremptory order based on incomplete information. Impatient that his attack was not progressing to the left, he sent orders for all of his commands to advance at once. Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart  of Longstreet's wing received the command and immediately ordered his division forward without consulting with Longstreet. His brigades under Brig. Gens.  Henry D. Clayton ,  John C. Brown , and  William B. Bate  attacked across the Poe field in the direction of the Union divisions of Brannan and Reynolds. Along with Brig. Gen.  S. A. M. Wood 's brigade of Cleburne's Division, Stewart's men disabled Brannan's right flank and pushed back Van Cleve's division in Brannan's rear, momentarily crossing the LaFayette Road. A Federal counterattack drove Stewart's Division back to its starting point. [ 70 ]          Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20.       Longstreet also received Bragg's order but did not act immediately. Surprised by Stewart's advance, he held up the order for the remainder of his wing. Longstreet had spent the morning attempting to arrange his lines so that his divisions from the Army of Northern Virginia would be in the front line, but these movements had resulted in the battle line confusion that had plagued Cleburne earlier. When Longstreet was finally ready, he had amassed a concentrated striking force, commanded by Maj. Gen.  John Bell Hood , of three divisions, with eight brigades arranged in five lines. In the lead, Brig. Gen.  Bushrod Johnson 's division straddled the Brotherton Road in two echelons. They were followed by Hood's Division, now commanded by Maj. Gen.  Evander M. Law , and two brigades of Maj. Gen.  Lafayette McLaws 's division, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Joseph B. Kershaw . To the left of this column was Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman 's division. Brig. Gen.  William Preston 's division of Buckner's corps was in reserve behind Hindman. [ 71 ]       The scene now presented was unspeakably grand. The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-armsof whistling balls and grape-shot and of bursting shellmade up a battle scene of unsurpassed grandeur.   Confederate Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson [ 72 ]       Longstreet gave the order to move at 11:10 a.m. and Johnson's division proceeded across the Brotherton field, by coincidence to precisely the point where Wood's Union division was pulling out of the line. Johnson's brigade on the left, commanded by Col. John S. Fulton, drove directly through the gap. The brigade on the right, under Brig. Gen.  Evander McNair , encountered opposition from Brannan's division (parts of Col. John M. Connell's brigade), but was also able to push through. The few Union soldiers in that sector ran in panic from the onslaught. At the far side of the Dyer field, several Union batteries of the XXI Corps reserve artillery were set up, but without infantry support. Although the Confederate infantrymen hesitated briefly, Gregg's brigade, commanded by Col. Cyrus Sugg, which flanked the guns on their right, Sheffield's brigade, commanded by Col. William Perry, and the brigade of Brig. Gen.  Jerome B. Robertson , captured 15 of the 26 cannons on the ridge. [ 73 ]   As the Union troops were withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade commanded by Col. Charles G. Harker and sent it back with orders to counterattack the Confederates. They appeared on the scene at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip. [ 74 ]          Defense of Horseshoe Ridge and Union retreat, afternoon and evening of September 20.              Defense of Horseshoe Ridge and Union retreat, brigade details.       Harker conducted a fighting withdrawal under pressure from Kershaw, retreating to Horseshoe Ridge near the tiny house of George Washington Snodgrass. Finding a good defensible position there, Harker's men were able to resist the multiple assaults, beginning at 1 p.m., from the brigades of Kershaw and Brig. Gen.  Benjamin G. Humphreys . These two brigades had no assistance from their nearby fellow brigade commanders. Perry and Robertson were attempting to reorganize their brigades after they were routed into the woods. Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning's brigade turned north after crossing the Lafayette Road in pursuit of two brigades of Brannan's division, then halted for the afternoon near the Poe house. [ 75 ]       My report today is of deplorable importance. Chickamauga is as fatal a name in our history as Bull Run.   Telegram to U.S. War Department, 4 p.m., Charles A. Dana [ 76 ]       Hindman's Division attacked the Union line to the south of Hood's column and encountered considerably more resistance. The brigade on the right, commanded by Brig. Gen. Zachariah Deas, drove back two brigades of Davis's division and defeated Col. Bernard Laiboldt's brigade of Sheridan's division. Sheridan's two remaining brigades, under Brig. Gen.  William H. Lytle  and Col. Nathan Walworth, checked the Confederate advance on a slight ridge west of the Dyer field near the Widow Glenn House. While leading his men in the defense, Lytle was killed and his men, now outflanked and leaderless, fled west. Hindman's brigade on the left, under Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault, crossed the field east of the Widow Glenn's house when Col.  John T. Wilder 's mounted infantry brigade, advancing from its reserve position, launched a strong counterattack with its Spencer repeating rifles, driving the enemy around and through what became known as ""Bloody Pond"". Having nullified Manigault's advance, Wilder decided to attack the flank of Hood's column. However, just then Assistant Secretary of War Dana found Wilder and excitedly proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to calm down the secretary and arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west. [ 77 ]       Whether he did or did not know that Thomas still held the field, it was a catastrophe that Rosecrans did not himself ride to Thomas, and send Garfield to Chattanooga. Had he gone to the front in person and shown himself to his men, as at Stone River, he might by his personal presence have plucked victory from disaster, although it is doubtful whether he could have done more than Thomas did. Rosecrans, however, rode to Chattanooga instead.    The Edge of Glory , Rosecrans biographer William M. Lamers [ 78 ]       All Union resistance at the southern end of the battlefield evaporated. Sheridan and Davis's divisions fled toward Missionary Ridge, taking with them elements of Van Cleve's and Negley's divisions. Rosecrans, Garfield, McCook, and Crittenden, although attempting to rally retreating units, soon joined them in the mad rush to safety. Near McFarland's Gap, Rosecrans and Garfield paused, deciding that Garfield would return to find Thomas while Rosecrans went to Chattanooga to organize his returning men. The provost marshal of the XIV Corps met Crittenden around the gap and offered him the services of 1000 men he had been able to round up during the retreat. Crittenden refused the command and continued his personal flight. [ 79 ]          Snodgrass house.       The entire Army of the Cumberland did not flee, however. Thomas's four divisions still held their lines around Kelly field and a strong defensive position was attracting men to Snodgrass Hill. Brannan and Wood began rallying men there and received a regiment from Negley's division, the 21st Ohio, a unit armed with five-shot Colt revolving rifles, to anchor the right flank of the position. Historian Steven E. Woodworth called the actions of the 21st Ohio ""one of the epic defensive stands of the entire war."" [ 80 ]  The 535 men of the regiment expended 43,550 rounds in the engagement. Stanley's brigade, which had been driven to the area by Govan's attack, took up a position on the portion of the ridge immediately south of the Snodgrass house, where they were joined by Harker's brigade on their left. This group of randomly selected units were the ones who beat back the initial assaults from Kershaw and Humphrey. Soon thereafter, the Confederate division of Bushrod Johnson advanced against the western end of the ridge, seriously threatening the Union flank. But as they reach the top of the ridge, they found that fresh Union reinforcements had arrived. [ 81 ]   Throughout the day, the sounds of battle had reached 3 miles north to McAfee's Church, where the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger  was stationed. Granger eventually lost patience and sent reinforcements south without receiving explicit orders [ 82 ]  to do sothe two brigades of Maj. Gen.  James B. Steedman 's division and the brigade of Col.  Daniel McCook . As the men marched, they were harassed by Forrest's dismounted cavalrymen and artillery, causing them to veer toward the west. McCook's brigade was left behind at the McDonald house to guard the rear and Steedman's two brigades reached the Union lines in the rear of the Horseshoe Ridge position, just as Johnson was starting his attack. Granger sent Steedman's men into Johnson's path on the run. [ 83 ]          Horseshoe Ridge,  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park , 2008.       Several attacks and counterattacks shifted the lines back and forth as Johnson received more and more reinforcementsMcNair's Brigade (commanded by Col. David Coleman), and Deas's and Manigault's brigades from Hindman's divisionbut many of these men were exhausted. Van Derveer's brigade arrived from the Kelly Field line to beef up the Union defense. Brig. Gen.  Patton Anderson 's brigade (Hindman's Division) unsuccessfully attempted to assault the hill in the gap between Johnson and Kershaw. Despite all the furious activity on Snodgrass Hill, Longstreet was exerting little direction on the battlefield, enjoying a leisurely lunch of bacon and sweet potatoes with his staff in the rear. Summoned to a meeting with Bragg, Longstreet asked the army commander for reinforcements from Polk's stalled wing, even though he had not committed his own reserve, Preston's division. Bragg was becoming distraught and told Longstreet that the battle was being lost, something Longstreet found inexplicable, considering the success of his assault column. Bragg knew, however, that his success on the southern end of the battlefield was merely driving his opponents to their escape route to Chattanooga and that the opportunity to destroy the Army of the Cumberland had evaporated. After the repeated delays in the morning's attacks, Bragg had lost confidence in his generals on the right wing, and while denying Longstreet reinforcements told him ""There is not a man in the right wing who has any fight in him."" [ 84 ]   Longstreet finally deployed Preston's division, which made several attempts to assault Horseshoe Ridge, starting around 4:30 p.m. Longstreet later wrote that there were 25 assaults in all on Snodgrass Hill, but historian Glenn Tucker has written that it was ""really one of sustained duration."" [ 85 ]  At that same time Thomas received an order from Rosecrans to take command of the army and began a general retreat. Thomas's divisions at Kelly field, starting with Reynolds's division, were the first to withdraw, followed by Palmer's. As the Confederates saw the Union soldiers withdrawing, they renewed their attacks, threatening to surround Johnson's and Baird's divisions. Although Johnson's division managed to escape relatively unscathed, Baird lost a significant number of men as prisoners. Thomas left Horseshoe Ridge, placing Granger in charge, but Granger departed soon thereafter, leaving no one to coordinate the withdrawal. Steedman, Brannan, and Wood managed to stealthily withdraw their divisions to the north. Three regiments that had been attached from other unitsthe 22nd Michigan, the 89th Ohio, and the 21st Ohiowere left behind without sufficient ammunition, ordered to use their bayonets. They held their position until surrounded by Preston's division, when they were forced to surrender. [ 86 ]     [ edit ]   Aftermath       While Rosecrans went to Chattanooga, Thomas and two thirds of the Union army were making a desperate yet magnificent stand that has become a proud part of the military epic of America. Thomas, Rosecrans' firm friend and loyal lieutenant, would thereafter justly be known as the Rock of Chickamauga.    The Edge of Glory , Rosecrans biographer William M. Lamers [ 78 ]       Thomas withdrew the remainder of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw, while his commander and peers fled, earned him the nickname  Rock of Chickamauga , derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, ""Thomas is standing like a rock."" [ 87 ]  Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that ""our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full."" Although he admitted that the troops were tired and hungry and nearly out of ammunition, he added ""I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory."" He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted to prop up the morale of his general, telegraphing ""Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. If I was to suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you."" Privately, Lincoln told  John Hay  that Rosecrans seemed ""confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head."" [ 88 ]   The Army of Tennessee camped for the night, unaware that the Union army had slipped from their grasp. Bragg was not able to mount the kind of pursuit that would have been necessary to cause Rosecrans significant further damage. Many of his troops had arrived hurriedly at Chickamauga by rail, without wagons to transport them and many of the artillery horses had been injured or killed during the battle. Furthermore, the Tennessee River was now an obstacle to the Confederates and Bragg had no pontoon bridges to effect a crossing. Bragg's army paused at Chickamauga to reorganize and gather equipment lost by the Union army. Although Rosecrans had been able to save most of his trains, large quantities of ammunition and arms had been left behind. Army of Tennessee historian Thomas L. Connelly has criticized Bragg's performance, claiming that for over four hours on the afternoon of September 20, he missed several good opportunities to prevent the Federal escape, such as by a pursuit up the Dry Valley Road to McFarland's Gap, or by moving a division, such as Cheatham's, around Polk to the north to seize the Rossville Gap or McFarland's Gap via the Reed's Bridge Road. [ 89 ]   The battle was damaging to both sides in proportions roughly equal to the size of the armies: Union losses were 16,170 (1,657 killed, 9,756 wounded, and 4,757 captured or missing), Confederate 18,454 (2,312 killed, 14,674 wounded, and 1,468 captured or missing). [ 4 ]  These were the highest losses of any battle in the  Western Theater  during the war and, after  Gettysburg , the second highest of the war overall. [ 90 ]  Although the Confederates were technically the victors, driving Rosecrans from the field, Bragg had not achieved his objective of destroying Rosecrans, nor of restoring Confederate control of East Tennessee. [ 91 ]       It seems to me that the  elan  of the Southern soldier was never seen after Chickamauga. ... He fought stoutly to the last, but, after Chickamauga, with the sullenness of despair and without the enthusiasm of hope. That 'barren victory' sealed the fate of the Confederacy.   Confederate Lt. Gen. D.H. Hill [ 92 ]       On September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. Unable to break the siege, Rosecrans was relieved of his command of the Army of the Cumberland on October 19, replaced by Thomas. McCook and Crittenden lost their commands on September 28 as the XX Corps and the XXI Corps were consolidated into a new IV Corps commanded by Granger; neither officer would ever command in the field again. On the Confederate side, Bragg began to wage a battle against the subordinates he resented for failing him in the campaignHindman for his lack of action in McLemore's Cove, and Polk for his late attack on September 20. On September 29, Bragg suspended both officers from their commands. In early October, an attempted mutiny of Bragg's subordinates resulted in D.H. Hill being relieved from his command. Longstreet was dispatched with his corps to the Knoxville Campaign against  Ambrose Burnside , seriously weakening Bragg's army at Chattanooga. [ 93 ]   The Chickamauga Campaign was followed by the  Battles for Chattanooga , sometimes called the Chattanooga Campaign, including the reopening of supply lines and the Battles of Lookout Mountain (November 23) and Missionary Ridge, (November 25). Relief forces commanded by Maj. Gen.  Ulysses S. Grant  broke Bragg's grip on the city, sent the Army of Tennessee into retreat, and opened the gateway to the Deep South for Maj. Gen.  William T. Sherman 's 1864  Atlanta Campaign . [ 94 ]   Much of the central Chickamauga battlefield is preserved by the  National Park Service  as part of the  Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park .

The  Essex  carriers formed the core of the fast carrier task forces that struck Japanese forces in the Pacific with devastating results.  Yorktown 's planes inflicted heavy losses on the enemy at Truk and in the Marianas; the carrier supported American troops in the Philippines, at Iwo Jima, and at Okinawa.  Yorktown  received 11 battle stars for her World War II service and was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. For service off Vietnam she was awarded four battle stars.    Yorktown  and other  Essex  class carriers were the core of the U.S. postwar fleet. After Korean War duty,  Yorktown  was modernized for antisubmarine warfare and was deployed to Vietnam. In 1968, the carrier recovered the crew of Apollo 8, the first manned flight to orbit the moon. Decommissioned in 1970,  Yorktown  became the centerpiece of the fleet of ships at Patriots Point in 1975. Her onboard exhibits include more than two dozen historic carrier aircraft that saw service in World War II and the Persian Gulf War.  Yorktown  conducts youth group overnight encampments.   As the National Memorial to Carrier Aviation,  Yorktown  serves as host to the following memorials: the Arlington of Carrier Aviation, the Carrier Aviation Test Pilots Hall of Honor, the Carrier Aviation Hall of Fame. the Carrier Aviation Combat Aircraft Exhibit, and the Combat Aircrew Roll of Honor.  Yorktown  also serves as the headquarters for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society and the Congressional Medal of Honor Museum.   USS  Yorktown  is a National Historic Landmark.

[ edit ]   Overall design features   The types shared a common structure of a conventional single-bay biplane with staggered wings braced by N-struts. The fuselage was of fabric-covered steel tube and included two open cockpits in tandem, the forward of which could carry two passengers side-by-side.   Like other aircraft in the Travel Air line, it was available with a variety of different, interchangeable wings, including a wing shorter and thinner than the rest known as the ""Speedwing"" designed, as the name suggests, for increased performance. Travel Air entered a specially-modified Model 4000 (designated  4000-T ) in the  Guggenheim Safe Aircraft Competition  of 1930, but it was disqualified.     [ edit ]   Curtiss-Wright production   Following Travel Air's purchase in August 1929 [ 4 ]  by Curtiss-Wright, the Model 4000 continued in production into the early 1930s as the CW-14, and the range was expanded to include a military derivative dubbed the  Osprey . This was fitted with bomb racks, a fixed, forward-firing machine gun, and a trainable tail gun. These aircraft were supplied to Bolivia and used during the  Gran Chaco War , which eventually led to Curtiss-Wright's successful prosecution for supplying these aircraft in violation of a U.S. arms embargo.     [ edit ]   Travelair survivors   In 2007, a small number of Travel Air 2000/3000/4000s remain flying along with numerous examples that are preserved in museums. Exhibited examples include those at the  National Air and Space Museum , the  EAA AirVenture Museum , the  Reynolds-Alberta Museum , and the  Virginia Aviation Museum . [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Variants     Model B  -  Travel Air Model A  fitted with  Wright J-6  engine     Like other Travel Air aircraft, Model 4000 variants were distinguished by letters prefixed (or occasionally affixed) to the basic designation to denote different engine and wing fits. These letter codes included:     A  - original wing with ""elephant-ear"" ailerons   A  - Axelson engine   B  - ""standard wing"" with Frise-type ailerons and three fuel tanks   C  - Curtiss engine   D  - ""speedwing""   E  - revised ""standard wing"" with a single fuel tank   K  - Kinner engine   L  - Lycoming engine   W  - Warner engine     Curtiss-Wright models built included:     CW-14C Sportsman  - version with  Curtiss Challenger  engine (1 built)   CW-A14D Deluxe Sportsman  - three-seat version with  Wright J-6  engine and  NACA cowling  (5 built)   CW-B14B Speedwing Deluxe  - version with Wright J-6 engine (2 built)   CW-B14R Special Speedwing Deluxe  - single-seat racer built for  Casey Lambert  with supercharged  Wright R-975  engine (1 built)   CW-C14B Osprey  - militarized version with Wright R-975E engine   CW-C14R Osprey  - militarized version with Wright J-6-9 engine   CW-17R Pursuit Osprey  - CW-B14B with uprated engine; possibly not built         [ edit ]   Specifications (CW-A14D)   General characteristics     Crew:  One pilot   Capacity:  2 passengers   Length:  23 ft 7 in (7.17 m)   Wingspan:  31 ft 0 in (9.44 m)   Height:  9 ft 2 in (2.78 m)   Wing area:  248 ft (23.0 m)   Empty weight:  1,772 lb (804 kg)   Gross weight:  2,870 lb (1,302 kg)   Powerplant:  1   Wright J-6 -7, 240 hp (180 kW)     Performance     Maximum speed:  155 mph (249 km/h)   Range:  600 miles (966 km)   Service ceiling:  16,000 ft (4,880 m)   Rate of climb:  1,000 ft/min (5.1 m/s)       [ edit ]   References     Notes         ^   Simpson 2007 , p. 553   ^   Simpson 2007 , p. 553   ^   Simpson 2007 , p. 553   ^   Simpson 2001 , p. 553   ^   Ogden 2007 , p. 541         Bibliography         Ogden, Bob (2007).

Bush  in a Border Patrol  dune buggy       The  United States Border Patrol  is a  federal law enforcement agency  within  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), a component of the  Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). Its 18,049 agents (projected to be over 20,000 by the end of 2009) [ 1 ]  are primarily responsible for immigration and border law enforcement as codified in the  Immigration and Nationality Act . Their duty is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States and to deter, detect, and apprehend illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who enter the United States other than through designated ports of entry.   Additionally, the Border Patrol enforces federal controlled substances laws (as codified in the  Controlled Substances Act ) when violations occur or are found during the enforcement of federal immigration laws, via  delegated authority  from the  Drug Enforcement Administration .

The inspectors, usually called ""mounted guards"", operated out of  El Paso, Texas . Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as  California  trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.   In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as ""mounted inspectors"". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the  National Origins Act  and  Chinese Exclusion Act  of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times.  U.S. Army  troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to ""the more serious work of military training."" Non-nationals encountered illegally in the U.S. by the army were directed to the immigration inspection stations.  Texas Rangers  were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as ""singularly effective"".   The Border Patrol was founded on  May 28 ,  1924  as an agency of the  United States Department of Labor  to prevent  illegal entries  along the  MexicoUnited States border . Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to insure that non-American crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the  Eastern Seaboard  during the sixties when Cuba came under dictatorial control and entertained ideas of establishing USSR missile bases there.   Prior to 2003, the Border Patrol was part of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS), an agency that was within the  U.S. Department of Justice . INS was disbanded in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP,  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .   The priority mission of the Border Patrol, as a result of the  9/11 attacks  and its merging into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent  terrorists  and terrorist weapons from entering the  United States of America . However, the Border Patrol's traditional mission remains as the deterrence, detection and apprehension of  illegal immigrants  and individuals involved in the  illegal drug trade  who generally enter the United States other than through designated  ports of entry . The Border Patrol also operates 33 permanent  interior checkpoints  along the southern border of the United States.   Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol employs over 17,600 agents (as of the end of fiscal year 2008), [ 2 ]  who are specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents are assigned primarily to the  MexicoUnited States border , where they are assigned to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. [ 3 ]  Patrols on horseback have made a comeback since smugglers have been pushed into the more remote mountainous regions, which are hard to cover with modern tracking strategies. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Strategy     [ edit ]   1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement          Border Patrol Agents with a  HMMWV  and  Astar  patrol for illegal entry into U.S.       The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal immigrants. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal immigrants to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as ""employer sanctions"". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the  Livermore Sector  in Northern California.   Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed  Proposition 187 , denying benefits to illegal immigrants and criminalizing illegal immigrants in possession of forged green cards, I.D. cards and Social Security Numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal immigrants to the  INS . Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.     [ edit ]   Deterrence becomes the new strategy          A U.S. Border Patrol  Ford F-250  pick-up truck at the Tijuana-San Ysidro border crossing. Seen behind the truck is the U.S.-Mexico border fence.       In response to illegal immigration in 1994, the Border Patrol came up with a new strategy for addressing illegal immigrants. In 1992, ""over half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600 border miles13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles (8.0 km) along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico."" [ 5 ]  In 1991,  Office of National Drug Control Policy  commissioned  Sandia National Laboratory  to study more effective ways of stopping the flow of aliens and drugs into the United States. The ""Sandia Study"" concluded that the Border Patrol's traditional method of apprehension was ineffective. The Sandia Study recommended deterrence and the use of technology (cameras) and infrastructure (fences and other barriers) to control illegal immigration and drug smuggling. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Southern border     [ edit ]   El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line   El Paso  Sector Chief Patrol Agent (and future U.S. congressman)  Silvestre Reyes  started a program called ""Operation Hold the Line"". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to  illegal entries  resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande River, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.     [ edit ]   San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper          A Border Patrol  Jeep  stands watch over the  U.S.-Mexico border  at  San Ysidro, California .       San Diego Sector tried  Silvestre Reyes ' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector. [ citation needed ]  In addition, Congressman  Duncan Hunter  obtained surplus military landing mats to use as a border fence. [ citation needed ]  Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. [ citation needed ]  Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as people crossed in different regions.     [ edit ]   Tucson Sector's Operation Safeguard   California was no longer the hotbed of illegal entry and the traffic shifted to Arizona, primarily in  Nogales  and  Douglas . [ citation needed ]  The Border Patrol instituted the same deterrent strategy it used in San Diego to Arizona.     [ edit ]   Northern border   In 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 340 agents assigned along the  Canada  United States border  border. Northern border staffing had been increased to 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a sixfold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.   The northern border sectors are Blaine (Washington), Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Havre (Montana), Houlton (Maine), Spokane (Washington), and Swanton (Vermont).     [ edit ]   Border Patrol moves away from interior enforcement   In the 1990s, Congress mandated that the Border Patrol shift agents away from the interior and focus them on the borders.   After the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the Department of Homeland Security created two immigration enforcement agencies out of the defunct  Immigration and Naturalization Service :  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) and the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal immigrants, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing illegal entries between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP itself is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal authority absolutely nationwide.   In July 2004, the Livermore Sector of the United States Border Patrol was closed. Livermore Sector served Northern California and included stations at  Dublin  ( Parks Reserve Forces Training Area ),  Sacramento ,  Stockton ,  Fresno  and  Bakersfield . The Border Patrol also closed other stations in the interior of the United States including  Roseburg, Oregon  and  Little Rock, Arkansas ]. The Border Patrol functions in these areas consisted largely of local jail and transportation terminal checks for illegal immigrants. These functions were turned over to  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .     [ edit ]   The new strategy          Cameras add ""Smart Border"" surveillance.       In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy. [ 7 ]  The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives:     Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States;   Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement;   Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband;   Use ""smart border"" technology; and   Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.       [ edit ]   Capabilities   The border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by  unmanned aerial vehicles . [ 8 ]   The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is ""Line Watch"". Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities. [ 9 ]   Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics. [ 10 ]   Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft. [ 11 ]   Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components. [ 12 ]   Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch. [ 13 ]  Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.     [ edit ]   Expansion   Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995-2001 attrition spiked to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was undergoing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely due to agents transferring to the  Federal Air Marshals  after  9/11 . Since that time the attrition problem has decreased significantly and Congress has increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from GS-9 to GS-11 in the  General Schedule  in 2002. In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4%. [ 14 ]   The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004 (signed by President Bush on  December 17 ,  2004 ) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, ""subject to appropriation"". This authorization, if fully implemented, would nearly double the Border Patrol manpower from 11,000 to 21,000 agents by 2010.   In July 2005, Congress signed the  Emergency Supplemental Spending Act  for military operations in Iraq/Afghanistan and other operations. The act also appropriated funding to increase Border Patrol manpower by 500 Agents. In October 2005, President Bush also signed the DHS FY06 Appropriation bill, funding an additional 1,000 Agents.   In November 2005, President George W. Bush made a trip to southern Arizona to discuss more options that would decrease illegal crossings at the U.S. and Mexican border. In his proposed fiscal year 2007 budget he has requested an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents.   The Secure Fence Act, signed by President George W. Bush on  October 26 ,  2006 , has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the 1,945-mile (3,130 km) border, but the act requires only 700 miles (1,100 km) of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence. [ 17 ]  Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area. [ 18 ]  Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected due to the fact that a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy. [ 19 ]   Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande River be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.

[ edit ]   Border Patrol Sectors   There are 20 Border Patrol sectors, each headed by a Sector Chief Patrol Agent.   Northern Border (West to East):     Spokane  Sector ( Western Washington State )   Spokane  Sector ( Eastern Washington State )   Havre  Sector ( Montana )   Grand Forks  Sector ( North Dakota )   Detroit  Sector ( Selfridge Air National Guard Base ,  Michigan )   Buffalo  Sector ( New York )   Swanton  Sector ( Vermont )   Houlton  Sector ( Maine )     Southern Border (West to East):     San Diego  Sector (San Diego, California)   El Centro  Sector ( Imperial County, California )   Yuma  Sector (Western  Arizona )   Tucson  Sector (Eastern Arizona)   El Paso  Sector (  El Paso, Texas  and  New Mexico )   Marfa  Sector ( Big Bend Area of West Texas )   Del Rio  Sector ( El Paso, Texas ) - stations; Abilene, Brackettville, Carrizo Springs, Comstock, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Rocksprings, San Angelo, Uvalde   Rio Grande Valley  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Falfurrias, Fort Brown, Harlingen, Kingsville, McAllen, Rio Grande City, Weslaco   Laredo  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Cotulla , Dallas , Freer , Hebbronville , Laredo North , Laredo South , Laredo West , San Antonio , Zapata   New Orleans  Sector ( Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama , and West Florida]])   Miami  Sector ( Florida  East and South)     Caribbean     Ramey  Sector ( Aguadilla ,  Puerto Rico ) and the  Virgin Islands , it is the only Border Patrol Sector located outside the continental United States       [ edit ]   Training   All Border Patrol Agents spend 11 weeks in training at the Border Patrol Academy (if they are fluent in Spanish) in  Artesia, New Mexico , which is a component of the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  (FLETC).Those who are not fluent in Spanish spend an additional eight weeks at the Academy. Recruits are instructed in Border Patrol and federal law enforcement subjects.   Border Patrol courses include: Immigration and Nationality Law, Criminal Law and Statutory Authority, Spanish, Border Patrol Operations, Care and Use of Firearms, Physical Training, Operation of Motor Vehicles, and Anti-Terrorism.   FLETC courses include: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law. [ 22 ]   The physical aspects of the Border Patrol Training Program are extremely demanding. At the end of 55 days, trainees must be able to complete a one and a half mile run in 13 minutes or less, a confidence course in two and a half minutes or less, and a 220 yard dash in 46 seconds or less. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Uniforms   The Border Patrol currently wears the following types of uniforms:          CBP officers at a ceremony in 2007         Dress uniform  The dress uniform consists of brown-gray trousers with a blue-gray stripe, and an brown-gray shirt, which may or may not have blue-gray shoulder straps. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Ceremonial uniform  When required, the following items are added to the dress uniform to complete the ceremonial uniform: brown-gray Ike jacket  or  tunic  with blue-gray accents ( shoulder straps  and  cuffs , blue tie, brass tie tack, white gloves, and brown-gray felt  campaign hat  with leather hat band. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Rough duty uniform  The rough duty uniform consists of black work trousers and work shirt (in short or long sleeves). Usually worn with black  baseball cap  or gray  stetson .   Accessories, footwear, and outerwear  Additional items are worn in matching blue-gray or black colors as appropriate.   Organization patches  The Border Patrol wears two:    The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a ""keystone"" shape. A ""keystone"" is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.   Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.         The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb. [ 24 ]  Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by lightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

This Award is bestowed to Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty. It is also presented to agents for extraordinary contributions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.   This award is named for Border Patrol Inspectors Newton [ 25 ]  and Azrak, [ 26 ]  who were murdered by two drug smugglers in San Diego County in 1967.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).   Like other law enforcement agencies, the  Remington 870  is the standard shotgun.   Border Patrol Agents also commonly carry the  M4 Carbine  and the  H&K UMP  40 cal.     [ edit ]   Transportation          USBP Air and Marine Intrepid and SafeBoat vessels with a UH-1 Huey near San Diego, Calif.       Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates several thousand  SUVs  and  pickup trucks , which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. This vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as speed radar,  breathalyzers , and emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the  Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor  or the  Dodge Charger  as patrol cars or high speed ""interceptors"" on highways. The Border Patrol also operates  ATVs ,  motorcycles ,  snowmobiles , small boats,  helicopters , and  light aircraft .   Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle or a broad green diagonal stripe on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white.   The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. The  U.S. Border Patrol  has 205 horses As of 2005 [update] . Most are employed along the  MexicoUnited States border . In  Arizona , these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

Agents stationed at  Ajo, Arizona  said that the Mexican soldiers crossed the border into an isolated area southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who has not been identified. The Mexicans withdrew after other American agents arrived on the scene. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Ramos and Compean   In February 2005, Border Patrol Agents  Ignacio Ramos  and  Jose Compean  were involved in an incident while pursuing a van in  Fabens, Texas . The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors. The Department of Homeland Security opened up an  internal affairs  investigation into the incident.

The film claimed that this is due to the lack of judicial powers of the Border Patrol and the effective hamstringing of the agency by the  federal government . The film interviews people that deal with illegal immigration on a daily basis, as well as local  citizens  living in the border areas.     [ edit ]   Allegations of abuse     There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the  Houston Journal of International Law  (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the ""serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public"" and that ""illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents"". [ 35 ]       In 1998,  Amnesty International  investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service , and particularly the  Border Patrol . Their report said they found indications of  human rights  violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998. [ 36 ]       An article in  Journal  by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the ""vast majority"" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as ""verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."" [ 37 ]       [ edit ]   Corruption   Incidences of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include:     Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal immigrant, three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document. [ 38 ]  He plead guilty. [ 39 ]   Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal immigrant for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol agent. [ 40 ]   Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose  girlfriend  was an illegal immigrant, he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation. [ 40 ]   Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal immigrant [ 41 ]  who used a fake  birth certificate  to get into the Border Patrol admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal immigrants into the U.S., some of them in his government truck, [ 42 ]  and was helping to smuggle illegal immigrants and charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle immigrants.   An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wire tap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 immigrants at a time. [ 41 ]       [ edit ]   National Border Patrol Council   National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the  labor union  which represents over 14,000 Border Patrol Agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded in 1967, and its parent organization is the  American Federation of Government Employees ,  AFL-CIO . The NBPC's executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol Agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the  Peace Officer Research Association  of  Californias Legal Defense Fund .

According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic was inefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control the border. In addition, the authors said the only good border control strategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border. The study concluded that the way to prevent  illegal entry  is to impose ""effective barriers on the free flow of traffic."" The study noted that where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the United States, they should be stopped at the earliest opportunity. In addition, the Sandia study concluded that ""control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained"" and recommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics from apprehending illegal immigrants after they have entered the United States to preventing illegal entry into the United States.   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^  Nunez-Neto, Blas, Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol, Congressional Research Service, Updated  January 25 ,  2006 ,  [3] , Page 35   ^  Coyle, Marcia.""Waivers for border fence challenged: Environmental groups take their complaints to Supreme Court.""

(July 2008)       An  American Civil War reenactment  is an effort to recreate the appearance of a particular  battle  or other event associated with the  American Civil War  by  hobbyists  known (in the  United States ) as  Civil War reenactors  or  Civil War recreationists . Although most common in the United States, there are also American Civil War reenactors in  Canada , [ 1 ]  the  United Kingdom , [ 2 ]  and  Germany .

Civil War  veterans  recreated battles as a way to remember their fallen comrades and to teach others what the war was all about. [ 4 ]  The  Great Reunion of 1913 , celebrating the 50th anniversary of the  Battle of Gettysburg , was attended by more than 50,000  Union  and  Confederate  veterans, and included reenactments of elements of the battle, including  Pickett's Charge . [ 5 ]   Modern reenacting is thought to have began during the 1961-1965 Civil War centennial commemorations. [ 6 ]  Reenacting grew in popularity during the 1980's and 1990's, due in large part to the success of the 125th Anniversary reenactment near the original Manassas battlefield, which was attended by more than 6,000 reenactors. [ 7 ]  That year,  Time Magazine  estimated that there were more than 50,000 reenactors in the US. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Participation     See also:  List of historical reenactment groups            Reenactment at the  American Museum  in  Bath ,  England       American Civil War  reenactments have drawn a fairly sizable following of enthusiastic participants, young and old, willing to brave the elements and expend money and resources in their efforts to duplicate the events down to the smallest recorded detail. Participants may even attend classes put on by event sponsors where they learn how to dress, cook, eat, and even ""die"" just as real Civil War soldiers would have. Most reenactments have anywhere from 100 to 1,000 participants, portraying either Union or Confederate infantry, artillery, or cavalry forces. Some people, though uncommon, may portray Engineers or Marines. The 135th anniversary Gettysburg reenactment (1998) is generally believed to be the most-attended reenactment, with attendance estimates ranging from 15,000 [ 9 ]  to over 20,000 reenactors. [ 10 ]   Reasons given for participating in such activities vary. Some participants are interested in getting a  historical  perspective on the turbulent times that gripped the nation, particularly if they can trace their ancestry back to those who fought in the war. In some cases, if there are not enough Union soldiers present, Confederate soldiers are asked to change sides, or become  galvanized yankees , for the day/event. [ 11 ]   Although many periods are reenacted around the world, Civil War reenactment is, by far, the most popular activity in the US, [ 12 ]  with an estimated 50,000 Civil War reenactors as of 2000. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Categories of Reenactors   Reenactors are commonly divided (or self-divide) into three categories, based on the level of concern for  authenticity . [ 12 ] [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Farbs          An  American Civil War  reenactor talks about life in a typical army field camp. Hard-core reenactors would consider him ""farby"" because of his weight, as well as the modern cigarette he is holding.       Some, called "" Farbs "" or ""polyester soldiers"" [ 15 ]  are reenactors who spend relatively little of their time or money maintaining authenticity with regard to uniforms, accessories, or even period behavior. The 'Good Enough' attitude is pervasive among farbs, although even casual observers may be able to point out flaws. Blue jeans, tennis shoes, polyester (and other man-made fabrics), zippers,  velcro ,  snoods , and modern cigarettes are common issues.   The origin of the word ""farb"" (and the derivative adjective ""farby"") is unknown, though it appears to date to early centennial reenactments in 1960 or 1961. [ 16 ]  Some think that the origin of the word is a truncated version of ""Far be it from authentic."" [ citation needed ]  An alternative definition is ""Far Be it for me to question/criticise"", [ 17 ] [ 18 ]  or ""Fast And Researchless Buying"". [ 19 ] Some early reenactors assert the word derives from German  farbe , color, because inauthentic reenactors were over-colorful compared with the dull blues, greys or browns of the real Civil War uniforms that were the principal concern of American reenactors at the time the word was coined, [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  or the German  farbische , manufactured, indicating obviously modern items. [ 22 ]  According to Mr. Burton K. Kummerow, a member of ""The Black Hats, CSA"" reeanctment group in the early 1960s, he first heard it used as a form of fake German to describe a fellow reenactor. The term was picked up by George Gorman of the 2nd North Carolina at the Centennial Manassas Reenactment in 1961, and has been used by reenactors ever since. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Mainstream          A mainstream Federal  artillery  reenactor.       Another group of reenactors often is called ""Mainstream."" These reenactors are somewhere between  farb  and authentic. They are more common than either  farbs  or authentics. [ citation needed ]   Most mainstream reenactors make an effort at appearing authentic, but may come out of character in the absence of an audience. Visible stitches are likely to be sewn in a period-correct manner, but hidden stitches and undergarments may not be period-appropriate. Food consumed before an audience is likely to be generally appropriate to the early 1860s, but it may not be seasonally and locally appropriate. Modern items are sometimes used ""after hours"" or in a hidden fashion. The common attitude is to put on a good show, but that accuracy need only go as far as others can see. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Progressive   At the other extreme from farbs are ""hard-core authentics"" or ""progressives,"" as they prefer to be called. [ 24 ]  Sometimes derisively called ""stitch counters"", [ 25 ]  many people have misconceptions about hardcore reenactors, [ 26 ]  which spawn from a published book about hardcore reenactors,  Confederates in the Attic . [ citation needed ]  Hard-cores generally seek an ""immersive"" reenacting experience, trying to live, as much as possible, as someone of the 1860s might have. This includes eating seasonally and regionally appropriate food, sewing inside seams and undergarments in a period-appropriate manner, and staying in character throughout an event. [ 27 ]   Hard-core reenactors generally value thorough research, and sometimes deride mainstream reenactors for perpetuating inaccurate ""reenactorisms"", such as buttoning only the top button of a uniform jacket/coat, or insisting that a vest, jacket, or coat must be worn over a shirt at all times. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Types of Civil War reenactments     See also:  List of historical reenactment events     There are five loose categories of Civil War reenactments. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Total immersion events (Events By Us For Us, or EBUFU)   Total immersion events are made up solely of authentic reenactors, who march, live, eat and act like actual soldiers of the Civil War. These events are usually not public, meaning that the public cannot come and watch (it is for the reenactors amusement only)     [ edit ]   Living histories   Living histories are meant entirely for education of the public. Such events do not necessarily have a mock battle but instead are aimed at portraying the life, and more importantly the lifestyle, of the average Civil War soldier. This does include civilian reenacting, a growing trend. Occasionally, a spy trial is recreated,and a medic too. More common are weapons and cooking demonstrations, song and leisure activities, and lectures. These should not, however, be confused with  Living history museums . These outlets for living history utilize museum professionals and trained interpreters in order to convey the most accurate information available to historians.   Living history is the only reenactment permitted on National Park Service land; NPS policy ""does not allow for battle reenactments (simulated combat with opposing lines and casualties) on NPS property.""  [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Public demonstrations          Public demonstration in a parade for the sesquicentennial of  Red Wing, Minnesota .       Public demonstrations are smaller mock battles put on by reenacting organizations and/or private parties primarily to show the public how people in the 1860s lived, and to show the public civil war battles. The battles are only loosely based on actual battles, if at all, and may consist of demonstrations of basic tactics and maneuvering techniques.     [ edit ]   Tactical battles       Main article:  Tactical event       Tactical battles, which are not usually open to the public, [ 29 ]  are fought like real battles with each side devising strategies and tactics to defeat their opponent(s). They have no script, a basic set of agreed-upon rules (physical boundaries, time limit, victory conditions, etc.), and onsite judges or referees, [ 30 ]  and so could be considered a form of  live action role-playing game . Tactical battles might also be considered a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Time Bandits   ""Time bandit"" is a term to describe a historian who uses reenactment as part of their research. Often, this type of work is not seen a public events, so mauch as it is seen at museums, at special encampments, or in special circumstances. [ 32 ]  Examples might be using a reproduction of a stone age axe to chop down trees to measure the effectiveness of the tools. Or it can be the re-building of a kiln and using it to see first hand how the work was carried out. Alternately, it can be reenacting the use of cave dirt to manufacture potassium nitrate to imitate the work done in 1861, to measure the productivity of the Confederate chemists and the economy of using slave labor versus child labor for this work. [ 33 ]  Time bandits are also used as a form of  experimental archaeology . [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Scripted battles   Scripted battles are reenactment in the strictest sense; the battles are planned out beforehand so that the companies and regiments make the same actions that the were taken in the original battles. They are often fought at or near the original battle ground or at a place very similar to the original.     [ edit ]   Reenactment and media   Motion picture and television producers often turn to reenactment groups for support; films like  Gettysburg  and  Glory  benefited greatly from the input of reenactors, who arrived on set fully equipped and steeped in knowledge of military procedures, camp life, and tactics. [ 35 ]   In a documentary about the making of the film  Gettysburg , actor  Sam Elliott , who portrayed Union General  John Buford  in the film, said of reenactors:          I think we're really fortunate to have those people involved. In fact, they couldn't be making this picture without them; there's no question about that. These guys come with their wardrobe, they come with their weaponry. They come with all the accoutrements, but they also come with the stuff in their head and the stuff in their heart.          [ 36 ]   At times, however, the relationship between reenactors and filmmakers has been contentious. Although reenactors for  Gettysburg  were unpaid, money was contributed on their behalf to a trust for historic preservation; however, some subsequent productions have offered no such compensation. Also, in some cases reenactors have clashed with directors over one-sided portrayals and historical inaccuracies. [ 37 ]  Some producers have been less interested in accuracy than in the sheer number of reenactors, which can result in safety issues. Finally, large movie productions, like  Gettysburg , can draw enough reenactors to cause the cancellation of other events.

Operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean areas until April 1939, she then spent the next two years in the Pacific. In May 1941  Yorktown  returned to the Atlantic, patrolling actively during the troubled months preceding the outbreak of war between the United States and the Axis powers.    Two weeks after the 7 December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,  Yorktown  transited the Panama Canal to reinforce the badly damaged Pacific Fleet. The carrier's first combat operation was the Marshalls-Gilberts raid in early February 1942.  Yorktown  then steamed to the South Pacific, where she participated in a series of raids and other operations that climaxed in the Battle of Coral Sea in early May. In this action, in which she was damaged by enemy bombs, her planes attacked two Japanese aircraft carriers, helping to sink  Shoho  and damaging  Shokaku .    Quick repairs at Pearl Harbor put  Yorktown  into good enough condition to participate in the Battle of Midway on 4-6 June 1942. During this great turning point of the Pacific War, her air group fatally damaged the Japanese aircraft carrier  Soryu  and shared in the destruction of the carrier  Hiryu  and cruiser  Mikuma . However, successive strikes by dive bombers and torpedo planes from  Hiryu  seriously damaged  Yorktown , causing her abandonment during the afternoon of 4 June. Two days later, while salvage efforts were underway, the Japanese submarine  I-168  torpedoed both the damaged carrier and the destroyer  Hammann  (DD-412), sinking the latter immediately and  Yorktown  shortly after daybreak on 7 June 1942. USS  Yorktown 's wreck was discovered and examined in May 1998, in surprisingly good condition after fifty-six years beneath more than three miles of sea water.

USS  Yorktown  (CV/CVA/CVS-10)  is one of 24  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  built during  World War II  for the  United States Navy . She is named after the  Battle of Yorktown  of the  American Revolutionary War , and is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Initially to have been named  Bon Homme Richard , she was renamed  Yorktown  while under construction to commemorate  USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) , lost at the  Battle of Midway  in June 1942.  Yorktown  was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the  Pacific Theater of Operations , earning 11  battle stars  and the  Presidential Unit Citation .   Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the  Korean War  but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the  Vietnam War , in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career she was used in the movie  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor , and also served as a recovery ship for the  Apollo 8  space mission.   Yorktown  was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a  museum ship  at  Patriot's Point ,  Mount Pleasant, South Carolina . She is a  National Historic Landmark .

She was renamed on 26 September 1942, and launched on 21 January 1943, sponsored by  Eleanor Roosevelt .  Yorktown  was  commissioned  on 15 April 1943. with  Captain   Joseph J. Clark  in command.     [ edit ]   Service History     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   1943   Yorktown  remained in the  Naval Station Norfolk  area until 21 May, at which time she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of  Trinidad . She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited  Chesapeake Bay  on her way to the  Pacific Ocean . She transited the  Panama Canal  on 11 July and departed  Balboa, Panama , on 12 July. The warship arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the  Hawaiian Islands . On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her  task force , TF 15, arrived at the launching point about 128 miles (206 km) from  Marcus Island  early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.   On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the  West Coast of the United States . She arrived in  San Francisco  on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor.  Yorktown  returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on  Japanese  installations on  Wake Island . After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii.  Yorktown  arrived at  Oahu  on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.   On 10 November,  Yorktown  departed Pearl Harbor in company with  Task Force 50 the  Fast Carrier Task Force ,  Pacific Fleet to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of certain of the  Gilbert Islands . On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near  Jaluit  and  Mili  and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on  Tarawa ,  Abemama , and  Makin . The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at  Wotje  and  Kwajalein  Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.     [ edit ]   1944   On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault Operation Flintlock , the  Marshall Islands  invasion. Her task group,  Task Group 58.1 , arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, and its carriers Yorktown ,  Lexington , and  Cowpens began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on  Maloelap  Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on  Majuro  and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January,  Yorktown  and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January,  Yorktown  aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the Yorktown air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.   Over the next four months,  Yorktown  participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the  Marianas  in the north to  New Guinea  in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at  Truk  Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16 February and 17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas and, on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on  Saipan . That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for  Espiritu Santo  in the  New Hebrides . She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30 March and 31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the  Palau Islands ; and, on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of  Woleai . Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.   On 13 April,  Yorktown  returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of  Major General   Douglas MacArthur 's assault on the  Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)  area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the  Wakde - Sarmi  area of northern New Guinea. On 22 April and 23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 April and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May and, for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific.  Yorktown  entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operationthe assault on the Marianas.   On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan.  Yorktown  aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on  Guam . Those raids continued until 13 June, when  Yorktown , with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the  Bonin Islands . That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the  Battle of the Philippine Sea . Task Force 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.   On the morning of 19 June,  Yorktown  aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large  bogey  appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle,  Yorktown {'}s planes continued both to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea,  Yorktown  aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.           Yorktown  in June 1944 with planes of  Carrier Air Group 1       On the morning of 20 June,  Yorktown  steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from  Hornet  spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units.  Yorktown  launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral  Ozawa 's force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after  Zuikaku  on whom they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the  Yorktown  air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese.  Yorktown  returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on  Pagan Island  on 22 June and 23 June. On 24 June, she launched another series of raids on  Iwo Jima . On 25 June, she laid in a course for  Eniwetok  and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3 July and 4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and  Chichi Jima . On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on  Yap ,  Ulithi , and the  Palaus . She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.   On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headedvia Eniwetok and Pearl Harborback to the United States.  Yorktown  arrived in the  Puget Sound Navy Yard  on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the  Alameda Naval Air Station  from 11 October to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 October to 24 October,  Yorktown  arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.   On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the  Philippines  in support of the  Leyte  invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November,  Yorktown  arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of  Luzon  in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous  typhoon  of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers Spence ,  Hull , and  Monaghan and  Yorktown  participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.     [ edit ]   1945   Yorktown  fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in  Formosa  and the Philippines in support of the landings at  Lingayen . The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January 1945 on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January,  Yorktown  and the rest of TF 38 entered the  South China Sea  via  Bashi Channel  to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of  Saigon  and  Tourane Bay ,  Indochina , in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional [ citation needed ]  score44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and  Canton  in  China . The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again also went to  Hong Kong . On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via  Balintang Channel . She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on  Okinawa  on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.   Yorktown  remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the  3rd Fleet  becoming the  5th Fleet  when  Spruance  relieved  Halsey , on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the  Tokyo  area of  Honsh . On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and  Yorktown  aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time  Yorktown  cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February,  Yorktown  aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on  Kysh  before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.   She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kysh, Honsh, and  Shikoku .   The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine  bomber , probably a  Yokosuka P1Y  ""Frances"", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over  Yorktown' s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime,  Yorktown  continued air operations. That afternoon, three  Yokosuka D4Y  ""Judy""  dive-bombers  launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26.  Yorktown , however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.   On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kysh. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single ""Judy"" made an apparent suicide dive on  Yorktown . The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about 60 feet (18 m) from (20 m) portside.   On 30 March,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive  battleship   Yamato  was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive.  Yorktown  and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target.  Air Group 9  aviators claimed several torpedo hits on  Yamato  just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three 500 pound bomb hits on  light cruiser   Yahagi  sunk it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action,  Yorktown  and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her.  Yorktown' s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the  Rykys , but  Yorktown  sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   Yorktown  entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6 June and 7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kysh airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on  Minami Daito Shima . After the second day's strikes,  Yorktown  began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in  San Pedro Bay  at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honsh. After a fueling rendezvous on 11 June and 12 June, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island  Hokkaid . Those strikes lasted from 13 June to 15 June. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 June, at which time her aviators returned to the Tokyo area. From 19 June to 22 June, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 June, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the  Kure  naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 June, and on 27 June and 28 June, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29 June and 30 June, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8 August and 9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honsh and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 August and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and, on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.   From 16 August to 23 August,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honsh where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender on board battleship  Missouri  on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied  prisoners of war  still living in their prison camps. On 16 September,  Yorktown  entered  Tokyo Bay  with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in  Buckner Bay  on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.     [ edit ]   1945  1952          Mothballed  Yorktown  at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1948       After a non-stop voyage,  Yorktown  entered  San Francisco Bay  on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to  Hunters Point Navy Yard  to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in  Apra Harbor  on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to  Samar  in the Philippines, she was diverted to  Manila  en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to  Bremerton, Washington , where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947,  Yorktown  was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Bremerton Group,  Pacific Reserve Fleet .     [ edit ]   1953  1955           Yorktown  after the SCB-27A conversion in 1953       Yorktown  remained in reserve for almost five years. In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at  Puget Sound . On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953,  Yorktown  was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain  William M. Nation  in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in  Yokosuka , Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the  Sea of Japan . The  Korean War  armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,  Yorktown  put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the  Academy Award  nominated short subject documentary film  Jet Carrier . She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 July to 28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.   Yorktown  operated out of the Manila- Subic Bay  area, conducting  7th Fleet  maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the  Christmas  holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of  Nationalist Chinese  from the  Tachen Islands  located near the communist-controlled mainland.  Yorktown  entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23 February and 24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. On 21 March 1955, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at the  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  where she was to receive extensive modificationsmost significantly, an angled  flight deck  to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall and, on 14 October, was placed back in full commission.     [ edit ]   1955  1957   The carrier resumed normal operations along the west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953.  Yorktown  stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the  East China Sea , and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as  Sasebo , Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December.  Yorktown  resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.     [ edit ]   1957  1960   On 1 September 1957, her home port was changed from Alameda to  Long Beach, California , and she was reclassified an  antisubmarine warfare  (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation  CVS-10 . On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at  Bangor, Washington , on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months,  Yorktown  conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 November to 17 November,  Yorktown  continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands,  Quemoy  and  Matsu , held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off  Vietnam  during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the  Taiwan Strait . The remainder of the deploymentsave for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in Marchconsisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at  San Diego  on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.   In January 1960,  Yorktown  headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.     [ edit ]   1961  1964   Yorktown  emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for the Far East. During that deployment, she served as  flagship  for  Carrier Division 19 . She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the  SEATO  ASW exercise,  Operation Sea Serpent . The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.   Yorktown  arrived back in her home port on 18 June and resumed normal operations for the remainder of the year. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.     [ edit ]   1965  1968   The 1964 and 1965 deployment brought  Yorktown  her first real involvement in the  Vietnamese civil war . In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnampresumably ASW services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.   For the remainder of her active career,  Yorktown' s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka on 17 February and joined TF 77 on  Yankee Station  later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing ASW and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several ASW exercises, including the major SEATO exercise,  Operation Sea Imp . The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, headed home on 15 July. She disembarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operationscarrier qualifications and ASW exercisesfor the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.   On 24 February 1967,  Yorktown  entered the  Long Beach Naval Shipyard  for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover  Yorktown  headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled in the wake of the  North Korean  capture of  Pueblo . She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo Japan where she stopped from 19 June to 21 June before heading back to the United States.     [ edit ]   1968  1975          The  Apollo 8  Command Module on the deck of the USS  Yorktown       Yorktown  arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie,  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor . In December 1968, she served as one of the  recovery ships  for the  Apollo 8  space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the  West Indies  until late summer. On 2 September,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise  Operation Peacekeeper . During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and  Yorktown  began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to  Brest, France , and  Rotterdam  in the  Netherlands ,  Yorktown  put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises between 18 October and 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at  Kiel ,  Germany . After that, she stopped at  Copenhagen ,  Denmark , and at  Portsmouth ,  England , before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.   During the first half of 1970,  Yorktown  operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970,  Yorktown  was decommissioned at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group,  Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the  Navy List  on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the  Navy Department  approved the donation of  Yorktown  to the  Patriot's Point Development Authority ,  Charleston, South Carolina . She was towed from  Bayonne, New Jersey , to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

NS0573904   44k   Samuel Adams was born at Northampton, Massachusetts, on 10 April 1912.  Graduated from  the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935, he was designated a Naval Aviator in January 1939.  He joined Bombing  Squadron Five (VB-5) on USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) in May 1939 and served with that unit through  the first six months of the Pacific war.  On 4 June 1942, during a Battle of Midway scouting flight,  Lieutenant Adams located the Japanese aircraft carrier  Hiryu , a vital contribution to the destruction  of that ship.  On the following day, while attacking the Japanese destroyer  Tanikaze , he lost  his life when his SBD aircraft was shot down.  Lieutenant Samuel Adams was posthumously awarded the  Navy Cross for his actions during the Battle of Midway.

Under construction as Bon Homme Richard, this new Essex-class carrier was renames Yorktown in honor of Yorktown (CV-5), sunk at the epic Battle of Midway (June 1942).  Built in an amazing 16 months at Newport News, Virginia, Yorktown  was commissioned on April 15, 1943.  Yorktown participated significantly in the Pacific Offensive that began in late 1943 and ended with the defeat of Japan in 1945.  Yorktown received the Presidential Unit Citation and earned 11 battle stars for service in World War II.  Much of the Academy Award-winning (1944) documentary ""The Fighting Lady"" was filmed aboard Yorktown.               In the 1950, Yorktown was modified with the addition of and angled deck to better operate jet aircraft in her role as an attack carrier (CVA).  In 1958, Yorktown was designated an anti-submarine aircraft carrier (CVS), and would later earn 5 battle stars for service off Vietnam (1965-1968).  The ship also recovered the Apollo 8 astronauts and capsule (December 1968).  Yorktown was decommissioned in 1970 and placed in reserve.               In 1975, Yorktown was towed from Bayonne, NJ to Charleston to become the centerpiece of Patriots Point Naval and Maritime Museum.

The battle was the most significant Union defeat in the  Western Theater  of the  American Civil War .   The battle was fought between the Union  Army of the Cumberland  under  Maj. Gen.   William Rosecrans  and the  Confederate   Army of Tennessee  under  Gen.   Braxton Bragg , and was named for West Chickamauga Creek, which flows into the  Tennessee River  about 3.5 miles (5.6 km) northeast of downtown  Chattanooga .   After his successful  Tullahoma Campaign , Rosecrans renewed the offensive, aiming to force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. The three corps comprising Rosecrans's army set out for Chattanooga by separate routes. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg's army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops followed it and brushed with it at  Davis's Cross Roads . Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans's army, defeat it, and then move back into the city. On September 17 he headed north, intending to attack the isolated  XXI Corps . As Bragg marched north on September 18, his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry, which were armed with  Spencer repeating rifles .   Fighting began in earnest on the morning of September 19, and Bragg's men strongly assaulted but did not break the Union line. The next day, Bragg continued his assault on the Union line, and in late morning, Rosecrans was informed that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore up the supposed gap, Rosecrans created an actual gap, and Confederate  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet 's men promptly exploited it, driving one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans himself, from the field. Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  took over command and began consolidating forces on Horseshoe Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Although the Confederates launched determined assaults on Thomas and his men, they held until after dark. The Union retired to Chattanooga while the Confederates occupied the surrounding heights, besieging the city.

[ 5 ]  General-in-chief Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck  and  President   Abraham Lincoln  were insistent that Rosecrans move quickly to take Chattanooga. Seizing the city would open the door for the Union to advance toward  Atlanta  and the heartland of the  South . Chattanooga was a vital rail hub (with lines going north toward  Nashville  and  Knoxville  and south toward Atlanta), and an important manufacturing center for the production of iron and coke, located on the navigable Tennessee River. Situated between  Lookout Mountain ,  Missionary Ridge , Raccoon Mountain, and Stringer's Ridge, Chattanooga occupied an important, defensible position. [ 6 ]   Although Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee contained about 52,000 men at the end of July, the Confederate government merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner , into Bragg's Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg's army, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the  Knoxville  area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg's command who had little or no respect for the commanding general. [ 7 ]  Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  and Maj. Gen.  William J. Hardee  had already made their animosity well known. Buckner's attitude was colored by Bragg's unsuccessful invasion of Buckner's native Kentucky in 1862, as well as by the loss of his command through the merger. [ 8 ]  A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee's request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill , a general who did not get along with  Robert E. Lee  in Virginia. [ 9 ]  The Confederate War Department asked Bragg in early August if he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements for Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. [ 10 ]  He was also concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen.  Ambrose E. Burnside  that was threatening Knoxville. Bragg withdrew his forces from advanced positions around  Bridgeport , which left Rosecrans free to maneuver on the northern side of the Tennessee River. He concentrated his two infantry corps around Chattanooga and relied upon cavalry to cover his flanks, extending from northern  Alabama  to near Knoxville. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   River of Death   The campaign and major battle take their name from West Chickamauga Creek. In popular histories, it is often said that Chickamauga is a  Cherokee  word meaning ""river of death"". [ 12 ]  Peter Cozzens, who has written arguably the most definitive book on the battle,  This Terrible Sound , wrote that this is the ""loose translation"". [ 13 ]  Glenn Tucker presents the translations of ""stagnant water"" (from the ""lower Cherokee tongue""), ""good country"" (from the  Chickasaw ) and, ""river of death"" (dialect of the ""upcountry Cherokee""). Tucker claims that the ""river of death"" came by its name not from early warfare, but from the location that the Cherokee contracted smallpox. [ 14 ]  James Mooney, in  Myths of the Cherokee , wrote that Chickamauga is the more common spelling for  Tskma'g , a name that has ""lost any meaning in Cherokee and appears to be of foreign origin."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Opposing forces     Further information:  Confederate order of battle , and  Union order of battle            Commanding generals Rosecrans and Bragg       The Union  Army of the Cumberland , commanded by Rosecrans, consisted of about 60,000 men, [ 2 ]  composed of the following major organizations: [ 16 ]     XIV Corps , commanded by Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas , 22,781 present for duty with division commanders Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird , Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley , Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan , and Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds .

Van Cleve .   Reserve Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger , 7,372 present with one division commanded by Brig. Gen.  James B. Steedman  and an attached brigade of Col.  Daniel McCook .   Cavalry Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Robert B. Mitchell , [ 17 ]  10,078 present with division commanders Brig. Gen.  George Crook , and Col.  Edward M. McCook .     The Confederate  Army of Tennessee , commanded by Bragg, with about 65,000 men, [ 3 ]  was composed of the following major organizations: [ 18 ]     The Right Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham , Hill's Corps of Lt. Gen.  D.H. Hill  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Patrick R. Cleburne  and  John C. Breckinridge ) and the Reserve Corps of Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  (divisions of Brig. Gen.  States Rights Gist  and  St. John R. Liddell ).   The Left Wing, commanded by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , contained the division of Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman , Buckner's Corps of Maj. Gen.  Simon B. Buckner  (divisions of Maj. Gen.  Alexander P. Stewart  and Brig. Gens.  William Preston  and  Bushrod R. Johnson ) and Longstreet's Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  John Bell Hood  (divisions of Maj. Gens.  Lafayette McLaws  and Hood).   A cavalry corps, commanded by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Wheeler , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  John A. Wharton  and  William T. Martin .   A second cavalry corps, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest , contained the divisions of Brig. Gens.  Frank C. Armstrong  and  John Pegram .     The organization of the Army of Tennessee into Wings was ordered the night of September 19 upon the arrival of Longstreet from Virginia. Prior to this, the corps commanders reported directly to Bragg. [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign          Initial movements in the Chickamauga Campaign, August 15  September 8, 1863.        Confederate         Union         [ edit ]   Planning the Union advance   Rosecrans faced significant logistical challenges if he chose to move forward. The Cumberland Plateau that separated the armies was a rugged, barren country over 30 miles long with poor roads and little opportunity for foraging. If Bragg attacked him during the advance, Rosecrans would be forced to fight with his back against the mountains and tenuous supply lines. He did not have the luxury of staying put, however, because he was under intense pressure from Washington to move forward in conjunction with Burnside's advance into East Tennessee. By early August, Halleck was frustrated enough with Rosecrans's delay that he ordered him to move forward immediately and to report daily the movement of each corps until he crossed the Tennessee River. Rosecrans was outraged at the tone of ""recklessness, conceit and malice"" of Halleck's order and insisted that he would be courting disaster if he were not permitted to delay his advance until the least August 17. [ 20 ]   Rosecrans knew that he would have difficulty receiving supplies from his base on any advance across the Tennessee River and therefore thought it necessary to accumulate enough supplies and transport wagons that he could cross long distances without a reliable line of communications. His subordinate generals were supportive of this line of reasoning and counseled delay, all except for Brig. Gen.  James A. Garfield , Rosecrans's chief of staff, a politician who understood the value of being on the record endorsing the Lincoln administration's priorities. [ 21 ]   The plan for the Union advance was to cross the Cumberland Plateau into the valley of the Tennessee River, pause briefly to accumulate some supplies, and then cross the river itself. An opposed crossing of the wide river was not feasible, so Rosecrans devised a deception to distract Bragg above Chattanooga while the army crossed downstream. Then the Army would advance on a wide front through the mountains. The  XXI Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden  would advance against the city from the west, the  XIV Corps  under Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas  would cross over Lookout Mountain 20 miles south of the city, while the  XX Corps  under Maj. Gen.  Alexander M. McCook  and the Cavalry Corps under Maj. Gen.  David S. Stanley  would advance even farther to the southeast toward Bragg's railroad supply line leading from Atlanta. If executed correctly, this plan would cause Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga or be trapped in the city without supplies. [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Crossing the Tennessee   Rosecrans ordered his army to move on August 16. The difficult road conditions meant a full week passed before they reached the Tennessee River Valley. They encamped while engineers made preparations for crossing the river. Meanwhile, Rosecrans's deception plan was underway.  Col.   John T. Wilder  of the  XIV Corps  moved his mounted infantry brigade (the Lightning Brigade, which first saw prominence at  Hoover's Gap ) to the north of Chattanooga. His men pounded on tubs and sawed boards, sending pieces of wood downstream, to make the Confederates think that rafts were being constructed for a crossing north of the city. His artillery, commanded by Capt.  Eli Lilly , bombarded the city from Stringer's Ridge for two weeks, an operation sometimes known as the  Second Battle of Chattanooga . The deception worked and Bragg was convinced that the Union crossing would be above the city, in conjunction with Burnside's advancing  Army of the Ohio  from Knoxville. [ 23 ]   The first crossing of the Tennessee River was accomplished by the XX Corps at Caperton's Ferry, 4 miles from  Stevenson  on August 29, where construction began on a 1,250-foot pontoon bridge. The second crossing, of the XIV Corps, was at  Shellmound, Tennessee , on August 30. They were quickly followed by most of the XXI Corps. The fourth crossing site was at the mouth of  Battle Creek, Tennessee , where the rest of the XIV Corps crossed on August 31. Without permanent bridges, the Army of the Cumberland could not be supplied reliably, so another bridge was constructed at Bridgeport by Maj. Gen.  Philip Sheridan 's division, spanning 2,700 feet in three days. Virtually all of the Union army, other than elements of the Reserve Corps kept behind to guard the railroad, had safely crossed the river by September 4. They faced more mountainous terrain and road networks that were just as treacherous as the ones they had already traversed. [ 24 ]   The Confederate high command was concerned about this development and took steps to reinforce the Army of Tennessee. General  Joseph E. Johnston 's army dispatched on loan two weak divisions (about 9,000 men) from  Mississippi  under Maj. Gen.  John C. Breckinridge  and Maj. Gen.  William H. T. Walker  by September 4, and General  Robert E. Lee  dispatched a corps under  Lt. Gen.   James Longstreet  from the  Army of Northern Virginia . Only two divisions of Virginians reached Bragg, of which only five brigades (about 5,000 effectives) arrived in time for the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga on September 20. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Into Georgia   The three infantry corps of Rosecrans's army advanced by separate routes, on the only three roads that were suitable for such movements. On the right flank, McCook's XX Corps moved southwest to  Valley Head, Alabama ; in the center, Thomas's XIV Corps moved just across the border to  Trenton, Georgia ; and on the left, Crittenden's XXI Corps moved directly toward Chattanooga around Lookout Mountain. On September 8, after learning that Rosecrans had crossed into his rear, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga and moved his army south along the LaFayette Road toward  LaFayette, Georgia . The Union army occupied Chattanooga on September 9. Rosecrans telegraphed Halleck, ""Chattanooga is ours without a struggle and East Tennessee is free."" [ 26 ]  Bragg was aware of Rosecrans's dispositions and planned to defeat him by attacking his isolated corps individually. The corps were spread out over 40 miles (65 km), too far apart to support each other. [ 27 ]          Davis's Cross Roads, September 11, 1863.       Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and fleeing to either  Dalton ,  Rome , or  Atlanta, Georgia . Instead, Bragg's Army of Tennessee was encamped at LaFayette, some 20 miles (32 km) south of Chattanooga. Confederate soldiers who posed as deserters deliberately added to this impression. Thomas firmly cautioned Rosecrans that a pursuit of Bragg was unwise because the Army of the Cumberland was too widely dispersed and its supply lines were tenuous. Rosecrans, exultant at his success in capturing Chattanooga, discounted Thomas's advice. He ordered McCook to swing across Lookout Mountain at Winston's Gap and use his cavalry to break Bragg's railroad supply line at  Resaca, Georgia . Crittenden was to take Chattanooga and then turn south in pursuit of Bragg. Thomas was to continue his advance toward LaFayette. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Davis's Cross Roads   Thomas's lead division, under Maj. Gen.  James Negley , intended to cross McLemore's Cove and use Dug Gap in Pigeon Mountain to reach LaFayette. Negley was 12 hours ahead of Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird 's division, the nearest reinforcements. Braxton Bragg hoped to trap Negley by attacking through the cove from the northeast, forcing the Union division to its destruction at the cul-de-sac at the southwest end of the valley. Early on the morning of September 10, Bragg ordered Polk's division under Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman  to march 13 miles southwest into the cove and strike Negley's flank. He also ordered D.H. Hill to send Cleburne's division from LaFayette through Dug Gap to strike Negley's front, making sure the movement was coordinated with Hindman's. [ 29 ]   Entering the cove with 4,600 men, Negley's division encountered Confederate skirmishers, but pressed forward to Davis's Cross Roads. Informed that there was a large Confederate force approaching on his left, Negley took up a position in the mouth of the cove and remained there until 3 a.m. on September 11. Hill claimed that Bragg's orders reached him very late and began offering excuses for why he could not advanceCleburne was sick in bed and the road through Dug Gap was obstructed by felled timber. He advised calling off the operation. Hindman, who had executed Bragg's orders promptly and had advanced to within 4 miles of Negley's division, became overly cautious when he realized that Hill would not be attacking on schedule and ordered his men to stop. Bragg reinforced Hindman with two divisions of Buckner's corps, which were encamped near Lee and Gordon's Mill. When Buckner reached Hindman at 5 p.m. on September 10, the Confederates outnumbered Negley's division 3 to 1, but failed to attack. [ 30 ]   Infuriated that his orders were being defied and a golden opportunity was being lost, Bragg issued new orders for Hindman to attack early September 11. Cleburne, who was not sick as Hill had claimed, cleared the felled timber from Dug Gap and prepared to advance when he heard the sound of Hindman's guns. By this time, however, Baird's division had reached Negley's, and Negley had withdrawn his division to a defensive position just east of the crossroads. The two Union divisions then withdrew to Stevens Gap. Hindman's men skirmished with Baird's rear guard, but could not prevent the withdrawal of the Union force. [ 31 ]     [ edit ]   Final maneuvers          Lee and Gordon's Mills.       Realizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and, as he wrote in his official report""as a matter of life and death""began to concentrate his scattered forces. [ 32 ]  On September 12 he ordered McCook and the cavalry to move northeast to Stevens Gap to join with Thomas, intending for this combined force to continue northeast to link up with Crittenden. The message to McCook took a full day to reach him at Alpine and the route he selected to move northeast required three days of marching 57 miles, retracing his steps over Lookout Mountain. [ 33 ]   Crittenden's corps began moving from Ringgold toward Lee and Gordon's Mill. Forests cavalry reported the movement across the Confederate front and Bragg saw another offensive opportunity. He ordered Lt. Gen.  Leonidas Polk  to attack Crittenden's lead division, under Brig. Gen.  Thomas J. Wood , at dawn on September 13, with Polk's corps and Walker's corps. Bragg rode to the scene after hearing no sound of battle and found that there were no preparations being made to attack. Once again, Bragg was angry that one of his subordinates did not attack as ordered, but by that morning it was too lateall of Crittenden's corps had passed by and concentrated at Lee and Gordon's Mill. [ 34 ]   For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. Bragg, learning of McCook's movement at Alpine, feared the Federals might be planning a double envelopment. At a council of war on September 15, Bragg's corps commanders agreed that an offensive in the direction of Chattanooga offered their best option. [ 35 ]   By September 17, McCook's corps had reached Stevens Gap and the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Yet Bragg decided that he still had an opportunity. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet , and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen.  Bushrod R. Johnson , he decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army out to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. The Confederate army was to move beyond the Federal left flank at Lee and Gordon's Mill and then cross West Chickamauga Creek. He specified four crossing points, from north to south: Johnson's division at Reed's Bridge, Walker's Reserve Corps at Alexander's Bridge, Buckner's corps at Thedford's Ford, and Polk's corps at Dalton's Ford. Hill's corps would anchor the army's left flank and the cavalry under Forrest and Wheeler would cover Bragg's right and left flanks, respectively. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Opening engagements: September 18          September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga.       Bushrod Johnson's division took the wrong road from Ringgold, but eventually headed west on the Reed's Bridge Road. At 7 a.m. his men encountered cavalry pickets from Col. Robert Minty's brigade, guarding the approach to Reed's Bridge. Being outnumbered five to one, Minty's men eventually withdrew across the bridge after being pressured by elements of Forrest's cavalry, but could not destroy the bridge in time to prevent Johnson's men from crossing. At 4:30 p.m., when Johnson had reached Jay's Mill, Maj. Gen.  John B. Hood  of Longstreet's Corps arrived from the railroad station at Catoosa and took command of the column. He ordered Johnson to use the Jay's Mill Road instead of the Brotherton Road, as Johnson had planned. [ 37 ]   At Alexander's Bridge to the south, Col.  John T. Wilder 's mounted infantry brigade defended the crossing against the approach of Walker's Corps. Armed with  Spencer repeating rifles  and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, Wilder was able to hold off a brigade of Brig. Gen.  St. John Liddell's  division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 4:30 p.m., considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew and establish a new blocking position east of the Lafayette Road, near the Viniard farm. [ 38 ]   By dark, Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. Buckner had been able to push only one brigade across the creek at Thedford's Ford. Polk's troops were facing Crittenden's at Lee and Gordon's Mill and D.H. Hill's corps guarded crossing sites to the south. [ 39 ]   Although Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area. [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Battle of Chickamauga     [ edit ]   September 19          Actions, morning of September 19.       Rosecrans's movement of Maj. Gen.  George H. Thomas 's XIV Corps the previous day put the left flank of the Army of the Cumberland farther north than Bragg expected to find when he formulated his plans for an attack on September 20. Maj. Gen.  Thomas L. Crittenden 's XXI Corps was concentrated around Lee and Gordon's Mill, which Bragg assumed was the left flank, but Thomas was arrayed behind him, covering a wide front from Crawfish Springs (division of Maj. Gen.  James S. Negley ), the Widow Glenn's house (Maj. Gen.  Joseph J. Reynolds ), Kelly field (Brig. Gen.  Absalom Baird ), to around the McDonald farm (Brig. Gen.  John M. Brannan ). Maj. Gen.  Gordon Granger 's Reserve Corps was spread along the northern end of the battlefield from Rossville to McAfee's Church. [ 41 ]   Bragg's plan was for an attack on the supposed Union left flank by the corps of Maj. Gens.  Simon B. Buckner ,  John Bell Hood , and  W.H.T. Walker , screened by Brig. Gen.  Nathan Bedford Forrest 's cavalry to the north, with Maj. Gen.  Benjamin F. Cheatham 's division held in reserve in the center and Maj. Gen.  Patrick R. Cleburne 's division in reserve at Thedford's Ford. Maj. Gen.  Thomas C. Hindman 's division faced Crittenden at Lee and Gordon's Mill and Breckinridge's faced Negley. [ 42 ]   The Battle of Chickamauga opened almost by accident, when pickets from Col.  Daniel McCook 's brigade of Granger's Reserve Corps moved toward Jay's Mill In search of water. McCook had moved from Rossville on September 18 to aid Col. Robert Minty's brigade. His men established a defensive position several hundred yards northwest of Jay's Mill, about equally distant from where the 1st Georgia Cavalry waited through the night south of the mill. At about the time that McCook sent a regiment to destroy Reed's Bridge (which would survive the second attempt in two days to destroy it), Brig. Gen. Henry Davidson of Forrest's Cavalry Corps sent the 1st Georgia forward and they encountered some of McCook's men near the mill. McCook was ordered by Granger to withdraw back to Rossville and his men were pursued by Davidson's troopers. McCook encountered Thomas at the LaFayette Road, having finished an all-night march from Crawfish Springs. McCook reported to Thomas that a single Confederate infantry brigade was trapped on the west side of Chickamauga Creek. Thomas ordered Brannan's division to attack and destroy it. <  "

USS  Yorktown  (CV/CVA/CVS-10)  is one of 24  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  built during  World War II  for the  United States Navy . She is named after the  Battle of Yorktown  of the  American Revolutionary War , and is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Initially to have been named  Bon Homme Richard , she was renamed  Yorktown  while under construction to commemorate  USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) , lost at the  Battle of Midway  in June 1942.  Yorktown  was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the  Pacific Theater of Operations , earning 11  battle stars  and the  Presidential Unit Citation .   Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the  Korean War  but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the  Vietnam War , in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career she was used in the movie  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor , and also served as a recovery ship for the  Apollo 8  space mission.   Yorktown  was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a  museum ship  at  Patriot's Point ,  Mount Pleasant, South Carolina . She is a  National Historic Landmark .

She was renamed on 26 September 1942, and launched on 21 January 1943, sponsored by  Eleanor Roosevelt .  Yorktown  was  commissioned  on 15 April 1943. with  Captain   Joseph J. Clark  in command.     [ edit ]   Service History     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   1943   Yorktown  remained in the  Naval Station Norfolk  area until 21 May, at which time she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of  Trinidad . She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited  Chesapeake Bay  on her way to the  Pacific Ocean . She transited the  Panama Canal  on 11 July and departed  Balboa, Panama , on 12 July. The warship arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the  Hawaiian Islands . On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her  task force , TF 15, arrived at the launching point about 128 miles (206 km) from  Marcus Island  early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.   On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the  West Coast of the United States . She arrived in  San Francisco  on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor.  Yorktown  returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on  Japanese  installations on  Wake Island . After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii.  Yorktown  arrived at  Oahu  on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.   On 10 November,  Yorktown  departed Pearl Harbor in company with  Task Force 50 the  Fast Carrier Task Force ,  Pacific Fleet to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of certain of the  Gilbert Islands . On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near  Jaluit  and  Mili  and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on  Tarawa ,  Abemama , and  Makin . The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at  Wotje  and  Kwajalein  Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.     [ edit ]   1944   On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault Operation Flintlock , the  Marshall Islands  invasion. Her task group,  Task Group 58.1 , arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, and its carriers Yorktown ,  Lexington , and  Cowpens began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on  Maloelap  Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on  Majuro  and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January,  Yorktown  and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January,  Yorktown  aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the Yorktown air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.   Over the next four months,  Yorktown  participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the  Marianas  in the north to  New Guinea  in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at  Truk  Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16 February and 17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas and, on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on  Saipan . That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for  Espiritu Santo  in the  New Hebrides . She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30 March and 31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the  Palau Islands ; and, on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of  Woleai . Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.   On 13 April,  Yorktown  returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of  Major General   Douglas MacArthur 's assault on the  Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)  area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the  Wakde - Sarmi  area of northern New Guinea. On 22 April and 23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 April and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May and, for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific.  Yorktown  entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operationthe assault on the Marianas.   On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan.  Yorktown  aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on  Guam . Those raids continued until 13 June, when  Yorktown , with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the  Bonin Islands . That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the  Battle of the Philippine Sea . Task Force 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.   On the morning of 19 June,  Yorktown  aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large  bogey  appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle,  Yorktown {'}s planes continued both to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea,  Yorktown  aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.           Yorktown  in June 1944 with planes of  Carrier Air Group 1       On the morning of 20 June,  Yorktown  steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from  Hornet  spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units.  Yorktown  launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral  Ozawa 's force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after  Zuikaku  on whom they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the  Yorktown  air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese.  Yorktown  returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on  Pagan Island  on 22 June and 23 June. On 24 June, she launched another series of raids on  Iwo Jima . On 25 June, she laid in a course for  Eniwetok  and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3 July and 4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and  Chichi Jima . On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on  Yap ,  Ulithi , and the  Palaus . She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.   On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headedvia Eniwetok and Pearl Harborback to the United States.  Yorktown  arrived in the  Puget Sound Navy Yard  on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the  Alameda Naval Air Station  from 11 October to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 October to 24 October,  Yorktown  arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.   On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the  Philippines  in support of the  Leyte  invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November,  Yorktown  arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of  Luzon  in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous  typhoon  of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers Spence ,  Hull , and  Monaghan and  Yorktown  participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.     [ edit ]   1945   Yorktown  fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in  Formosa  and the Philippines in support of the landings at  Lingayen . The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January 1945 on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January,  Yorktown  and the rest of TF 38 entered the  South China Sea  via  Bashi Channel  to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of  Saigon  and  Tourane Bay ,  Indochina , in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional [ citation needed ]  score44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and  Canton  in  China . The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again also went to  Hong Kong . On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via  Balintang Channel . She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on  Okinawa  on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.   Yorktown  remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the  3rd Fleet  becoming the  5th Fleet  when  Spruance  relieved  Halsey , on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the  Tokyo  area of  Honsh . On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and  Yorktown  aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time  Yorktown  cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February,  Yorktown  aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on  Kysh  before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.   She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kysh, Honsh, and  Shikoku .   The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine  bomber , probably a  Yokosuka P1Y  ""Frances"", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over  Yorktown' s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime,  Yorktown  continued air operations. That afternoon, three  Yokosuka D4Y  ""Judy""  dive-bombers  launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26.  Yorktown , however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.   On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kysh. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single ""Judy"" made an apparent suicide dive on  Yorktown . The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about 60 feet (18 m) from (20 m) portside.   On 30 March,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive  battleship   Yamato  was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive.  Yorktown  and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target.  Air Group 9  aviators claimed several torpedo hits on  Yamato  just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three 500 pound bomb hits on  light cruiser   Yahagi  sunk it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action,  Yorktown  and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her.  Yorktown' s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the  Rykys , but  Yorktown  sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   Yorktown  entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6 June and 7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kysh airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on  Minami Daito Shima . After the second day's strikes,  Yorktown  began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in  San Pedro Bay  at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honsh. After a fueling rendezvous on 11 June and 12 June, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island  Hokkaid . Those strikes lasted from 13 June to 15 June. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 June, at which time her aviators returned to the Tokyo area. From 19 June to 22 June, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 June, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the  Kure  naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 June, and on 27 June and 28 June, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29 June and 30 June, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8 August and 9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honsh and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 August and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and, on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.   From 16 August to 23 August,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honsh where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender on board battleship  Missouri  on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied  prisoners of war  still living in their prison camps. On 16 September,  Yorktown  entered  Tokyo Bay  with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in  Buckner Bay  on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.     [ edit ]   1945  1952          Mothballed  Yorktown  at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1948       After a non-stop voyage,  Yorktown  entered  San Francisco Bay  on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to  Hunters Point Navy Yard  to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in  Apra Harbor  on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to  Samar  in the Philippines, she was diverted to  Manila  en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to  Bremerton, Washington , where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947,  Yorktown  was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Bremerton Group,  Pacific Reserve Fleet .     [ edit ]   1953  1955           Yorktown  after the SCB-27A conversion in 1953       Yorktown  remained in reserve for almost five years. In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at  Puget Sound . On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953,  Yorktown  was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain  William M. Nation  in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in  Yokosuka , Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the  Sea of Japan . The  Korean War  armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,  Yorktown  put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the  Academy Award  nominated short subject documentary film  Jet Carrier . She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 July to 28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.   Yorktown  operated out of the Manila- Subic Bay  area, conducting  7th Fleet  maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the  Christmas  holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of  Nationalist Chinese  from the  Tachen Islands  located near the communist-controlled mainland.  Yorktown  entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23 February and 24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. On 21 March 1955, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at the  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  where she was to receive extensive modificationsmost significantly, an angled  flight deck  to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall and, on 14 October, was placed back in full commission.     [ edit ]   1955  1957   The carrier resumed normal operations along the west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953.  Yorktown  stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the  East China Sea , and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as  Sasebo , Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December.  Yorktown  resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.     [ edit ]   1957  1960   On 1 September 1957, her home port was changed from Alameda to  Long Beach, California , and she was reclassified an  antisubmarine warfare  (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation  CVS-10 . On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at  Bangor, Washington , on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months,  Yorktown  conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 November to 17 November,  Yorktown  continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands,  Quemoy  and  Matsu , held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off  Vietnam  during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the  Taiwan Strait . The remainder of the deploymentsave for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in Marchconsisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at  San Diego  on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.   In January 1960,  Yorktown  headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.     [ edit ]   1961  1964   Yorktown  emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for the Far East. During that deployment, she served as  flagship  for  Carrier Division 19 . She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the  SEATO  ASW exercise,  Operation Sea Serpent . The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.   Yorktown  arrived back in her home port on 18 June and resumed normal operations for the remainder of the year. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.     [ edit ]   1965  1968   The 1964 and 1965 deployment brought  Yorktown  her first real involvement in the  Vietnamese civil war . In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnampresumably ASW services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.   For the remainder of her active career,  Yorktown' s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka on 17 February and joined TF 77 on  Yankee Station  later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing ASW and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several ASW exercises, including the major SEATO exercise,  Operation Sea Imp . The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, headed home on 15 July. She disembarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operationscarrier qualifications and ASW exercisesfor the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.   On 24 February 1967,  Yorktown  entered the  Long Beach Naval Shipyard  for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover  Yorktown  headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled in the wake of the  North Korean  capture of  Pueblo . She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo Japan where she stopped from 19 June to 21 June before heading back to the United States.     [ edit ]   1968  1975          The  Apollo 8  Command Module on the deck of the USS  Yorktown       Yorktown  arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie,  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor . In December 1968, she served as one of the  recovery ships  for the  Apollo 8  space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the  West Indies  until late summer. On 2 September,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise  Operation Peacekeeper . During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and  Yorktown  began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to  Brest, France , and  Rotterdam  in the  Netherlands ,  Yorktown  put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises between 18 October and 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at  Kiel ,  Germany . After that, she stopped at  Copenhagen ,  Denmark , and at  Portsmouth ,  England , before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.   During the first half of 1970,  Yorktown  operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970,  Yorktown  was decommissioned at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group,  Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the  Navy List  on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the  Navy Department  approved the donation of  Yorktown  to the  Patriot's Point Development Authority ,  Charleston, South Carolina . She was towed from  Bayonne, New Jersey , to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

USS  Yorktown  (CV/CVA/CVS-10)  is one of 24  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  built during  World War II  for the  United States Navy . She is named after the  Battle of Yorktown  of the  American Revolutionary War , and is the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Initially to have been named  Bon Homme Richard , she was renamed  Yorktown  while under construction to commemorate  USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) , lost at the  Battle of Midway  in June 1942.  Yorktown  was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the  Pacific Theater of Operations , earning 11  battle stars  and the  Presidential Unit Citation .   Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the  Korean War  but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the  Vietnam War , in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career she was used in the movie  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor , and also served as a recovery ship for the  Apollo 8  space mission.   Yorktown  was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a  museum ship  at  Patriot's Point ,  Mount Pleasant, South Carolina . She is a  National Historic Landmark .

[ edit ]   Service History     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   1943   Yorktown  remained in the  Naval Station Norfolk  area until 21 May, at which time she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of  Trinidad . She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited  Chesapeake Bay  on her way to the  Pacific Ocean . She transited the  Panama Canal  on 11 July and departed  Balboa, Panama , on 12 July. The warship arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the  Hawaiian Islands . On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her  task force , TF 15, arrived at the launching point about 128 miles (206 km) from  Marcus Island  early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.   On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the  West Coast of the United States . She arrived in  San Francisco  on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor.  Yorktown  returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on  Japanese  installations on  Wake Island . After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii.  Yorktown  arrived at  Oahu  on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.   On 10 November,  Yorktown  departed Pearl Harbor in company with  Task Force 50 the  Fast Carrier Task Force ,  Pacific Fleet to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of certain of the  Gilbert Islands . On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near  Jaluit  and  Mili  and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on  Tarawa ,  Abemama , and  Makin . The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at  Wotje  and  Kwajalein  Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.     [ edit ]   1944   On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault Operation Flintlock , the  Marshall Islands  invasion. Her task group,  Task Group 58.1 , arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, and its carriers Yorktown ,  Lexington , and  Cowpens began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on  Maloelap  Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on  Majuro  and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January,  Yorktown  and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January,  Yorktown  aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the Yorktown air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.   Over the next four months,  Yorktown  participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the  Marianas  in the north to  New Guinea  in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at  Truk  Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16 February and 17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas and, on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on  Saipan . That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for  Espiritu Santo  in the  New Hebrides . She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30 March and 31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the  Palau Islands ; and, on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of  Woleai . Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.   On 13 April,  Yorktown  returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of  Major General   Douglas MacArthur 's assault on the  Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)  area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the  Wakde - Sarmi  area of northern New Guinea. On 22 April and 23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 April and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May and, for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific.  Yorktown  entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operationthe assault on the Marianas.   On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan.  Yorktown  aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on  Guam . Those raids continued until 13 June, when  Yorktown , with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the  Bonin Islands . That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the  Battle of the Philippine Sea . Task Force 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.   On the morning of 19 June,  Yorktown  aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large  bogey  appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle,  Yorktown {'}s planes continued both to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea,  Yorktown  aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.           Yorktown  in June 1944 with planes of  Carrier Air Group 1       On the morning of 20 June,  Yorktown  steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from  Hornet  spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units.  Yorktown  launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral  Ozawa 's force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after  Zuikaku  on whom they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the  Yorktown  air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese.  Yorktown  returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on  Pagan Island  on 22 June and 23 June. On 24 June, she launched another series of raids on  Iwo Jima . On 25 June, she laid in a course for  Eniwetok  and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3 July and 4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and  Chichi Jima . On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on  Yap ,  Ulithi , and the  Palaus . She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.   On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headedvia Eniwetok and Pearl Harborback to the United States.  Yorktown  arrived in the  Puget Sound Navy Yard  on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the  Alameda Naval Air Station  from 11 October to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 October to 24 October,  Yorktown  arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.   On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the  Philippines  in support of the  Leyte  invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November,  Yorktown  arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of  Luzon  in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous  typhoon  of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers Spence ,  Hull , and  Monaghan and  Yorktown  participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.     [ edit ]   1945   Yorktown  fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in  Formosa  and the Philippines in support of the landings at  Lingayen . The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January 1945 on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January,  Yorktown  and the rest of TF 38 entered the  South China Sea  via  Bashi Channel  to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of  Saigon  and  Tourane Bay ,  Indochina , in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional [ citation needed ]  score44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and  Canton  in  China . The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again also went to  Hong Kong . On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via  Balintang Channel . She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on  Okinawa  on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.   Yorktown  remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the  3rd Fleet  becoming the  5th Fleet  when  Spruance  relieved  Halsey , on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the  Tokyo  area of  Honsh . On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and  Yorktown  aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time  Yorktown  cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February,  Yorktown  aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on  Kysh  before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.   She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kysh, Honsh, and  Shikoku .   The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine  bomber , probably a  Yokosuka P1Y  ""Frances"", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over  Yorktown' s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime,  Yorktown  continued air operations. That afternoon, three  Yokosuka D4Y  ""Judy""  dive-bombers  launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26.  Yorktown , however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.   On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kysh. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single ""Judy"" made an apparent suicide dive on  Yorktown . The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about 60 feet (18 m) from (20 m) portside.   On 30 March,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive  battleship   Yamato  was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive.  Yorktown  and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target.  Air Group 9  aviators claimed several torpedo hits on  Yamato  just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three 500 pound bomb hits on  light cruiser   Yahagi  sunk it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action,  Yorktown  and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her.  Yorktown' s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the  Rykys , but  Yorktown  sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   Yorktown  entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6 June and 7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kysh airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on  Minami Daito Shima . After the second day's strikes,  Yorktown  began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in  San Pedro Bay  at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honsh. After a fueling rendezvous on 11 June and 12 June, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island  Hokkaid . Those strikes lasted from 13 June to 15 June. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 June, at which time her aviators returned to the Tokyo area. From 19 June to 22 June, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 June, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the  Kure  naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 June, and on 27 June and 28 June, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29 June and 30 June, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8 August and 9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honsh and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 August and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and, on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.   From 16 August to 23 August,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honsh where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender on board battleship  Missouri  on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied  prisoners of war  still living in their prison camps. On 16 September,  Yorktown  entered  Tokyo Bay  with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in  Buckner Bay  on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.     [ edit ]   1945  1952          Mothballed  Yorktown  at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1948       After a non-stop voyage,  Yorktown  entered  San Francisco Bay  on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to  Hunters Point Navy Yard  to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in  Apra Harbor  on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to  Samar  in the Philippines, she was diverted to  Manila  en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to  Bremerton, Washington , where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947,  Yorktown  was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Bremerton Group,  Pacific Reserve Fleet .     [ edit ]   1953  1955           Yorktown  after the SCB-27A conversion in 1953       Yorktown  remained in reserve for almost five years. In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at  Puget Sound . On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953,  Yorktown  was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain  William M. Nation  in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in  Yokosuka , Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the  Sea of Japan . The  Korean War  armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,  Yorktown  put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the  Academy Award  nominated short subject documentary film  Jet Carrier . She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 July to 28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.   Yorktown  operated out of the Manila- Subic Bay  area, conducting  7th Fleet  maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the  Christmas  holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of  Nationalist Chinese  from the  Tachen Islands  located near the communist-controlled mainland.  Yorktown  entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23 February and 24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. On 21 March 1955, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at the  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  where she was to receive extensive modificationsmost significantly, an angled  flight deck  to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall and, on 14 October, was placed back in full commission.     [ edit ]   1955  1957   The carrier resumed normal operations along the west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953.  Yorktown  stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the  East China Sea , and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as  Sasebo , Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December.  Yorktown  resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.     [ edit ]   1957  1960   On 1 September 1957, her home port was changed from Alameda to  Long Beach, California , and she was reclassified an  antisubmarine warfare  (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation  CVS-10 . On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at  Bangor, Washington , on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months,  Yorktown  conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 November to 17 November,  Yorktown  continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands,  Quemoy  and  Matsu , held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off  Vietnam  during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the  Taiwan Strait . The remainder of the deploymentsave for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in Marchconsisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at  San Diego  on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.   In January 1960,  Yorktown  headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.     [ edit ]   1961  1964   Yorktown  emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for the Far East. During that deployment, she served as  flagship  for  Carrier Division 19 . She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the  SEATO  ASW exercise,  Operation Sea Serpent . The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.   Yorktown  arrived back in her home port on 18 June and resumed normal operations for the remainder of the year. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.     [ edit ]   1965  1968   The 1964 and 1965 deployment brought  Yorktown  her first real involvement in the  Vietnamese civil war . In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnampresumably ASW services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.   For the remainder of her active career,  Yorktown' s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka on 17 February and joined TF 77 on  Yankee Station  later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing ASW and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several ASW exercises, including the major SEATO exercise,  Operation Sea Imp . The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, headed home on 15 July. She disembarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operationscarrier qualifications and ASW exercisesfor the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.   On 24 February 1967,  Yorktown  entered the  Long Beach Naval Shipyard  for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover  Yorktown  headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled in the wake of the  North Korean  capture of  Pueblo . She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo Japan where she stopped from 19 June to 21 June before heading back to the United States.     [ edit ]   1968  1975          The  Apollo 8  Command Module on the deck of the USS  Yorktown       Yorktown  arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie,  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor . In December 1968, she served as one of the  recovery ships  for the  Apollo 8  space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the  West Indies  until late summer. On 2 September,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise  Operation Peacekeeper . During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and  Yorktown  began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to  Brest, France , and  Rotterdam  in the  Netherlands ,  Yorktown  put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises between 18 October and 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at  Kiel ,  Germany . After that, she stopped at  Copenhagen ,  Denmark , and at  Portsmouth ,  England , before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.   During the first half of 1970,  Yorktown  operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970,  Yorktown  was decommissioned at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group,  Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the  Navy List  on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the  Navy Department  approved the donation of  Yorktown  to the  Patriot's Point Development Authority ,  Charleston, South Carolina . She was towed from  Bayonne, New Jersey , to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

Ernest D. McWhorter  in command.   After fitting out, the aircraft carrier trained in  Hampton Roads, Virginia  and in the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes into January 1938, conducting carrier qualifications for her newly embarked air group.   Yorktown  sailed for the  Caribbean  on 8 January 1938 and arrived at  Culebra ,  Puerto Rico , on 13 January. Over the ensuing month, the carrier conducted her shakedown, touching at  Charlotte Amalie ,  St Thomas ,  U.S. Virgin Islands ;  Gonaves ,  Haiti ;  Guantanamo Bay ,  Cuba , and  Cristbal ,  Panama Canal Zone . Departing  Colon Bay , Cristobal, on 1 March,  Yorktown  sailed for Hampton Roads, arrived on 6 March, and shifted to the  Norfolk Navy Yard  the next day for post-shakedown availability.   After undergoing repairs through the early autumn of 1938,  Yorktown  shifted from the navy yard to NOB Norfolk on 17 October and soon headed for the  Southern Drill Grounds  for training.   Yorktown  operated off the eastern seaboard, ranging from  Chesapeake Bay  to Guantanamo Bay, into 1939. As flagship for  Carrier Division 2 , she participated in her first war game -  Fleet Problem XX  - along with her sister-ship  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in February 1939. The scenario for the exercise called for one fleet to control the sea lanes in the Caribbean against the incursion of a foreign European power while maintaining sufficient naval strength to protect vital American interests in the Pacific. The maneuvers were witnessed, in part, by President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt , embarked in the heavy cruiser  USS  Houston  (CA-30) .   The critique of the operation revealed that carrier operations - a part of the scenarios for the annual exercises since the entry of  USS  Langley  (CV-1)  into the war games in 1925 - had achieved a new peak of efficiency. Despite the inexperience of  Yorktown  and  Enterprise  - comparative newcomers to the Fleet - both carriers made significant contributions to the success of the problem. The planners had studied the employment of carriers and their embarked air groups in connection with convoy escort, antisubmarine defense, and various attack measures against surface ships and shore installations. In short, they worked to develop the tactics that would be used when war actually came.     [ edit ]   Pacific Fleet   Following Fleet Problem XX,  Yorktown  returned briefly to Hampton Roads before sailing for the  Pacific  on 20 April 1939. Transiting the  Panama Canal  a week later,  Yorktown  soon commenced a regular routine of operations with the  Pacific Fleet . Operating out of  San Diego, California  into 1940, the carrier participated in  Fleet Problem XXI  that April.  Yorktown  was one of six ships to receive the new  RCA   CXAM   RADAR  in 1940. [ 1 ]   Fleet Problem XXI - a two-part exercise - included some of the operations that would characterize future warfare in the Pacific. The first part of the exercise was devoted to training in making plans and estimates; in screening and scouting; in coordination of combatant units; and in employing fleet and standard dispositions. The second phase included training in  convoy  protection, the seizure of advanced bases, and, ultimately, the decisive engagement between the opposing fleets. The last pre-war exercise of its type, Fleet Problem XXI, contained two exercises (comparatively minor at the time) where air operations played a major role. Fleet Joint Air Exercise 114A prophetically pointed out the need to coordinate Army and Navy defense plans for the  Hawaiian Islands , and Fleet Exercise 114 proved that aircraft could be used for high altitude tracking of surface forces - a significant role for planes that would be fully realized in the war to come.   With the retention of the Fleet in Hawaiian waters after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI,  Yorktown  operated in the Pacific off the west coast of the United States and in Hawaiian waters until the following spring, when the success of German  U-boats  preying upon British shipping in the Atlantic required a shift of American naval strength. Thus, to reinforce the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet , the Navy transferred a substantial force from the Pacific including  Yorktown , Battleship Division Three (the  New Mexico class battleships ), three light cruisers, and 12 accompanying destroyers.     [ edit ]   Neutrality patrol   Yorktown  departed  Pearl Harbor  on 20 April 1941 in company with  USS  Warrington  (DD-383) ,  USS  Somers  (DD-381) , and  USS  Jouett  (DD-396) ; headed southeast, transited the Panama Canal on the night of 67 May, and arrived at  Bermuda  on 12 May. From that time until the United States entered the war,  Yorktown  conducted four patrols in the Atlantic, ranging from  Newfoundland  to Bermuda and logging 17,642 miles (28,392 km) steamed while enforcing American neutrality.   Although  Adolf Hitler  had forbidden his  submarines  to attack American ships, the men who manned the American naval vessels were not aware of this policy and operated on a wartime footing in the Atlantic.   On 28 October, while  Yorktown , battleship  USS  New Mexico  (BB-40) , and other American warships were screening a convoy, a destroyer picked up a submarine contact and dropped depth charges while the convoy itself made an emergency starboard turn, the first of the convoy's three emergency changes of course. Late that afternoon, engine repairs to one of the ships in the convoy,  Empire Pintail , reduced the convoy's speed to 11 knots (13 mph; 20 km/h).   During the night, the American ships intercepted strong German radio signals, indicating submarines probably in the vicinity reporting the group. Rear Admiral  H. Kent Hewitt , commanding the escort force, sent a destroyer to sweep astern of the convoy to destroy the U-boat or at least to drive him under.   The next day, while cruiser scout planes patrolled overhead,  Yorktown  and  USS  Savannah  (CL-42)  fueled their escorting destroyers, finishing the task as dusk fell. On 30 October,  Yorktown  was preparing to fuel three destroyers when other escorts made sound contacts. The convoy subsequently made 10 emergency turns while  USS  Morris  (DD-417)  and  USS  Anderson  (DD-411)  dropped depth charges, and  USS  Hughes  (DD-410)  assisted in developing the contact. Anderson later made two more depth charge attacks, noticing ""considerable oil with slick spreading but no wreckage.""   The short-of-war period was becoming more like the real thing as each day went on. Elsewhere on 30 October and more than a month before Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor,  U-562  torpedoed the destroyer  USS  Reuben James  (DD-245) , sinking her with a heavy loss of life - the first loss of an American warship in World War II.   After another Neutrality Patrol stint in November,  Yorktown  put into Norfolk on 2 December and was there five days later when American fighting men in Hawaii were rudely awakened to find their country at war.     [ edit ]   World War II     See also:  World War II             Yorktown  prepares to get underway in June, 1940.       The early news from the Pacific was bleak: the Pacific Fleet had taken a beating. With the battle line crippled, the undamaged American carriers assumed great importance. There were, on 7 December, only three in the Pacific:  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6) ,  USS  Lexington  (CV-2) , and  USS  Saratoga  (CV-3) .  USS  Ranger  (CV-4) ,  USS  Wasp  (CV-7) , and the recently commissioned  USS  Hornet  (CV-8)  remained in the Atlantic,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk on 16 December 1941 for the Pacific, her secondary gun galleries studded with new  Oerlikon 20 mm guns . She reached San Diego 30 December 1941 and soon became flagship for Rear Admiral  Frank Jack Fletcher 's newly formed  Task Force 17 .   The carrier's first mission in her new theater was to escort a convoy carrying Marine reinforcements to  American Samoa . Departing San Diego on 6 January 1942,  Yorktown  and her consorts covered the movement of marines to  Tutuila  and  Pago Pago  to augment the garrison already there.   Having safely covered that troop movement,  Yorktown , in company with sister ship  Enterprise , departed Samoan waters on 25 January. Six days later, TF8 (built around  Enterprise ), and TF17 (around  Yorktown ) parted company. The former headed for the  Marshall Islands , the latter for the  Gilberts , each to take part in some of the first American offensives of the war, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids.   At 05:17,  Yorktown  - screened by  USS  Louisville  (CA-28)  and  USS  St. Louis  (CL-49)  and four destroyers - launched 11 Douglas  TBD-1 Devastators  and 17 Douglas  SBD-3 Dauntlesses , under the command of Comdr.  Curtis W. Smiley . Those planes hit what Japanese shore installations and shipping they could find at  Jaluit , but severe thunderstorms hampered the mission, and seven planes were lost. Other  Yorktown  planes attacked Japanese installations and ships at  Makin  and  Mili  Atolls.   The attack on the Gilberts by TF17 had apparently been a complete surprise since the American force encountered no enemy surface ships. A single four-engined  Kawanishi H6K  ""Mavis"" patrol flying boat attempted to attack American destroyers sent astern in hope of recovering the crews of planes overdue from the Jaluit mission. Antiaircraft fire from the destroyers drove off the intruder before he could cause any damage.   Later, another ""Mavis""-or possibly the same one-came out of low clouds 15,000 yards (14,000 m) distant from  Yorktown . The carrier withheld her antiaircraft fire in order not to interfere with the  combat air patrol  (CAP) fighters. Presently, the ""Mavis"", pursued by two  F4F Wildcats , disappeared behind a cloud. Within five minutes, the enemy patrol plane fell out of the clouds and crashed in the water.   Although TF17 was slated to make a second attack on Jaluit, it was canceled because of heavy rainstorms and the approach of darkness. Therefore, the  Yorktown  force retired from the area.   Admiral  Chester Nimitz  later called the Marshalls-Gilberts raids ""well conceived, well planned, and brilliantly executed."" The results obtained by TFs 8 and 17 were noteworthy, Nimitz continued in his subsequent report, because the task forces had been obliged to make their attacks somewhat blindly, due to lack of hard intelligence data on the Japanese-mandated islands.   Yorktown  subsequently put in at Pearl Harbor for replenishment before she put to sea on 14 February, bound for the  Coral Sea . On 6 March, she rendezvoused with TF11 - formed around  Lexington  and under the command of Rear Admiral  Wilson Brown  - and headed towards  Rabaul  and  Gasmata  to attack Japanese shipping there in an effort to check the Japanese advance and to cover the landing of Allied troops at  Nouma ,  New Caledonia . However, as the two carriers - screened by a powerful force of eight heavy cruisers (including the Australian  HMAS  Australia  and 14 destroyers - steamed toward  New Guinea , the Japanese continued their advance toward Australia with a landing on 7 March at the  Huon Gulf , in the  Salamaua - Lae  area on the eastern end of New Guinea.   Word of the Japanese operation prompted Admiral Brown to change the objective of TF11's strike from Rabaul to the Salamaua-Lae sector. On the morning of 10 March 1942, American carriers launched aircraft from the  Gulf of Papua .  Lexington  flew off her air group commencing at 07:49 and, 21 minutes later,  Yorktown  followed suit. While the choice of the gulf as the launch point for the strike meant the planes would have to fly some 125 miles (201 km) across the  Owen Stanley mountains  - a range not known for the best flying conditions - that approach provided security for the task force and ensured surprise.   In the attacks that followed,  Lexington's  SBDs from Scouting Squadron 2 (VS-2) commenced dive-bombing Japanese ships at Lae at 0922. The carrier's torpedo and bomber squadrons (VT-2 and VB-2) attacked shipping at Salamaua at 09:38. Her fighters (VF-2) split up into four-plane attack groups: one strafed Lae and the other, Salamaua.  Yorktown's  planes followed on the heels of those from ""Lady Lex."" VB-5 and VT-5 attacked Japanese ships in the Salamaua area at 0950, while VS-5 went after auxiliaries moored close in shore at Lae. The fighters of VF-42 flew CAP over Salamaua until they determined there was no air opposition, then strafed surface objectives and small boats in the harbor.   After carrying out their missions, the American planes returned to their carriers, and 103 planes of the 104 launched were back safely on board by noon. One SBD-2 had been downed by Japanese antiaircraft fire. The raid on Salamaua and Lae was the first attack by many pilots of both carriers; and, while the resultant torpedo and bombing accuracy was inferior to that achieved in later actions, the operation gave the fliers invaluable experience which enabled them to do so well in the  Battle of the Coral Sea  and the Battle of Midway.          The  Yorktown  is refueled by the  USS  Brazos  (AO-4)  mid-Pacific in July 1940.       Task Force 11 retired at 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) on a southeasterly course until dark, when the ships steered eastward at 15 knots (17 mph; 28 km/h) and made rendezvous with  Task Group 11.7  (TG11.7), four  heavy cruisers  and four destroyers under the Australian Rear Admiral  John Crace , which provided cover for the carriers on their approach to New Guinea.   Yorktown  resumed her patrols in the Coral Sea area, remaining at sea into April, out of reach of Japanese land-based aircraft and ready to carry out offensive operations whenever the opportunity presented itself. After the Lae-Salamaua raid, the situation in the South Pacific seemed temporarily stabilized, and  Yorktown  and her consorts in TF17 put in to the undeveloped harbor at  Tongatapu , in the  Tonga  Islands, for needed upkeep, having been at sea continuously since departing from Pearl Harbor on 14 February.   However, the enemy was soon on the move. To Admiral Nimitz, there seemed to be ""excellent indications that the Japanese intended to make a seaborne attack on  Port Moresby  the first week in May.""  Yorktown  accordingly departed Tongatapu on 27 April 1942, bound once more for the Coral Sea. TF11 - now commanded by Rear Admiral  Aubrey W. Fitch , who had relieved Brown in  Lexington  - departed Pearl Harbor to join Fletcher's TF 17 and arrived in the vicinity of  Yorktown's  group, southwest of the  New Hebrides  Islands, on 1 May.     [ edit ]   Battle of the Coral Sea       Main article:  Battle of the Coral Sea       At 15:17 the next afternoon, two Dauntlesses from VS-5 sighted a Japanese submarine, running on the surface. Three Devastators took off from  Yorktown , sped to the scene, and carried out an attack that only succeeded in driving the submarine under.   On the morning of 3 May, TF11 and TF17 were some 100 miles (200 km) apart, engaged in fueling operations. Shortly before midnight, Fletcher received word from Australian-based aircraft that Japanese transports were disembarking troops and equipment at  Tulagi  in the  Solomon Islands . Arriving soon after the Australians had evacuated the place, the Japanese landed to commence construction of a seaplane base there to support their southward thrust.   Yorktown  accordingly set course northward at 27 knots (31 mph; 50 km/h). By daybreak on 4 May, she was within striking distance of the newly established Japanese beachhead and launched her first strike at 0701-18 F4F-3's of VF-42, 12 TBD's of VT-5, and 28 SBD's from VS and BY-5.  Yorktown's  air group made three consecutive attacks on enemy ships and shore installations at Tulagi and  Gavutu  on the south coast of  Florida Island  in the Solomons. Expending 22 torpedoes and 76 1,000 pound bombs in the three attacks,  Yorktown's  planes sank the destroyer  Kikuzuki , three minecraft and four barges. In addition, Air Group 5 destroyed five enemy seaplanes, all at the cost of two F4F's lost (the pilots were recovered) and one TBD (whose crew was lost).   Meanwhile, that same day, TF 44, a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Admiral Crace (RN), joined  Lexington's  TF11, thus completing the composition of the Allied force on the eve of the crucial Battle of the Coral Sea.   Elsewhere, to the northward, eleven troop-laden transports - escorted by destroyers and covered by the light carrier  Shh , four heavy cruisers, and a destroyer - steamed toward Port Moresby. In addition, another Japanese task force - formed around the two Pearl Harbor veterans, carriers  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku , and screened by two heavy cruisers and six destroyers - provided additional air cover.   On the morning of 6 May, Fletcher gathered all Allied forces under his tactical command as TF17. At daybreak on the 7th, he dispatched Crace, with the cruisers and destroyers under his command, toward the  Louisiade  archipelago to intercept any enemy attempt to move toward Port Moresby.   While Fletcher moved north with his two flattops and their screens in search of the enemy, Japanese search planes located the oiler  USS  Neosho  (AO-23)  and her escort,  USS  Sims  (DD-409)  and misidentified the former as a carrier. Two waves of Japanese planes  first high level bombers and then dive bombers  attacked the two ships.  Sims , her antiaircraft battery crippled by gun failures, took three direct hits and sank quickly with a heavy loss of life.  Neosho  was more fortunate in that, even after seven direct hits and eight near-misses, she remained afloat until, on the 11th, her survivors were picked up by  USS  Henley  (DD-391)  and her hulk sunk by the rescuing destroyer.   Neosho  and  Sims  had performed a valuable service, drawing off the planes that might otherwise have hit Fletcher's carriers. Meanwhile,  Yorktown  and  Lexington's  planes found  Shh  and sunk her. One of  Lexington's  pilots reported this victory with the radio message, ""Scratch one flattop"".   That afternoon,  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku  - still not located by Fletcher's forces - launched 27 bombers and torpedo planes to search for the American ships. Their flight proved uneventful until they ran into fighters from  Yorktown  and  Lexington , who proceeded to down nine enemy planes in the ensuing dogfight.   Near twilight, three Japanese planes incredibly mistook  Yorktown  for their own carrier and attempted to land. The ship's gunfire, though, drove them off; and the enemy planes crossed  Yorktown' s bow and turned away out of range. Twenty minutes later, when three more enemy pilots made the mistake of trying to get into  Yorktown's  landing circle, the carrier's gunners splashed one of the trio.   However, the battle was far from over. The next morning, 8 May, a  Lexington  search plane spotted Admiral  Takeo Takagi 's carrier striking force - including  Zuikaku  and  Shkaku .  Yorktown  planes scored two bomb hits on  Shkaku , damaging her flight deck and preventing her from launching aircraft; in addition, the bombs set off explosions in gasoline storage tanks and destroyed an engine repair workshop.  Lexington' s Dauntlesses added another hit. Between the two American air groups, the hits killed 108 Japanese sailors and wounded 40 more.   While the American planes were occupying the Japanese flattops, however,  Yorktown  and  Lexington  - alerted by an intercepted message which indicated that the Japanese knew of their whereabouts - were preparing to fight off a retaliatory strike, which came shortly after 11:00.   American CAP Wildcats downed 17 planes, though some managed to slip through the defenses.  ""Kates""  launched torpedoes from both sides of  Lexington's  bows. Two ""fish"" tore into ""Lady Lex"" on the port side;  ""Val""   dive bombers  added to the destruction with three bomb hits.  Lexington  developed a list, with three partially-flooded engineering spaces. Several fires raged below decks, and the carrier's elevators were put out of commission.   Meanwhile  Yorktown  was having problems of her own. Maneuvered by Captain  Elliott Buckmaster , her commanding officer, the carrier dodged eight torpedoes. Attacked then by ""Vals"", the ship managed to evade all but one bomb. That one, however, penetrated the flight deck and exploded below decks, killing or seriously injuring 66 men.   Lexington's  damage control parties brought the fires under control, and the ship was still able to continue flight operations despite the damage. The air battle itself ended shortly before noon on the 8th; within an hour, the carrier was on an even keel, although slightly down by the bow. However, an explosion caused by the ignition of gasoline vapors later caused a fire and tore apart the inside.  Lexington  was abandoned at 1707, and later sunk by  USS  Phelps  (DD-361) .   The Japanese had won a tactical victory, inflicting comparatively heavier losses on the Allied force, but the Allies, in stemming the tide of Japan's conquests in the South and Southwest Pacific, had achieved a strategic victory.  Yorktown  had not achieved her part in the victory without cost, and had suffered enough damage to cause experts to estimate that at least three months in a yard would be required to put her back in fighting trim. However, there was little time for repairs, because Allied intelligence - most notably the cryptographic unit at Pearl Harbor - had gained enough information from decoded Japanese naval messages to estimate that the Japanese were on the threshold of a major operation aimed at the northwestern tip of the Hawaiian chain - two islets in a low coral atoll known as  Midway .     [ edit ]   Battle of Midway       Main article:  Battle of Midway               Yorktown  in drydock shortly before the Battle of Midway       Armed with this intelligence Admiral Nimitz began methodically planning Midway's defense, rushing all possible reinforcement in the way of men, planes and guns to Midway. In addition, he began gathering his naval forces - comparatively meager as they were - to meet the enemy at sea. As part of those preparations, he recalled TF16,  Enterprise  and  Hornet  (CV-8), to Pearl Harbor for a quick replenishment.   Yorktown , too, received orders to return to Hawaii; and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 May. Performing a seeming miracle, yard workers there - laboring around the clock - made enough repairs to enable the ship to put to sea. Her air group - for the most part experienced but weary - was augmented by planes and crews from  Saratoga  (CV-3) which was then headed for Hawaiian waters after her modernization on the west coast. Ready for battle,  Yorktown  sailed as the core of TF17 on 30 May.   Northeast of Midway,  Yorktown , flying Rear Admiral Fletcher's flag, rendezvoused with TF16 under Rear Admiral  Raymond A. Spruance  and maintained a position 10 miles (20 km) to the northward of him.   Patrols, both from Midway itself and from the carriers, proceeded apace during those days in early June. On the morning of the 4th as dawn began to streak the eastern sky,  Yorktown  launched a 10-plane group of Dauntlesses from VB-5 which searched a northern semicircle for a distance of 100 miles (200 km) out but found nothing.   Meanwhile,  PBYs  flying from Midway had sighted the approaching Japanese and broadcast the alarm for the American forces defending the key atoll. Admiral Fletcher, in tactical command, ordered Admiral Spruance's TF16 to locate the enemy carrier force and strike them as soon as they were found.   Yorktown's  search group returned at 0830, landing soon after the last of the six-plane CAP had left the deck. When the last of the Dauntlesses were recovered, the deck was hastily respotted for the launch of the ship's attack group - 17 Dauntlesses from VB-3; 12 Devastators from VT-3, and six Wildcats from ""Fighting Three.""  Enterprise  and  Hornet , meanwhile, launched their attack groups.   The torpedo planes from the three American carriers located the Japanese striking force, but met disaster. Of the 41 planes from VT-8, VT-6, and VT-3, only six returned to  Enterprise  and  Yorktown , collectively. None made it back to  Hornet .   The destruction of the torpedo planes, however, had served a purpose. The Japanese CAP had broken off their high-altitude cover for their carriers and had concentrated on the Devastators, flying ""on the deck."" The skies above were thus left open for Dauntlesses arriving from  Yorktown  and  Enterprise .   Virtually unopposed,  Yorktown's  dive-bombers pummeled  Japanese aircraft carrier  Sry , making three lethal hits with 1,000 pound bombs, turning her into an inferno. [ 2 ]   Enterprise's  planes, meanwhile, hit  Japanese aircraft carrier  Akagi  and  Japanese aircraft carrier  Kaga  - turning them, too into wrecks in short order. The bombs from the Dauntlesses caught all of the Japanese carriers in the midst of refueling and rearming operations, and the combination of bombs and gasoline proved explosive and disastrous to the Japanese.   Three Japanese carriers had been lost. A fourth however, still roamed at large -  Japanese aircraft carrier  Hiry . Separated from her sisters, she launched a striking force of 18 ""Vals"" and soon located  Yorktown .          Smoke pours from  Yorktown  after being hit in the boilers by Japanese dive bombers at Midway.       As soon as the attackers had been picked up on  Yorktown' s radar at about 1329, she discontinued fueling her CAP fighters on deck and swiftly cleared for action. Her returning dive bombers were moved from the landing circle to open the area for antiaircraft fire. The Dauntlesses were ordered aloft to form a CAP. An auxiliary gasoline tank - of 800 gallons capacity - was pushed over the carrier's fantail, eliminating one fire hazard. The crew drained fuel lines and closed and secured all compartments.   All of  Yorktown' s fighters were vectored out to intercept the oncoming Japanese aircraft, and did so some 15 to 20 miles (30 km) out. The Wildcats attacked vigorously, breaking up what appeared to be an organized attack by some 18 ""Vals"" and 18 ""Zeroes."" ""Planes were flying in every direction"", wrote Captain Buckmaster after the action, ""and many were falling in flames."" The leader of the ""Vals"", Lieutenant Joichi Tomonaga, was probably shot down by the  VF-3 's commanding officer,  Lieutenant Commander  John S. Thach. [1] .   Despite an intensive barrage and evasive maneuvering, three ""Vals"" scored hits. Two of them were shot down soon after releasing their bomb loads; the third went out of control just as his bomb left the rack. It tumbled in flight and hit just abaft number two elevator on the starboard side, exploding on contact and blasting a hole about 10 feet (3 m) square in the flight deck. Splinters from the exploding bomb decimated the crews of the two 1.1-inch (28 mm) gun mounts aft of the island and on the flight deck below. Fragments piercing the flight deck hit three planes on the hangar deck, starting fires. One of the aircraft, a  Yorktown  Dauntless, was fully fueled and carrying a 1,000 pound bomb. Prompt action by Lt. A. C. Emerson, the hangar deck officer, prevented a serious conflagration by activating the sprinkler system and quickly extinguishing the fire.   The second bomb to hit the ship came from the port side, pierced the flight deck, and exploded in the lower part of the  funnel . It ruptured the uptakes for three boilers, disabled two boilers themselves, and extinguished the fires in five boilers. Smoke and gases began filling the firerooms of six boilers. The men at number one boiler, however, remained at their post despite their danger and discomfort and kept its fire going, maintaining enough steam pressure to allow the auxiliary steam systems to function.   A third bomb hit the carrier from the starboard side, pierced the side of number one elevator and exploded on the fourth deck, starting a persistent fire in the rag storage space, adjacent to the forward gasoline stowage and the magazines. The prior precaution of smothering the gasoline system with carbon dioxide undoubtedly prevented the gasoline from igniting.   While the ship recovered from the damage inflicted by the dive-bombing attack, her speed dropped to six knots; and then at 14:40, about 20 minutes after the bomb hit that had shut down most of the boilers,  Yorktown  slowed to a stop, dead in the water.   At about 15:40,  Yorktown  prepared to get steaming again; and, at 1550, the engine room force reported that they were ready to make 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) or better. The ship was not yet out of the fight.   Simultaneously, with the fires controlled sufficiently to warrant the resumption of fueling,  Yorktown  began refueling the fighters then on deck; just then the ship's radar picked up an incoming air group at a distance of 33 miles (53 km). While the ship prepared for battle - again smothering gasoline systems and stopping the fueling of the planes on her flight deck - she vectored four of the six fighters of the CAP in the air to intercept the raiders. Of the 10 fighters on board, eight had as little as 23 gallons of fuel in their tanks. They were launched as the remaining pair of fighters of the CAP headed out to intercept the Japanese planes.           Yorktown  is hit on the port side, amidships, by a Japanese Type 91 aerial torpedo during the mid-afternoon attack by planes from the carrier  Hiryu .       At 16:00, maneuvering  Yorktown  churned forward, making 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h). The fighters she had launched and vectored out to intercept had meanwhile made contact with the enemy.  Yorktown  received reports that the planes were ""Kates."" The Wildcats shot down at least three, but the rest began their approach while the carrier and her escorts mounted a heavy antiaircraft barrage.   Yorktown  maneuvered radically, avoiding at least two torpedoes before another two struck the port side within minutes of each other, the first at 16:20. The carrier had been mortally wounded; she lost power and went dead in the water with a jammed rudder and an increasing list to port.   As the list progressed  Commander   C. E. Aldrich , the damage control officer, reported from central station that, without power, controlling the flooding looked impossible. The engineering officer, Lt. Cdr.  J. F. Delaney , soon reported that all fires were out, but all power was lost and it was impossible to correct the list. Buckmaster ordered Aldrich, Delaney, and their men to secure and lay up on deck to put on life jackets.   The list, meanwhile, continued to increase. When it reached 26 degrees, Buckmaster and Aldrich agreed that capsizing was imminent. ""In order to save as many of the ship's company as possible"", the captain wrote later, he ""ordered the ship to be abandoned.""   Over the next few minutes the crew lowered the wounded into life rafts and struck out for the nearby destroyers and cruisers to be picked up by their boats, abandoning ship in good order. After the evacuation of all wounded, the executive officer, Commander  I. D. Wiltsie , left the ship down a line on the starboard side. Buckmaster, meanwhile, toured the ship one last time, to see if any men remained. After finding no ""live personnel"", Buckmaster lowered himself into the water by means of a line over the stern, by which time water was lapping the port side of the hangar deck.     [ edit ]   Salvage and sinking   After being picked up by the destroyer  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , Buckmaster transferred to  USS  Astoria  (CA-34)  and reported to Rear Admiral Fletcher, who had shifted his flag to the heavy cruiser after the first dive-bombing attack. The two men agreed that a salvage party should attempt to save the ship, since she had stubbornly remained afloat despite the heavy list and imminent danger of capsizing.   While efforts to save  Yorktown  had been proceeding apace, her planes were still in action, joining those from  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in striking the last Japanese carrier -  Hiry  - late that afternoon. Taking four direct hits, the Japanese carrier was soon helpless. She was abandoned by her crew and left to drift out of control.   Yorktown , as it turned out, floated throughout the night. Two men were still alive on board her; one attracted attention by firing a machine gun, heard by the sole attending destroyer,  Hughes . The escort picked up the men, one of whom later died.   Meanwhile, Buckmaster had selected 29 officers and 141 men to return to the ship in an attempt to save her. Five destroyers formed an antisubmarine screen while the salvage party boarded the listing carrier, the fire in the rag storage still smouldering on the morning of the 6th.  USS  Vireo  (AT-144) , summoned from  Pearl and Hermes Reef , soon commenced towing the ship. Progress, though, was painfully slow.   Yorktown' s repair party went on board with a carefully predetermined plan of action to be carried out by men from each department - damage control, gunnery air engineering, navigation, communication, supply and medical. To assist in the work, Lt. Cdr.  Arnold E. True  brought his ship,  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , alongside to starboard, aft, furnishing pumps and electric power.   By mid-afternoon, it looked as if the gamble to save the ship was paying off. The process of reducing topside weight was proceeding well - one 5-inch (127 mm) gun had been dropped over the side, and a second was ready to be cast loose; planes had been pushed over the side; the submersible pumps (powered by electricity provided by  Hammann ) had pumped a lot of water out of the engineering spaces. The efforts of the salvage crew had reduced the list about two degrees.          USS  Hammann  (DD-412) sinking with stern high, after being torpedoed by  Japanese submarine  I-168       Unknown to  Yorktown  and the six nearby destroyers,  Japanese submarine  I-168  had achieved a favorable firing position. Remarkably - but perhaps understandably due to the debris and wreckage in the water in the vicinity - none of the destroyers picked up the approaching I-boat. At 15:36 lookouts spotted a salvo of four torpedoes approaching the ship from the starboard beam.   Hammann  went to general quarters, a 20 millimeter gun going into action in an attempt to explode the torpedoes in the water. One torpedo hit  Hammann  - her screws churning the water beneath her fantail as she tried to get underway - directly amidships and broke her back. The destroyer jackknifed and went down rapidly.   Two torpedoes struck  Yorktown  just below the turn of the bilge at the after end of the island structure. The fourth torpedo passed just astern of the carrier.   About a minute after  Hammann  sank there was an underwater explosion, possibly caused by the destroyer's depth charges going off. The blast killed many of  Hammann's  and a few of  Yorktown's  men who had been thrown into the water. The concussion battered the already-damaged carrier's hull and caused tremendous shocks that carried away  Yorktown's  auxiliary generator, sent numerous fixtures from the hangar deck overhead crashing to the deck below, sheared rivets in the starboard leg of the foremast, and threw men in every direction, causing broken bones and several minor injuries.   All destroyers immediately commenced searches for the enemy submarine (which escaped) and commenced rescuing men from  Hammann  and  Yorktown . Captain Buckmaster decided to postpone further attempts at salvage until the following day.   Vireo  cut the tow and doubled back to  Yorktown  to pick up survivors, taking on board many men of the salvage crew while picking up men from the water. The little ship endured a terrific pounding from the larger ship but nevertheless stayed alongside to carry out her rescue mission. Later, while on board the tug, Buckmaster conducted a burial service, and two officers and an enlisted man from  Hammann  were buried at sea.   The second attempt at salvage was never made. Throughout the night of the 6th and into the morning of the 7th,  Yorktown  remained stubbornly afloat. By 05:30 on 7 June, however, the men in the ships nearby noted that the carrier's list was rapidly increasing to port. At 07:01, the ship turned over onto her port side and sank in 3,000 fathoms (5,500 m) of water, her battle flags flying.     [ edit ]   Honors and rediscovery   Yorktown  (CV-5) earned three  battle stars  for her World War II service, two of them for the significant part she had played in stopping Japanese expansion and turning the tide of the war at Coral Sea and at Midway.   On 19 May 1998, the wreck of  Yorktown  was found and photographed by renowned oceanographer Dr.  Robert D. Ballard , discoverer of the wreck of the  RMS  Titanic . The wreck, 3 miles (5 km) beneath the surface, was surprisingly intact after having been on the sea bottom since 1942much paint and equipment were still visible.

Ernest D. McWhorter  in command.   After fitting out, the aircraft carrier trained in  Hampton Roads, Virginia  and in the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes into January 1938, conducting carrier qualifications for her newly embarked air group.   Yorktown  sailed for the  Caribbean  on 8 January 1938 and arrived at  Culebra ,  Puerto Rico , on 13 January. Over the ensuing month, the carrier conducted her shakedown, touching at  Charlotte Amalie ,  St Thomas ,  U.S. Virgin Islands ;  Gonaves ,  Haiti ;  Guantanamo Bay ,  Cuba , and  Cristbal ,  Panama Canal Zone . Departing  Colon Bay , Cristobal, on 1 March,  Yorktown  sailed for Hampton Roads, arrived on 6 March, and shifted to the  Norfolk Navy Yard  the next day for post-shakedown availability.   After undergoing repairs through the early autumn of 1938,  Yorktown  shifted from the navy yard to NOB Norfolk on 17 October and soon headed for the  Southern Drill Grounds  for training.   Yorktown  operated off the eastern seaboard, ranging from  Chesapeake Bay  to Guantanamo Bay, into 1939. As flagship for  Carrier Division 2 , she participated in her first war game -  Fleet Problem XX  - along with her sister-ship  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in February 1939. The scenario for the exercise called for one fleet to control the sea lanes in the Caribbean against the incursion of a foreign European power while maintaining sufficient naval strength to protect vital American interests in the Pacific. The maneuvers were witnessed, in part, by President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt , embarked in the heavy cruiser  USS  Houston  (CA-30) .   The critique of the operation revealed that carrier operations - a part of the scenarios for the annual exercises since the entry of  USS  Langley  (CV-1)  into the war games in 1925 - had achieved a new peak of efficiency. Despite the inexperience of  Yorktown  and  Enterprise  - comparative newcomers to the Fleet - both carriers made significant contributions to the success of the problem. The planners had studied the employment of carriers and their embarked air groups in connection with convoy escort, antisubmarine defense, and various attack measures against surface ships and shore installations. In short, they worked to develop the tactics that would be used when war actually came.     [ edit ]   Pacific Fleet   Following Fleet Problem XX,  Yorktown  returned briefly to Hampton Roads before sailing for the  Pacific  on 20 April 1939. Transiting the  Panama Canal  a week later,  Yorktown  soon commenced a regular routine of operations with the  Pacific Fleet . Operating out of  San Diego, California  into 1940, the carrier participated in  Fleet Problem XXI  that April.  Yorktown  was one of six ships to receive the new  RCA   CXAM   RADAR  in 1940. [ 1 ]   Fleet Problem XXI - a two-part exercise - included some of the operations that would characterize future warfare in the Pacific. The first part of the exercise was devoted to training in making plans and estimates; in screening and scouting; in coordination of combatant units; and in employing fleet and standard dispositions. The second phase included training in  convoy  protection, the seizure of advanced bases, and, ultimately, the decisive engagement between the opposing fleets. The last pre-war exercise of its type, Fleet Problem XXI, contained two exercises (comparatively minor at the time) where air operations played a major role. Fleet Joint Air Exercise 114A prophetically pointed out the need to coordinate Army and Navy defense plans for the  Hawaiian Islands , and Fleet Exercise 114 proved that aircraft could be used for high altitude tracking of surface forces - a significant role for planes that would be fully realized in the war to come.   With the retention of the Fleet in Hawaiian waters after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI,  Yorktown  operated in the Pacific off the west coast of the United States and in Hawaiian waters until the following spring, when the success of German  U-boats  preying upon British shipping in the Atlantic required a shift of American naval strength. Thus, to reinforce the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet , the Navy transferred a substantial force from the Pacific including  Yorktown , Battleship Division Three (the  New Mexico class battleships ), three light cruisers, and 12 accompanying destroyers.     [ edit ]   Neutrality patrol   Yorktown  departed  Pearl Harbor  on 20 April 1941 in company with  USS  Warrington  (DD-383) ,  USS  Somers  (DD-381) , and  USS  Jouett  (DD-396) ; headed southeast, transited the Panama Canal on the night of 67 May, and arrived at  Bermuda  on 12 May. From that time until the United States entered the war,  Yorktown  conducted four patrols in the Atlantic, ranging from  Newfoundland  to Bermuda and logging 17,642 miles (28,392 km) steamed while enforcing American neutrality.   Although  Adolf Hitler  had forbidden his  submarines  to attack American ships, the men who manned the American naval vessels were not aware of this policy and operated on a wartime footing in the Atlantic.   On 28 October, while  Yorktown , battleship  USS  New Mexico  (BB-40) , and other American warships were screening a convoy, a destroyer picked up a submarine contact and dropped depth charges while the convoy itself made an emergency starboard turn, the first of the convoy's three emergency changes of course. Late that afternoon, engine repairs to one of the ships in the convoy,  Empire Pintail , reduced the convoy's speed to 11 knots (13 mph; 20 km/h).   During the night, the American ships intercepted strong German radio signals, indicating submarines probably in the vicinity reporting the group. Rear Admiral  H. Kent Hewitt , commanding the escort force, sent a destroyer to sweep astern of the convoy to destroy the U-boat or at least to drive him under.   The next day, while cruiser scout planes patrolled overhead,  Yorktown  and  USS  Savannah  (CL-42)  fueled their escorting destroyers, finishing the task as dusk fell. On 30 October,  Yorktown  was preparing to fuel three destroyers when other escorts made sound contacts. The convoy subsequently made 10 emergency turns while  USS  Morris  (DD-417)  and  USS  Anderson  (DD-411)  dropped depth charges, and  USS  Hughes  (DD-410)  assisted in developing the contact. Anderson later made two more depth charge attacks, noticing ""considerable oil with slick spreading but no wreckage.""   The short-of-war period was becoming more like the real thing as each day went on. Elsewhere on 30 October and more than a month before Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor,  U-562  torpedoed the destroyer  USS  Reuben James  (DD-245) , sinking her with a heavy loss of life - the first loss of an American warship in World War II.   After another Neutrality Patrol stint in November,  Yorktown  put into Norfolk on 2 December and was there five days later when American fighting men in Hawaii were rudely awakened to find their country at war.     [ edit ]   World War II     See also:  World War II             Yorktown  prepares to get underway in June, 1940.       The early news from the Pacific was bleak: the Pacific Fleet had taken a beating. With the battle line crippled, the undamaged American carriers assumed great importance. There were, on 7 December, only three in the Pacific:  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6) ,  USS  Lexington  (CV-2) , and  USS  Saratoga  (CV-3) .  USS  Ranger  (CV-4) ,  USS  Wasp  (CV-7) , and the recently commissioned  USS  Hornet  (CV-8)  remained in the Atlantic,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk on 16 December 1941 for the Pacific, her secondary gun galleries studded with new  Oerlikon 20 mm guns . She reached San Diego 30 December 1941 and soon became flagship for Rear Admiral  Frank Jack Fletcher 's newly formed  Task Force 17 .   The carrier's first mission in her new theater was to escort a convoy carrying Marine reinforcements to  American Samoa . Departing San Diego on 6 January 1942,  Yorktown  and her consorts covered the movement of marines to  Tutuila  and  Pago Pago  to augment the garrison already there.   Having safely covered that troop movement,  Yorktown , in company with sister ship  Enterprise , departed Samoan waters on 25 January. Six days later, TF8 (built around  Enterprise ), and TF17 (around  Yorktown ) parted company. The former headed for the  Marshall Islands , the latter for the  Gilberts , each to take part in some of the first American offensives of the war, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids.   At 05:17,  Yorktown  - screened by  USS  Louisville  (CA-28)  and  USS  St. Louis  (CL-49)  and four destroyers - launched 11 Douglas  TBD-1 Devastators  and 17 Douglas  SBD-3 Dauntlesses , under the command of Comdr.  Curtis W. Smiley . Those planes hit what Japanese shore installations and shipping they could find at  Jaluit , but severe thunderstorms hampered the mission, and seven planes were lost. Other  Yorktown  planes attacked Japanese installations and ships at  Makin  and  Mili  Atolls.   The attack on the Gilberts by TF17 had apparently been a complete surprise since the American force encountered no enemy surface ships. A single four-engined  Kawanishi H6K  ""Mavis"" patrol flying boat attempted to attack American destroyers sent astern in hope of recovering the crews of planes overdue from the Jaluit mission. Antiaircraft fire from the destroyers drove off the intruder before he could cause any damage.   Later, another ""Mavis""-or possibly the same one-came out of low clouds 15,000 yards (14,000 m) distant from  Yorktown . The carrier withheld her antiaircraft fire in order not to interfere with the  combat air patrol  (CAP) fighters. Presently, the ""Mavis"", pursued by two  F4F Wildcats , disappeared behind a cloud. Within five minutes, the enemy patrol plane fell out of the clouds and crashed in the water.   Although TF17 was slated to make a second attack on Jaluit, it was canceled because of heavy rainstorms and the approach of darkness. Therefore, the  Yorktown  force retired from the area.   Admiral  Chester Nimitz  later called the Marshalls-Gilberts raids ""well conceived, well planned, and brilliantly executed."" The results obtained by TFs 8 and 17 were noteworthy, Nimitz continued in his subsequent report, because the task forces had been obliged to make their attacks somewhat blindly, due to lack of hard intelligence data on the Japanese-mandated islands.   Yorktown  subsequently put in at Pearl Harbor for replenishment before she put to sea on 14 February, bound for the  Coral Sea . On 6 March, she rendezvoused with TF11 - formed around  Lexington  and under the command of Rear Admiral  Wilson Brown  - and headed towards  Rabaul  and  Gasmata  to attack Japanese shipping there in an effort to check the Japanese advance and to cover the landing of Allied troops at  Nouma ,  New Caledonia . However, as the two carriers - screened by a powerful force of eight heavy cruisers (including the Australian  HMAS  Australia  and 14 destroyers - steamed toward  New Guinea , the Japanese continued their advance toward Australia with a landing on 7 March at the  Huon Gulf , in the  Salamaua - Lae  area on the eastern end of New Guinea.   Word of the Japanese operation prompted Admiral Brown to change the objective of TF11's strike from Rabaul to the Salamaua-Lae sector. On the morning of 10 March 1942, American carriers launched aircraft from the  Gulf of Papua .  Lexington  flew off her air group commencing at 07:49 and, 21 minutes later,  Yorktown  followed suit. While the choice of the gulf as the launch point for the strike meant the planes would have to fly some 125 miles (201 km) across the  Owen Stanley mountains  - a range not known for the best flying conditions - that approach provided security for the task force and ensured surprise.   In the attacks that followed,  Lexington's  SBDs from Scouting Squadron 2 (VS-2) commenced dive-bombing Japanese ships at Lae at 0922. The carrier's torpedo and bomber squadrons (VT-2 and VB-2) attacked shipping at Salamaua at 09:38. Her fighters (VF-2) split up into four-plane attack groups: one strafed Lae and the other, Salamaua.  Yorktown's  planes followed on the heels of those from ""Lady Lex."" VB-5 and VT-5 attacked Japanese ships in the Salamaua area at 0950, while VS-5 went after auxiliaries moored close in shore at Lae. The fighters of VF-42 flew CAP over Salamaua until they determined there was no air opposition, then strafed surface objectives and small boats in the harbor.   After carrying out their missions, the American planes returned to their carriers, and 103 planes of the 104 launched were back safely on board by noon. One SBD-2 had been downed by Japanese antiaircraft fire. The raid on Salamaua and Lae was the first attack by many pilots of both carriers; and, while the resultant torpedo and bombing accuracy was inferior to that achieved in later actions, the operation gave the fliers invaluable experience which enabled them to do so well in the  Battle of the Coral Sea  and the Battle of Midway.          The  Yorktown  is refueled by the  USS  Brazos  (AO-4)  mid-Pacific in July 1940.       Task Force 11 retired at 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) on a southeasterly course until dark, when the ships steered eastward at 15 knots (17 mph; 28 km/h) and made rendezvous with  Task Group 11.7  (TG11.7), four  heavy cruisers  and four destroyers under the Australian Rear Admiral  John Crace , which provided cover for the carriers on their approach to New Guinea.   Yorktown  resumed her patrols in the Coral Sea area, remaining at sea into April, out of reach of Japanese land-based aircraft and ready to carry out offensive operations whenever the opportunity presented itself. After the Lae-Salamaua raid, the situation in the South Pacific seemed temporarily stabilized, and  Yorktown  and her consorts in TF17 put in to the undeveloped harbor at  Tongatapu , in the  Tonga  Islands, for needed upkeep, having been at sea continuously since departing from Pearl Harbor on 14 February.   However, the enemy was soon on the move. To Admiral Nimitz, there seemed to be ""excellent indications that the Japanese intended to make a seaborne attack on  Port Moresby  the first week in May.""  Yorktown  accordingly departed Tongatapu on 27 April 1942, bound once more for the Coral Sea. TF11 - now commanded by Rear Admiral  Aubrey W. Fitch , who had relieved Brown in  Lexington  - departed Pearl Harbor to join Fletcher's TF 17 and arrived in the vicinity of  Yorktown's  group, southwest of the  New Hebrides  Islands, on 1 May.     [ edit ]   Battle of the Coral Sea       Main article:  Battle of the Coral Sea       At 15:17 the next afternoon, two Dauntlesses from VS-5 sighted a Japanese submarine, running on the surface. Three Devastators took off from  Yorktown , sped to the scene, and carried out an attack that only succeeded in driving the submarine under.   On the morning of 3 May, TF11 and TF17 were some 100 miles (200 km) apart, engaged in fueling operations. Shortly before midnight, Fletcher received word from Australian-based aircraft that Japanese transports were disembarking troops and equipment at  Tulagi  in the  Solomon Islands . Arriving soon after the Australians had evacuated the place, the Japanese landed to commence construction of a seaplane base there to support their southward thrust.   Yorktown  accordingly set course northward at 27 knots (31 mph; 50 km/h). By daybreak on 4 May, she was within striking distance of the newly established Japanese beachhead and launched her first strike at 0701-18 F4F-3's of VF-42, 12 TBD's of VT-5, and 28 SBD's from VS and BY-5.  Yorktown's  air group made three consecutive attacks on enemy ships and shore installations at Tulagi and  Gavutu  on the south coast of  Florida Island  in the Solomons. Expending 22 torpedoes and 76 1,000 pound bombs in the three attacks,  Yorktown's  planes sank the destroyer  Kikuzuki , three minecraft and four barges. In addition, Air Group 5 destroyed five enemy seaplanes, all at the cost of two F4F's lost (the pilots were recovered) and one TBD (whose crew was lost).   Meanwhile, that same day, TF 44, a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Admiral Crace (RN), joined  Lexington's  TF11, thus completing the composition of the Allied force on the eve of the crucial Battle of the Coral Sea.   Elsewhere, to the northward, eleven troop-laden transports - escorted by destroyers and covered by the light carrier  Shh , four heavy cruisers, and a destroyer - steamed toward Port Moresby. In addition, another Japanese task force - formed around the two Pearl Harbor veterans, carriers  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku , and screened by two heavy cruisers and six destroyers - provided additional air cover.   On the morning of 6 May, Fletcher gathered all Allied forces under his tactical command as TF17. At daybreak on the 7th, he dispatched Crace, with the cruisers and destroyers under his command, toward the  Louisiade  archipelago to intercept any enemy attempt to move toward Port Moresby.   While Fletcher moved north with his two flattops and their screens in search of the enemy, Japanese search planes located the oiler  USS  Neosho  (AO-23)  and her escort,  USS  Sims  (DD-409)  and misidentified the former as a carrier. Two waves of Japanese planes  first high level bombers and then dive bombers  attacked the two ships.  Sims , her antiaircraft battery crippled by gun failures, took three direct hits and sank quickly with a heavy loss of life.  Neosho  was more fortunate in that, even after seven direct hits and eight near-misses, she remained afloat until, on the 11th, her survivors were picked up by  USS  Henley  (DD-391)  and her hulk sunk by the rescuing destroyer.   Neosho  and  Sims  had performed a valuable service, drawing off the planes that might otherwise have hit Fletcher's carriers. Meanwhile,  Yorktown  and  Lexington's  planes found  Shh  and sunk her. One of  Lexington's  pilots reported this victory with the radio message, ""Scratch one flattop"".   That afternoon,  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku  - still not located by Fletcher's forces - launched 27 bombers and torpedo planes to search for the American ships. Their flight proved uneventful until they ran into fighters from  Yorktown  and  Lexington , who proceeded to down nine enemy planes in the ensuing dogfight.   Near twilight, three Japanese planes incredibly mistook  Yorktown  for their own carrier and attempted to land. The ship's gunfire, though, drove them off; and the enemy planes crossed  Yorktown' s bow and turned away out of range. Twenty minutes later, when three more enemy pilots made the mistake of trying to get into  Yorktown's  landing circle, the carrier's gunners splashed one of the trio.   However, the battle was far from over. The next morning, 8 May, a  Lexington  search plane spotted Admiral  Takeo Takagi 's carrier striking force - including  Zuikaku  and  Shkaku .  Yorktown  planes scored two bomb hits on  Shkaku , damaging her flight deck and preventing her from launching aircraft; in addition, the bombs set off explosions in gasoline storage tanks and destroyed an engine repair workshop.  Lexington' s Dauntlesses added another hit. Between the two American air groups, the hits killed 108 Japanese sailors and wounded 40 more.   While the American planes were occupying the Japanese flattops, however,  Yorktown  and  Lexington  - alerted by an intercepted message which indicated that the Japanese knew of their whereabouts - were preparing to fight off a retaliatory strike, which came shortly after 11:00.   American CAP Wildcats downed 17 planes, though some managed to slip through the defenses.  ""Kates""  launched torpedoes from both sides of  Lexington's  bows. Two ""fish"" tore into ""Lady Lex"" on the port side;  ""Val""   dive bombers  added to the destruction with three bomb hits.  Lexington  developed a list, with three partially-flooded engineering spaces. Several fires raged below decks, and the carrier's elevators were put out of commission.   Meanwhile  Yorktown  was having problems of her own. Maneuvered by Captain  Elliott Buckmaster , her commanding officer, the carrier dodged eight torpedoes. Attacked then by ""Vals"", the ship managed to evade all but one bomb. That one, however, penetrated the flight deck and exploded below decks, killing or seriously injuring 66 men.   Lexington's  damage control parties brought the fires under control, and the ship was still able to continue flight operations despite the damage. The air battle itself ended shortly before noon on the 8th; within an hour, the carrier was on an even keel, although slightly down by the bow. However, an explosion caused by the ignition of gasoline vapors later caused a fire and tore apart the inside.  Lexington  was abandoned at 1707, and later sunk by  USS  Phelps  (DD-361) .   The Japanese had won a tactical victory, inflicting comparatively heavier losses on the Allied force, but the Allies, in stemming the tide of Japan's conquests in the South and Southwest Pacific, had achieved a strategic victory.  Yorktown  had not achieved her part in the victory without cost, and had suffered enough damage to cause experts to estimate that at least three months in a yard would be required to put her back in fighting trim. However, there was little time for repairs, because Allied intelligence - most notably the cryptographic unit at Pearl Harbor - had gained enough information from decoded Japanese naval messages to estimate that the Japanese were on the threshold of a major operation aimed at the northwestern tip of the Hawaiian chain - two islets in a low coral atoll known as  Midway .     [ edit ]   Battle of Midway       Main article:  Battle of Midway               Yorktown  in drydock shortly before the Battle of Midway       Armed with this intelligence Admiral Nimitz began methodically planning Midway's defense, rushing all possible reinforcement in the way of men, planes and guns to Midway. In addition, he began gathering his naval forces - comparatively meager as they were - to meet the enemy at sea. As part of those preparations, he recalled TF16,  Enterprise  and  Hornet  (CV-8), to Pearl Harbor for a quick replenishment.   Yorktown , too, received orders to return to Hawaii; and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 May. Performing a seeming miracle, yard workers there - laboring around the clock - made enough repairs to enable the ship to put to sea. Her air group - for the most part experienced but weary - was augmented by planes and crews from  Saratoga  (CV-3) which was then headed for Hawaiian waters after her modernization on the west coast. Ready for battle,  Yorktown  sailed as the core of TF17 on 30 May.   Northeast of Midway,  Yorktown , flying Rear Admiral Fletcher's flag, rendezvoused with TF16 under Rear Admiral  Raymond A. Spruance  and maintained a position 10 miles (20 km) to the northward of him.   Patrols, both from Midway itself and from the carriers, proceeded apace during those days in early June. On the morning of the 4th as dawn began to streak the eastern sky,  Yorktown  launched a 10-plane group of Dauntlesses from VB-5 which searched a northern semicircle for a distance of 100 miles (200 km) out but found nothing.   Meanwhile,  PBYs  flying from Midway had sighted the approaching Japanese and broadcast the alarm for the American forces defending the key atoll. Admiral Fletcher, in tactical command, ordered Admiral Spruance's TF16 to locate the enemy carrier force and strike them as soon as they were found.   Yorktown's  search group returned at 0830, landing soon after the last of the six-plane CAP had left the deck. When the last of the Dauntlesses were recovered, the deck was hastily respotted for the launch of the ship's attack group - 17 Dauntlesses from VB-3; 12 Devastators from VT-3, and six Wildcats from ""Fighting Three.""  Enterprise  and  Hornet , meanwhile, launched their attack groups.   The torpedo planes from the three American carriers located the Japanese striking force, but met disaster. Of the 41 planes from VT-8, VT-6, and VT-3, only six returned to  Enterprise  and  Yorktown , collectively. None made it back to  Hornet .   The destruction of the torpedo planes, however, had served a purpose. The Japanese CAP had broken off their high-altitude cover for their carriers and had concentrated on the Devastators, flying ""on the deck."" The skies above were thus left open for Dauntlesses arriving from  Yorktown  and  Enterprise .   Virtually unopposed,  Yorktown's  dive-bombers pummeled  Japanese aircraft carrier  Sry , making three lethal hits with 1,000 pound bombs, turning her into an inferno. [ 2 ]   Enterprise's  planes, meanwhile, hit  Japanese aircraft carrier  Akagi  and  Japanese aircraft carrier  Kaga  - turning them, too into wrecks in short order. The bombs from the Dauntlesses caught all of the Japanese carriers in the midst of refueling and rearming operations, and the combination of bombs and gasoline proved explosive and disastrous to the Japanese.   Three Japanese carriers had been lost. A fourth however, still roamed at large -  Japanese aircraft carrier  Hiry . Separated from her sisters, she launched a striking force of 18 ""Vals"" and soon located  Yorktown .          Smoke pours from  Yorktown  after being hit in the boilers by Japanese dive bombers at Midway.       As soon as the attackers had been picked up on  Yorktown' s radar at about 1329, she discontinued fueling her CAP fighters on deck and swiftly cleared for action. Her returning dive bombers were moved from the landing circle to open the area for antiaircraft fire. The Dauntlesses were ordered aloft to form a CAP. An auxiliary gasoline tank - of 800 gallons capacity - was pushed over the carrier's fantail, eliminating one fire hazard. The crew drained fuel lines and closed and secured all compartments.   All of  Yorktown' s fighters were vectored out to intercept the oncoming Japanese aircraft, and did so some 15 to 20 miles (30 km) out. The Wildcats attacked vigorously, breaking up what appeared to be an organized attack by some 18 ""Vals"" and 18 ""Zeroes."" ""Planes were flying in every direction"", wrote Captain Buckmaster after the action, ""and many were falling in flames."" The leader of the ""Vals"", Lieutenant Joichi Tomonaga, was probably shot down by the  VF-3 's commanding officer,  Lieutenant Commander  John S. Thach. [1] .   Despite an intensive barrage and evasive maneuvering, three ""Vals"" scored hits. Two of them were shot down soon after releasing their bomb loads; the third went out of control just as his bomb left the rack. It tumbled in flight and hit just abaft number two elevator on the starboard side, exploding on contact and blasting a hole about 10 feet (3 m) square in the flight deck. Splinters from the exploding bomb decimated the crews of the two 1.1-inch (28 mm) gun mounts aft of the island and on the flight deck below. Fragments piercing the flight deck hit three planes on the hangar deck, starting fires. One of the aircraft, a  Yorktown  Dauntless, was fully fueled and carrying a 1,000 pound bomb. Prompt action by Lt. A. C. Emerson, the hangar deck officer, prevented a serious conflagration by activating the sprinkler system and quickly extinguishing the fire.   The second bomb to hit the ship came from the port side, pierced the flight deck, and exploded in the lower part of the  funnel . It ruptured the uptakes for three boilers, disabled two boilers themselves, and extinguished the fires in five boilers. Smoke and gases began filling the firerooms of six boilers. The men at number one boiler, however, remained at their post despite their danger and discomfort and kept its fire going, maintaining enough steam pressure to allow the auxiliary steam systems to function.   A third bomb hit the carrier from the starboard side, pierced the side of number one elevator and exploded on the fourth deck, starting a persistent fire in the rag storage space, adjacent to the forward gasoline stowage and the magazines. The prior precaution of smothering the gasoline system with carbon dioxide undoubtedly prevented the gasoline from igniting.   While the ship recovered from the damage inflicted by the dive-bombing attack, her speed dropped to six knots; and then at 14:40, about 20 minutes after the bomb hit that had shut down most of the boilers,  Yorktown  slowed to a stop, dead in the water.   At about 15:40,  Yorktown  prepared to get steaming again; and, at 1550, the engine room force reported that they were ready to make 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) or better. The ship was not yet out of the fight.   Simultaneously, with the fires controlled sufficiently to warrant the resumption of fueling,  Yorktown  began refueling the fighters then on deck; just then the ship's radar picked up an incoming air group at a distance of 33 miles (53 km). While the ship prepared for battle - again smothering gasoline systems and stopping the fueling of the planes on her flight deck - she vectored four of the six fighters of the CAP in the air to intercept the raiders. Of the 10 fighters on board, eight had as little as 23 gallons of fuel in their tanks. They were launched as the remaining pair of fighters of the CAP headed out to intercept the Japanese planes.           Yorktown  is hit on the port side, amidships, by a Japanese Type 91 aerial torpedo during the mid-afternoon attack by planes from the carrier  Hiryu .       At 16:00, maneuvering  Yorktown  churned forward, making 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h). The fighters she had launched and vectored out to intercept had meanwhile made contact with the enemy.  Yorktown  received reports that the planes were ""Kates."" The Wildcats shot down at least three, but the rest began their approach while the carrier and her escorts mounted a heavy antiaircraft barrage.   Yorktown  maneuvered radically, avoiding at least two torpedoes before another two struck the port side within minutes of each other, the first at 16:20. The carrier had been mortally wounded; she lost power and went dead in the water with a jammed rudder and an increasing list to port.   As the list progressed  Commander   C. E. Aldrich , the damage control officer, reported from central station that, without power, controlling the flooding looked impossible. The engineering officer, Lt. Cdr.  J. F. Delaney , soon reported that all fires were out, but all power was lost and it was impossible to correct the list. Buckmaster ordered Aldrich, Delaney, and their men to secure and lay up on deck to put on life jackets.   The list, meanwhile, continued to increase. When it reached 26 degrees, Buckmaster and Aldrich agreed that capsizing was imminent. ""In order to save as many of the ship's company as possible"", the captain wrote later, he ""ordered the ship to be abandoned.""   Over the next few minutes the crew lowered the wounded into life rafts and struck out for the nearby destroyers and cruisers to be picked up by their boats, abandoning ship in good order. After the evacuation of all wounded, the executive officer, Commander  I. D. Wiltsie , left the ship down a line on the starboard side. Buckmaster, meanwhile, toured the ship one last time, to see if any men remained. After finding no ""live personnel"", Buckmaster lowered himself into the water by means of a line over the stern, by which time water was lapping the port side of the hangar deck.     [ edit ]   Salvage and sinking   After being picked up by the destroyer  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , Buckmaster transferred to  USS  Astoria  (CA-34)  and reported to Rear Admiral Fletcher, who had shifted his flag to the heavy cruiser after the first dive-bombing attack. The two men agreed that a salvage party should attempt to save the ship, since she had stubbornly remained afloat despite the heavy list and imminent danger of capsizing.   While efforts to save  Yorktown  had been proceeding apace, her planes were still in action, joining those from  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in striking the last Japanese carrier -  Hiry  - late that afternoon. Taking four direct hits, the Japanese carrier was soon helpless. She was abandoned by her crew and left to drift out of control.   Yorktown , as it turned out, floated throughout the night. Two men were still alive on board her; one attracted attention by firing a machine gun, heard by the sole attending destroyer,  Hughes . The escort picked up the men, one of whom later died.   Meanwhile, Buckmaster had selected 29 officers and 141 men to return to the ship in an attempt to save her. Five destroyers formed an antisubmarine screen while the salvage party boarded the listing carrier, the fire in the rag storage still smouldering on the morning of the 6th.  USS  Vireo  (AT-144) , summoned from  Pearl and Hermes Reef , soon commenced towing the ship. Progress, though, was painfully slow.   Yorktown' s repair party went on board with a carefully predetermined plan of action to be carried out by men from each department - damage control, gunnery air engineering, navigation, communication, supply and medical. To assist in the work, Lt. Cdr.  Arnold E. True  brought his ship,  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , alongside to starboard, aft, furnishing pumps and electric power.   By mid-afternoon, it looked as if the gamble to save the ship was paying off. The process of reducing topside weight was proceeding well - one 5-inch (127 mm) gun had been dropped over the side, and a second was ready to be cast loose; planes had been pushed over the side; the submersible pumps (powered by electricity provided by  Hammann ) had pumped a lot of water out of the engineering spaces. The efforts of the salvage crew had reduced the list about two degrees.          USS  Hammann  (DD-412) sinking with stern high, after being torpedoed by  Japanese submarine  I-168       Unknown to  Yorktown  and the six nearby destroyers,  Japanese submarine  I-168  had achieved a favorable firing position. Remarkably - but perhaps understandably due to the debris and wreckage in the water in the vicinity - none of the destroyers picked up the approaching I-boat. At 15:36 lookouts spotted a salvo of four torpedoes approaching the ship from the starboard beam.   Hammann  went to general quarters, a 20 millimeter gun going into action in an attempt to explode the torpedoes in the water. One torpedo hit  Hammann  - her screws churning the water beneath her fantail as she tried to get underway - directly amidships and broke her back. The destroyer jackknifed and went down rapidly.   Two torpedoes struck  Yorktown  just below the turn of the bilge at the after end of the island structure. The fourth torpedo passed just astern of the carrier.   About a minute after  Hammann  sank there was an underwater explosion, possibly caused by the destroyer's depth charges going off. The blast killed many of  Hammann's  and a few of  Yorktown's  men who had been thrown into the water. The concussion battered the already-damaged carrier's hull and caused tremendous shocks that carried away  Yorktown's  auxiliary generator, sent numerous fixtures from the hangar deck overhead crashing to the deck below, sheared rivets in the starboard leg of the foremast, and threw men in every direction, causing broken bones and several minor injuries.   All destroyers immediately commenced searches for the enemy submarine (which escaped) and commenced rescuing men from  Hammann  and  Yorktown . Captain Buckmaster decided to postpone further attempts at salvage until the following day.   Vireo  cut the tow and doubled back to  Yorktown  to pick up survivors, taking on board many men of the salvage crew while picking up men from the water. The little ship endured a terrific pounding from the larger ship but nevertheless stayed alongside to carry out her rescue mission. Later, while on board the tug, Buckmaster conducted a burial service, and two officers and an enlisted man from  Hammann  were buried at sea.   The second attempt at salvage was never made. Throughout the night of the 6th and into the morning of the 7th,  Yorktown  remained stubbornly afloat. By 05:30 on 7 June, however, the men in the ships nearby noted that the carrier's list was rapidly increasing to port. At 07:01, the ship turned over onto her port side and sank in 3,000 fathoms (5,500 m) of water, her battle flags flying.     [ edit ]   Honors and rediscovery   Yorktown  (CV-5) earned three  battle stars  for her World War II service, two of them for the significant part she had played in stopping Japanese expansion and turning the tide of the war at Coral Sea and at Midway.   On 19 May 1998, the wreck of  Yorktown  was found and photographed by renowned oceanographer Dr.  Robert D. Ballard , discoverer of the wreck of the  RMS  Titanic . The wreck, 3 miles (5 km) beneath the surface, was surprisingly intact after having been on the sea bottom since 1942much paint and equipment were still visible.

Its 18,049 agents (projected to be over 20,000 by the end of 2009 [ 1 ] ) are primarily responsible for immigration and border law enforcement as codified in the  Immigration and Nationality Act . Their duty is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States and to deter, detect, and apprehend illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who enter the United States other than through designated ports of entry.

The inspectors, usually called ""mounted guards"", operated out of  El Paso, Texas . Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as  California  trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.   In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as ""mounted inspectors"". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the  National Origins Act  and  Chinese Exclusion Act  of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times.  U.S. Army  troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to ""the more serious work of military training."" Non-nationals encountered illegally in the U.S. by the army were directed to the immigration inspection stations.  Texas Rangers  were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as ""singularly effective"".   The Border Patrol was founded on  May 28 ,  1924  as an agency of the  United States Department of Labor  to prevent  illegal entries  along the  MexicoUnited States border . Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to insure that non-American crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the  Eastern Seaboard  during the sixties when Cuba came under dictatorial control and entertained ideas of establishing USSR missile bases there.   Prior to 2003, the Border Patrol was part of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS), an agency that was within the  U.S. Department of Justice . INS was disbanded in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP,  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .   The priority mission of the Border Patrol, as a result of the  9/11 attacks  and its merging into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent  terrorists  and terrorist weapons from entering the  United States of America . However, the Border Patrol's traditional mission remains as the deterrence, detection and apprehension of  illegal immigrants  and individuals involved in the  illegal drug trade  who generally enter the United States other than through designated  ports of entry . The Border Patrol also operates 33 permanent  interior checkpoints  along the southern border of the United States.   Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol employs over 17,600 agents (as of the end of fiscal year 2008), [ 2 ]  who are specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents are assigned primarily to the  MexicoUnited States border , where they are assigned to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.  [ 3 ]  Patrols on horseback have made a comeback since smugglers have been pushed into the more remote mountainous regions, which are hard to cover with modern tracking strategies. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Strategy     [ edit ]   1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement          Border Patrol Agents with a  HMMWV  and  Astar  patrol for illegal entry into U.S.       The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal immigrants. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal immigrants to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as ""employer sanctions"". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the  Livermore Sector  in Northern California.   Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed  Proposition 187 , denying benefits to illegal immigrants and criminalizing illegal immigrants in possession of forged green cards, I.D. cards and Social Security Numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal immigrants to the  INS . Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.     [ edit ]   Deterrence becomes the new strategy          A U.S. Border Patrol  Ford F-250  pick-up truck at the Tijuana-San Ysidro border crossing. Seen behind the truck is the U.S.-Mexico border fence.       In response to illegal immigration in 1994, the Border Patrol came up with a new strategy for addressing illegal immigrants. In 1992, ""over half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600 border miles13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles (8.0 km) along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico."" [ 5 ]  In 1991,  Office of National Drug Control Policy  commissioned  Sandia National Laboratory  to study more effective ways of stopping the flow of aliens and drugs into the United States. The ""Sandia Study"" concluded that the Border Patrol's traditional method of apprehension was ineffective. The Sandia Study recommended deterrence and the use of technology (cameras) and infrastructure (fences and other barriers) to control illegal immigration and drug smuggling. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Southern border     [ edit ]   El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line   El Paso  Sector Chief Patrol Agent (and future U.S. congressman)  Silvestre Reyes  started a program called ""Operation Hold the Line"". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to  illegal entries  resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande River, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.     [ edit ]   San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper          A Border Patrol  Jeep  stands watch over the  U.S.-Mexico border  at  San Ysidro, California .       San Diego Sector tried  Silvestre Reyes ' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector. [ citation needed ]  In addition, Congressman  Duncan Hunter  obtained surplus military landing mats to use as a border fence. [ citation needed ]  Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. [ citation needed ]  Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as people crossed in different regions.     [ edit ]   Tucson Sector's Operation Safeguard   California was no longer the hotbed of illegal entry and the traffic shifted to Arizona, primarily in  Nogales  and  Douglas . [ citation needed ]  The Border Patrol instituted the same deterrent strategy it used in San Diego to Arizona.     [ edit ]   Northern border   In 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 340 agents assigned along the  Canada  United States border  border. Northern border staffing had been increased to 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a six-fold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.   The northern border sectors are Blaine (Washington), Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Havre (Montana), Houlton (Maine), Spokane (Washington), and Swanton (Vermont).     [ edit ]   Border Patrol moves away from interior enforcement   In the 1990s, Congress mandated that the Border Patrol shift agents away from the interior and focus them on the borders.   After the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the Department of Homeland Security created two immigration enforcement agencies out of the defunct  Immigration and Naturalization Service :  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) and the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal immigrants, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing illegal entries between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP itself is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal authority absolutely nationwide.   In July 2004, the Livermore Sector of the United States Border Patrol was closed. Livermore Sector served Northern California and included stations at  Dublin  ( Parks Reserve Forces Training Area ),  Sacramento ,  Stockton ,  Fresno  and  Bakersfield . The Border Patrol also closed other stations in the interior of the United States including  Roseburg, Oregon  and  Little Rock, Arkansas ]. The Border Patrol functions in these areas consisted largely of local jail and transportation terminal checks for illegal immigrants. These functions were turned over to  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .     [ edit ]   The new strategy          Cameras add ""Smart Border"" surveillance.       In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy. [ 7 ]  The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives:     Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States;   Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement;   Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband;   Use ""smart border"" technology; and   Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.       [ edit ]   Capabilities   The border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by  unmanned aerial vehicles . [ 8 ]   The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is ""Line Watch"". Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities. [ 9 ]   Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics. [ 10 ]   Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft. [ 11 ]   Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components. [ 12 ]   Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch. [ 13 ]  Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.     [ edit ]   Expansion   Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995-2001 attrition spiked to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was doing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely due to agents transferring to the  Federal Air Marshals  after  9/11 . Since that time the attrition problem has decreased significantly and Congress has increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from GS-9 to GS-11 in the  General Schedule  in 2002. In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4%. [ 14 ]   The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004 (signed by President Bush on  December 17 ,  2004 ) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, ""subject to appropriation"". This authorization, if fully implemented, would nearly double the Border Patrol manpower from 11,000 to 21,000 agents by 2010.   In July 2005, Congress signed the  Emergency Supplemental Spending Act  for military operations in Iraq/Afghanistan and other operations. The act also appropriated funding to increase Border Patrol manpower by 500 Agents. In October 2005, President Bush also signed the DHS FY06 Appropriation bill, funding an additional 1,000 Agents.   In November 2005, President George W. Bush made a trip to southern Arizona to discuss more options that would decrease illegal crossings at the U.S. and Mexican border. In his proposed fiscal year 2007 budget he has requested an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents.   The Secure Fence Act, signed by President George W. Bush on  October 26 ,  2006 , has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the 1,945-mile (3,130 km) border, but the act requires only 700 miles (1,100 km) of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence. [ 17 ]  ) Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area. [ 18 ]  Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected due to the fact that a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy. [ 19 ]   Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande River be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.

Recruits are instructed in Border Patrol and federal law enforcement subjects.   Border Patrol courses include: Immigration and Nationality Law, Criminal Law and Statutory Authority, Spanish, Border Patrol Operations, Care and Use of Firearms, Physical Training, Operation of Motor Vehicles, and Anti-Terrorism.   FLETC courses include: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law. [ 22 ]   The physical aspects of the Border Patrol Training Program are extremely demanding. At the end of 55 days, trainees must be able to complete a one and a half mile run in 13 minutes or less, a confidence course in two and a half minutes or less, and a 220 yard dash in 46 seconds or less. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Uniforms   The Border Patrol currently wears the following types of uniforms:          CBP officers at a ceremony in 2007         Dress uniform  The dress uniform consists of  olive green  trousers with a blue stripe, and an olive green shirt, which may or may not have blue shoulder straps. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Ceremonial uniform  When required, the following items are added to the dress uniform to complete the ceremonial uniform: olive green  Ike jacket  or  tunic  with blue accents ( shoulder straps  and  cuffs , blue tie, brass tie tack, white gloves, and olive green felt  campaign hat  with leather hat band. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Rough duty uniform  The rough duty uniform is comprised of dark green work trousers and dark green work shirt (in short or long sleeves). Usually worn with green  baseball cap  or tan  stetson .   Accessories, footwear, and outerwear  Additional items are worn in matching dark green, blue, or black colors as appropriate.   Organization patches  The Border Patrol wears two:    The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a ""keystone"" shape. A ""keystone"" is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.   Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.         The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb. [ 24 ]  Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by ightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

This Award is bestowed to Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty. It is also presented to agents for extraordinary contributions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.   This award is named for Border Patrol Inspectors Newton [ 25 ]  and Azrak, [ 26 ]  who were murdered by two drug smugglers in San Diego County in 1967.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).   Like other law enforcement agencies, the  Remington 870  is the standard shotgun.   Border Patrol Agents also commonly carry the  M4 Carbine  and the  H&K UMP  40 cal.     [ edit ]   Transportation          USBP Air and Marine Intrepid and SafeBoat vessels with a UH-1 Huey near San Diego, Calif.       Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates several thousand  SUVs  and  pickup trucks , which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. This vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as speed radar,  breathalyzers , and emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the  Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor  or the  Dodge Charger  as patrol cars or high speed ""interceptors"" on highways. The Border Patrol also operates  ATVs ,  motorcycles ,  snowmobiles , small boats,  helicopters , and  light aircraft .   Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle or a broad green diagonal stripe on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white.   The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. The  U.S. Border Patrol  has 205 horses As of 2005 [update] . Most are employed along the  MexicoUnited States border . In  Arizona , these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

The film claimed that this is due to the lack of judicial powers of the Border Patrol and the effective hamstringing of the agency by the  federal government . The film interviews people that deal with illegal immigration on a daily basis, as well as local  citizens  living in the border areas.     [ edit ]   Allegations of abuse     There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the  Houston Journal of International Law  (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the ""serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public"" and that ""illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents"". [ 35 ]       In 1998,  Amnesty International  investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service , and particularly the  Border Patrol . Their report said they found indications of  human rights  violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998. [ 36 ]       An article in  Journal  by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the ""vast majority"" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as ""verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."" [ 37 ]       [ edit ]   Corruption   Incidences of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include:     Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal immigrant, three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document. [ 38 ]  He plead guilty. [ 39 ]   Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal immigrant for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol agent. [ 40 ]   Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose  girlfriend  was an illegal immigrant, he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation. [ 40 ]   Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal immigrant [ 41 ]  who used a fake  birth certificate  to get into the Border Patrol admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal immigrants into the U.S., some of them in his government truck, [ 42 ]  and was helping to smuggle illegal immigrants and charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle immigrants.   An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wire tap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 immigrants at a time. [ 41 ]       [ edit ]   National Border Patrol Council   National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the  labor union  which represents over 14,000 Border Patrol Agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded in 1967, and its parent organization is the  American Federation of Government Employees ,  AFL-CIO . The NBPC's executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol Agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the  Peace Officer Research Association  of  Californias Legal Defense Fund .

According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic was inefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control the border. In addition, the authors said the only good border control strategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border. The study concluded that the way to prevent  illegal entry  is to impose ""effective barriers on the free flow of traffic."" The study noted that where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the United States, they should be stopped at the earliest opportunity. In addition, the Sandia study concluded that ""control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained"" and recommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics from apprehending illegal immigrants after they have entered the United States to preventing illegal entry into the United States.   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^  Nunez-Neto, Blas, Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol, Congressional Research Service, Updated  January 25 ,  2006 ,  [3] , Page 35   ^  Coyle, Marcia.""Waivers for border fence challenged: Environmental groups take their complaints to Supreme Court.""

""The data compiled in this report suggest that law enforcement in the southwest region of the United States may be verging on lawlessness. This statement receives fuller support from announcements emanating from the INS. In December 1997, John Chase, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the ""vast majority"" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region. Over 2,300 complaints were filed in 1997 as opposed to the 1,813 complaints filed in 1996. Another 400 reports of ""minor misconduct"" were placed in a new category. Chase was quick to emphasize, however, that the 243 ""serious"" allegations of abuse and use of excessive force that could warrant criminal prosecution were down in 1997, as compared with the 328 in 1996. These ""serious"" cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as ""verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause.""   ^  Border agent accused of hiding an illegal entrant  June 23, 2005   ^  Border agent pleads guilty to harboring illegal entrant  September 22, 2005   ^  a   b  U.S. border agent indicted  March 11, 2005   ^  a   b  who became a Border agent, also said to be smuggler  August 5, 2005   ^  Border Agent Gets 5 Years for Smuggling  July 28, 2006   ^   http://www.nbpc.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=42         [ edit ]   See also           United States portal                 Law enforcement/Law enforcement topics portal           List of United States federal law enforcement agencies   Border control   Ignacio Ramos   Illegal immigration   H.R. 4437   Minuteman Project   MQ-9 Reaper   No More Deaths   Office of CBP Air   United States Mexico barrier   United States-Canadian Border   la migra       [ edit ]   External links     Official US Border Patrol website     US Border Patrol history   National Border Patrol Strategy (PDF)       Border Patrol official recruiting page   Border Patrol Supervisor's Association (BPSA)   Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty   Large Border Patrol site   Border Patrol Museum official site   National Border Patrol Council official site   National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers   Friends of the Border Patrol   Congressional Research Service (CRS) Reports regarding the U.S. Border Patrol   Civilian Border Patrol Organizations: An Overview and History of the Phenomenon by the   Congressional Research Service .

Cmdr.  ""Jimmy"" Flatley  in his F6F-3 Hellcat before takeoff.       USS  Yorktown  (CV/CVA/CVS-10)  is one of 24  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  built during  World War II  for the  United States Navy . She is named after the  Battle of Yorktown  of the  American Revolutionary War , and is the the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Initially to have been named  Bon Homme Richard , she was renamed  Yorktown  while under construction to commemorate  USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) , lost at the  Battle of Midway  in June 1942.  Yorktown  was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the  Pacific Theater of Operations , earning 11  battle stars  and the  Presidential Unit Citation .   Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950's as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the  Korean War  but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the  Vietnam War , in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career she was used in the movie  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor , and also served as a recovery ship for the  Apollo 8  space mission.   Yorktown  was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a  museum ship  at  Patriot's Point ,  Mount Pleasant, South Carolina . She is a  National Historic Landmark .

She was renamed on 26 September 1942, and launched on 21 January 1943, sponsored by  Eleanor Roosevelt .  Yorktown  was  commissioned  on 15 April 1943. with  Captain  Joseph J. Clark in command.     [ edit ]   Service History     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   1943   Yorktown  remained in the  Naval Station Norfolk  area until 21 May, at which time she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of  Trinidad . She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited  Chesapeake Bay  on her way to the  Pacific Ocean . She transited the  Panama Canal  on 11 July and departed  Balboa, Panama , on 12 July. The warship arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the  Hawaiian Islands . On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her  task force , TF 15, arrived at the launching point about 128 miles (206 km) from  Marcus Island  early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.   On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the  West Coast of the United States . She arrived in  San Francisco  on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor.  Yorktown  returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on  Japanese  installations on  Wake Island . After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii.  Yorktown  arrived at  Oahu  on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.   On 10 November,  Yorktown  departed Pearl Harbor in company with  Task Force 50 the  Fast Carrier Task Force ,  Pacific Fleet to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of certain of the  Gilbert Islands . On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near  Jaluit  and  Mili  and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on  Tarawa ,  Abemama , and  Makin . The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at  Wotje  and  Kwajalein  Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.     [ edit ]   1944   On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault Operation Flintlock , the  Marshall Islands  invasion. Her task group,  Task Group 58.1 , arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, and its carriers Yorktown ,  Lexington , and  Cowpens began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on  Maloelap  Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on  Majuro  and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January,  Yorktown  and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January,  Yorktown  aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the Yorktown air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.   Over the next four months,  Yorktown  participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the  Marianas  in the north to  New Guinea  in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at  Truk  Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16 February and 17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas and, on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on  Saipan . That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for  Espiritu Santo  in the  New Hebrides . She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30 March and 31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the  Palau Islands ; and, on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of  Woleai . Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.   On 13 April,  Yorktown  returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of  Major General   Douglas MacArthur 's assault on the  Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)  area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the  Wakde - Sarmi  area of northern New Guinea. On 22 April and 23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 April and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May and, for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific.  Yorktown  entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operationthe assault on the Marianas.   On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan.  Yorktown  aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on  Guam . Those raids continued until 13 June, when  Yorktown , with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the  Bonin Islands . That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the  Battle of the Philippine Sea . Task Force 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.   On the morning of 19 June,  Yorktown  aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large  bogey  appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle,  Yorktown {'}s planes continued both to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea,  Yorktown  aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.           Yorktown  in June 1944 with planes of  Carrier Air Group 1       On the morning of 20 June,  Yorktown  steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from  Hornet  spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units.  Yorktown  launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral  Ozawa 's force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after  Zuikaku  on whom they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the  Yorktown  air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese.  Yorktown  returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on  Pagan Island  on 22 June and 23 June. On 24 June, she launched another series of raids on  Iwo Jima . On 25 June, she laid in a course for  Eniwetok  and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3 July and 4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and  Chichi Jima . On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on  Yap ,  Ulithi , and the  Palaus . She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.   On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headedvia Eniwetok and Pearl Harborback to the United States.  Yorktown  arrived in the  Puget Sound Navy Yard  on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the  Alameda Naval Air Station  from 11 October to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 October to 24 October,  Yorktown  arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.   On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the  Philippines  in support of the  Leyte  invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November,  Yorktown  arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of  Luzon  in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous  typhoon  of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers Spence ,  Hull , and  Monaghan and  Yorktown  participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.     [ edit ]   1945   Yorktown  fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in  Formosa  and the Philippines in support of the landings at  Lingayen . The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January 1945 on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January,  Yorktown  and the rest of TF 38 entered the  South China Sea  via  Bashi Channel  to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of  Saigon  and  Tourane Bay ,  Indochina , in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional [ citation needed ]  score44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and  Canton  in  China . The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again also went to  Hong Kong . On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via  Balintang Channel . She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on  Okinawa  on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.   Yorktown  remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the  3rd Fleet  becoming the  5th Fleet  when  Spruance  relieved  Halsey , on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the  Tokyo  area of  Honsh . On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and  Yorktown  aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time  Yorktown  cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February,  Yorktown  aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on  Kysh  before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.   She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kysh, Honsh, and  Shikoku .   The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine  bomber , probably a  Yokosuka P1Y  ""Frances"", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over  Yorktown' s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime,  Yorktown  continued air operations. That afternoon, three  Yokosuka D4Y  ""Judy""  dive-bombers  launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26.  Yorktown , however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.   On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kysh. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single ""Judy"" made an apparent suicide dive on  Yorktown . The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about 60 feet (18 m) from (20 m) portside.   On 30 March,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive  battleship   Yamato  was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive.  Yorktown  and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target.  Air Group 9  aviators claimed several torpedo hits on  Yamato  just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three 500 pound bomb hits on  light cruiser   Yahagi  sunk it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action,  Yorktown  and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her.  Yorktown' s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the  Rykys , but  Yorktown  sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   Yorktown  entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6 June and 7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kysh airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on  Minami Daito Shima . After the second day's strikes,  Yorktown  began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in  San Pedro Bay  at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honsh. After a fueling rendezvous on 11 June and 12 June, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island  Hokkaid . Those strikes lasted from 13 June to 15 June. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 June, at which time her aviators returned to the Tokyo area. From 19 June to 22 June, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 June, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the  Kure  naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 June, and on 27 June and 28 June, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29 June and 30 June, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8 August and 9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honsh and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 August and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and, on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.   From 16 August to 23 August,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honsh where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender on board battleship  Missouri  on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied  prisoners of war  still living in their prison camps. On 16 September,  Yorktown  entered  Tokyo Bay  with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in  Buckner Bay  on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.     [ edit ]   1945  1952          Mothballed  Yorktown  at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1948       After a non-stop voyage,  Yorktown  entered  San Francisco Bay  on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to  Hunters Point Navy Yard  to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in  Apra Harbor  on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to  Samar  in the Philippines, she was diverted to  Manila  en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to  Bremerton, Washington , where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947,  Yorktown  was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Bremerton Group,  Pacific Reserve Fleet .     [ edit ]   1953  1955           Yorktown  after the SCB-27A conversion in 1953       Yorktown  remained in reserve for almost five years. In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at  Puget Sound . On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953,  Yorktown  was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain  William M. Nation  in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in  Yokosuka , Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the  Sea of Japan . The  Korean War  armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,  Yorktown  put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the  Academy Award  nominated short subject documentary film  Jet Carrier . She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 July to 28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.   Yorktown  operated out of the Manila- Subic Bay  area, conducting  7th Fleet  maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the  Christmas  holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of  Nationalist Chinese  from the  Tachen Islands  located near the communist-controlled mainland.  Yorktown  entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23 February and 24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. On 21 March 1955, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at the  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  where she was to receive extensive modificationsmost significantly, an angled  flight deck  to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall and, on 14 October, was placed back in full commission.     [ edit ]   1955  1957   The carrier resumed normal operations along the west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953.  Yorktown  stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the  East China Sea , and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as  Sasebo , Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December.  Yorktown  resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.     [ edit ]   1957  1960   On 1 September 1957, her home port was changed from Alameda to  Long Beach, California , and she was reclassified an  antisubmarine warfare  (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation  CVS-10 . On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at  Bangor, Washington , on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months,  Yorktown  conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 November to 17 November,  Yorktown  continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands,  Quemoy  and  Matsu , held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off  Vietnam  during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the  Taiwan Strait . The remainder of the deploymentsave for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in Marchconsisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at  San Diego  on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.   In January 1960,  Yorktown  headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.     [ edit ]   1961  1964   Yorktown  emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for the Far East. During that deployment, she served as  flagship  for  Carrier Division 19 . She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the  SEATO  ASW exercise,  Operation Sea Serpent . The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.   Yorktown  arrived back in her home port on 18 June and resumed normal operations for the remainder of the year. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.     [ edit ]   1965  1968   The 1964 and 1965, deployment brought  Yorktown  her first real involvement in the  Vietnamese civil war . In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnampresumably ASW services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.   For the remainder of her active career,  Yorktown' s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka on 17 February and joined TF 77 on  Yankee Station  later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing ASW and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several ASW exercises, including the major SEATO exercise,  Operation Sea Imp . The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, headed home on 15 July. She disembarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operationscarrier qualifications and ASW exercisesfor the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.   On 24 February 1967,  Yorktown  entered the  Long Beach Naval Shipyard  for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover  Yorktown  headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled in the wake of the  North Korean  capture of  Pueblo . She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo Japan where she stopped from 19 June to 21 June before heading back to the United States.     [ edit ]   1968  1975          The  Apollo 8  Command Module on the deck of the USS  Yorktown       Yorktown  arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie,  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor . In December 1968, she served as one of the  recovery ships  for the  Apollo 8  space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the  West Indies  until late summer. On 2 September,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise  Operation Peacekeeper . During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and  Yorktown  began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to  Brest, France , and  Rotterdam  in the  Netherlands ,  Yorktown  put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises between 18 October and 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at  Kiel ,  Germany . After that, she stopped at  Copenhagen ,  Denmark , and at  Portsmouth ,  England , before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.   During the first half of 1970,  Yorktown  operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970,  Yorktown  was decommissioned at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group,  Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the  Navy List  on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the  Navy Department  approved the donation of  Yorktown  to the  Patriot's Point Development Authority ,  Charleston, South Carolina . She was towed from  Bayonne, New Jersey , to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

USS  Yorktown  (CV/CVA/CVS-10)  is one of 24  Essex -class   aircraft carriers  built during  World War II  for the  United States Navy . She is named after the  Battle of Yorktown  of the  American Revolutionary War , and is the the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name. Initially to have been named  Bon Homme Richard , she was renamed  Yorktown  while under construction to commemorate  USS  Yorktown  (CV-5) , lost at the  Battle of Midway  in June 1942.  Yorktown  was commissioned in April 1943, and participated in several campaigns in the  Pacific Theater of Operations , earning 11  battle stars  and the  Presidential Unit Citation .   Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950's as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the  Korean War  but served for many years in the Pacific, including duty in the  Vietnam War , in which she earned five battle stars. Late in her career she was used in the movie  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor , and also served as a recovery ship for the  Apollo 8  space mission.   Yorktown  was decommissioned in 1970 and in 1975 became a  museum ship  at  Patriot's Point ,  Mount Pleasant, South Carolina . She is a  National Historic Landmark .

She was renamed on 26 September 1942, and launched on 21 January 1943, sponsored by  Eleanor Roosevelt .  Yorktown  was  commissioned  on 15 April 1943. with  Captain  Joseph J. Clark in command.     [ edit ]   Service History     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   1943   Yorktown  remained in the  Naval Station Norfolk  area until 21 May, at which time she got underway for shakedown training in the vicinity of  Trinidad . She returned to Norfolk on 17 June and began post-shakedown availability. The aircraft carrier completed repairs on 1 July and began air operations out of Norfolk until 6 July, when she exited  Chesapeake Bay  on her way to the  Pacific Ocean . She transited the  Panama Canal  on 11 July and departed  Balboa, Panama , on 12 July. The warship arrived in  Pearl Harbor  on 24 July and began a month of exercises in the  Hawaiian Islands . On 22 August, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first combat of the war. Her  task force , TF 15, arrived at the launching point about 128 miles (206 km) from  Marcus Island  early on the morning of 31 August. She spent most of that day launching fighter and bomber strikes on Marcus Island before beginning the retirement to Hawaii that evening. The aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor on 7 September and remained there for two days.   On 9 September, she stood out to sea, bound for the  West Coast of the United States . She arrived in  San Francisco  on 13 September, loaded aircraft and supplies, and returned to sea on 15 September. Four days later, the aircraft carrier reentered Pearl Harbor.  Yorktown  returned to sea to conduct combat operations on 29 September. Early on the morning of 5 October, she began two days of air strikes on  Japanese  installations on  Wake Island . After retiring to the east for the night, she resumed those air raids early on the morning of 6 October and continued them through most of the day. That evening, the task group began its retirement to Hawaii.  Yorktown  arrived at  Oahu  on 11 October and, for the next month, conducted air training operations out of Pearl Harbor.   On 10 November,  Yorktown  departed Pearl Harbor in company with  Task Force 50 the  Fast Carrier Task Force ,  Pacific Fleet to participate in her first major assault operation, the occupation of certain of the  Gilbert Islands . On 19 November, she arrived at the launch point near  Jaluit  and  Mili  and, early that morning, launched the first of a series of raids to suppress enemy airpower during the amphibious assaults on  Tarawa ,  Abemama , and  Makin . The next day, she sent raids back to the airfield at Jaluit; some of her planes also supported the troops wresting Makin from the Japanese. On 22 November, her air group concentrated upon installations and planes at Mili once again. Before returning to Pearl Harbor, the aircraft carrier made passing raids on the installations at  Wotje  and  Kwajalein  Atolls on 4 December. The warship reentered Pearl Harbor on 9 December and began a month of air training operations in the Hawaiian Islands.     [ edit ]   1944   On 16 January 1944, the warship exited Pearl Harbor once again to support an amphibious assault Operation Flintlock , the  Marshall Islands  invasion. Her task group,  Task Group 58.1 , arrived at its launching point early on the morning of 29 January, and its carriers Yorktown ,  Lexington , and  Cowpens began sending air strikes aloft at about 05:20 for attacks on Taroa airfield located on  Maloelap  Atoll. Throughout the day, her aircraft hit Maloelap in preparation for the assaults on  Majuro  and Kwajalein scheduled for 31 January. On 30 January,  Yorktown  and her sister carriers shifted targets to Kwajalein to begin softening up one of the targets. When the troops stormed ashore on 31 January,  Yorktown  aviators continued their strikes on Kwajalein in support of the troops attacking that atoll. The same employment occupied the Yorktown air group during the first three days in February. On 4 February, however, the task group retired to the fleet anchorage at recently secured Majuro Atoll.   Over the next four months,  Yorktown  participated in a series of raids in which she ranged from the  Marianas  in the north to  New Guinea  in the south. After eight days at Majuro, she sortied with her task group on 12 February to conduct air strikes on the main Japanese anchorage at  Truk  Atoll. Those highly successful raids occurred on 16 February and 17 February. On 18 February, the carrier set a course for the Marianas and, on 22 February, conducted a single day of raids on enemy airfields and installations on  Saipan . That same day, she cleared the area on her way back to Majuro. The warship arrived in Majuro lagoon on 26 February and remained there. On 8 March, the carrier stood out of Majuro, rendezvoused with the rest of TF 58, and shaped a course for  Espiritu Santo  in the  New Hebrides . She reached her destination on 13 March and remained there for 10 days before getting underway for another series of raids on the Japanese middle defense line. On 30 March and 31 March, she launched air strikes on Japanese installations located in the  Palau Islands ; and, on 1 April, her aviators went after the island of  Woleai . Five days later, she returned to her base at Majuro for a week of replenishment and recreation.   On 13 April,  Yorktown  returned to sea once more. On this occasion however, she laid in a course for the northern coast of New Guinea. On 21 April, she began launching raids in support of  Major General   Douglas MacArthur 's assault on the  Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura)  area. That day, her aviators attacked installations in the  Wakde - Sarmi  area of northern New Guinea. On 22 April and 23 April, they shifted to the landing areas at Hollandia themselves and began providing direct support for the assault troops. After those attacks, she retired from the New Guinea coast for another raid on Truk lagoon, which her aircraft carried out on 29 April and 30 April. The aircraft carrier returned to Majuro on 4 May; however, two days later she got underway again, bound for Oahu. The warship entered Pearl Harbor on 11 May and, for the next 18 days, conducted training operations in the Hawaiian Islands. On 29 May, she headed back to the Central Pacific.  Yorktown  entered Majuro lagoon again on 3 June and began preparations for her next major amphibious support operationthe assault on the Marianas.   On 6 June, the aircraft carrier stood out of Majuro with TF 58 and set a course for the Mariana Islands. After five days steaming, she reached the launch point and began sending planes aloft for the preliminary softening up of targets in preparation for the invasion of Saipan.  Yorktown  aircrews concentrated primarily upon airfields located on  Guam . Those raids continued until 13 June, when  Yorktown , with two of the task groups of TF 58, steamed north to hit targets in the  Bonin Islands . That movement resulted in a one-day raid on 16 June before the two task groups headed back to the Marianas to join in the  Battle of the Philippine Sea . Task Force 58 reunited on 18 June and began a short wait for the approaching Japanese Fleet and its aircraft.   On the morning of 19 June,  Yorktown  aircraft began strikes on Japanese air bases on Guam in order to deny them to their approaching carrier-based air and to keep the land-based planes out of the fray. Duels with Guam-based aircraft continued until mid-morning. At about 10:17, however, she got her first indication of the carrier plane attacks when a large  bogey  appeared on her radar screen. At that point she divided her attention, sending part of her air group back to Guam and another portion of it out to meet the raid closing from the west. Throughout the battle,  Yorktown {'}s planes continued both to strike the Guam airfields and intercept the carrier raids. During the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea,  Yorktown  aircraft claimed 37 enemy planes destroyed and dropped 21 tons of bombs on the Guam air bases.           Yorktown  in June 1944 with planes of  Carrier Air Group 1       On the morning of 20 June,  Yorktown  steamed generally west with TF 58 while search planes groped for the fleeing enemy task force. Contact was made with the enemy at about 15:40 when a pilot from  Hornet  spotted the retiring Combined Fleet units.  Yorktown  launched a 40-plane strike between 16:23 and 16:43. Her planes found Admiral  Ozawa 's force at about 18:40 and began a 20-minute attack during which they went after  Zuikaku  on whom they succeeded in scoring some hits. They, however, failed to sink that carrier. They also attacked several other ships in the Japanese force, though no records show a confirmed sinking to the credit of the  Yorktown  air group. On 21 June, the carrier joined in the futile stern chase on the enemy carried out by TF 58 but gave up that evening when air searches failed to contact the Japanese.  Yorktown  returned to the Marianas area and resumed air strikes on  Pagan Island  on 22 June and 23 June. On 24 June, she launched another series of raids on  Iwo Jima . On 25 June, she laid in a course for  Eniwetok  and arrived there two days later. On 30 June, the aircraft carrier headed back to the Marianas and the Bonins. She renewed combat operations on 3 July and 4 July with a series of attacks on Iwo Jima and  Chichi Jima . On 6 July, the warship resumed strikes in the Marianas and continued them for the next 17 days. On 23 July, she headed off to the west for a series of raids on  Yap ,  Ulithi , and the  Palaus . She carried out those attacks on 25 July and arrived back in the Marianas on 29 July.   On 31 July, she cleared the Mariana Islands and headedvia Eniwetok and Pearl Harborback to the United States.  Yorktown  arrived in the  Puget Sound Navy Yard  on 17 August and began a two-month overhaul. She completed repairs on 6 October and departed Puget Sound on 9 October. She stopped at the  Alameda Naval Air Station  from 11 October to 13 October to load planes and supplies and then set a course back to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 18 October to 24 October,  Yorktown  arrived back in Eniwetok on 31 October. She departed the lagoon on 1 November and arrived at Ulithi on 3 November. There, she reported for duty with TG 38.4. The task group left Ulithi on 6 November.   On 7 November, the aircraft carrier changed operational control to TG 38.1 and, for the next two weeks, launched air strikes on targets in the  Philippines  in support of the  Leyte  invasion. Detached from the task force on 23 November,  Yorktown  arrived back in Ulithi on 24 November. She remained there until 10 December, at which time she put to sea to rejoin TF 38. She rendezvoused with the other carriers on 13 December and began launching air strikes on targets on the island of  Luzon  in preparation for the invasion of that island scheduled for the second week in January. On 17 December, the task force began its retirement from the Luzon strikes. During that retirement, TF 38 steamed through the center of the famous  typhoon  of December 1944. That storm sank three destroyers Spence ,  Hull , and  Monaghan and  Yorktown  participated in some of the rescue operations for the survivors of those three destroyers. The warship arrived back in Ulithi on 24 December.     [ edit ]   1945   Yorktown  fueled and provisioned at Ulithi until 30 December, at which time she returned to sea to join TF 38 on strikes at targets in  Formosa  and the Philippines in support of the landings at  Lingayen . The carriers began with raids on airfields on 3 January 1945 on the island of Formosa and continued with various targets for the next week. On 10 January,  Yorktown  and the rest of TF 38 entered the  South China Sea  via  Bashi Channel  to begin a series of raids on Japan's inner defenses. On 12 January, her planes visited the vicinity of  Saigon  and  Tourane Bay ,  Indochina , in hopes of catching major units of the Japanese fleet. Though foiled in their primary desire, TF 38 aviators still managed to rack up an exceptional [ citation needed ]  score44 enemy ships, of which 15 were combatants. On 15 January, raids were launched on Formosa and  Canton  in  China . The following day, her aviators struck at Canton again also went to  Hong Kong . On 20 January, she exited the South China Sea with TF 38 via  Balintang Channel . She participated in a raid on Formosa on 21 January and another on  Okinawa  on 22 January before clearing the area for Ulithi. On the morning of 26 January, she re-entered Ulithi lagoon with TF 38.   Yorktown  remained at Ulithi arming, provisioning, and conducting upkeep until 10 February. At that time, she sortied with TF 58, the  3rd Fleet  becoming the  5th Fleet  when  Spruance  relieved  Halsey , on a series of raids on the Japanese and thence to support the assault on and occupation of Iwo Jima. On the morning of 16 February, the carrier began launching strikes on the  Tokyo  area of  Honsh . On 17 February, she repeated those strikes before heading toward the Bonins. Her aviators bombed and strafed installations on Chichi Jima on 18 February. The landings on Iwo Jima went forward on 19 February, and  Yorktown  aircraft began support missions over the island on 20 February. Those missions continued until 23 February at which time  Yorktown  cleared the Bonins to resume strikes on Japan proper. She arrived at the launch point on 25 February and sent two raids aloft to bomb and strafe airfields in the vicinity of Tokyo. On 26 February,  Yorktown  aircrewmen conducted a single sweep of installations on  Kysh  before TG 58.4 began its retirement to Ulithi. Yorktown re-entered the anchorage at Ulithi on 1 March.   She remained in the anchorage for about two weeks. On 14 March, the carrier departed the lagoon on her way to resume raids on Japan and to begin preliminary support work for the Okinawa operations scheduled for 1 April. On 18 March, she arrived in the operating area off Japan and began launching strikes on airfields on Kysh, Honsh, and  Shikoku .   The task group came under air attack almost as soon as operations began. At about 08:00, a twin-engine  bomber , probably a  Yokosuka P1Y  ""Frances"", attacked from her port side. The ship opened fire almost immediately and began scoring hits quickly. The plane began to burn but continued his run passing over  Yorktown' s bow and splashing in the water on her starboard side. Just seven minutes later, another Frances tried but also went down, a victim of the combined fire of the formation. No further attacks developed until that afternoon; and, in the meantime,  Yorktown  continued air operations. That afternoon, three  Yokosuka D4Y  ""Judy""  dive-bombers  launched attacks on the carrier. The first two failed in their attacks and were shot in their attempts. The third succeeded in planting his bomb on the signal bridge. It passed through the first deck and exploded near the ship's hull. It punched two large holes through her side, killed five men, and wounded another 26.  Yorktown , however, remained fully operational, and her anti-aircraft gunners brought the attacker down. She continued air operations against the three southernmost islands of Japan and retired for fueling operations on 20 March.   On 21 March, she headed for Okinawa, on which she began softening-up strikes on 23 March. Those attacks continued until 28 March when she started back to Japanese waters for an additional strike on the home islands. On 29 March, the carrier put two raids and one photographic reconnaissance mission into the air over Kysh. That afternoon, at about 14:10, a single ""Judy"" made an apparent suicide dive on  Yorktown . The anti-aircraft guns scored numerous hits. The plane passed over the ship and crashed about 60 feet (18 m) from (20 m) portside.   On 30 March,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of her task group began to concentrate solely on the island of Okinawa and its surrounding islets. For two days, they pounded the island in softening-up strikes. On 1 April, the assault troops stormed ashore; and, for almost six weeks, she sent her planes to the island to provide direct support for the troops operating ashore. About every three days, she retired to the east to conduct fueling rendezvous or to rearm and re-provision. The only exception to that routine came on 7 April when it was discovered that a Japanese task force built around the elusive  battleship   Yamato  was steaming south for one last, desperate, offensive.  Yorktown  and the other carriers quickly launched strikes to attack that valued target.  Air Group 9  aviators claimed several torpedo hits on  Yamato  just before the battleship exploded and sank. At least three 500 pound bomb hits on  light cruiser   Yahagi  sunk it also. The pilots also made strafing runs on the escorting destroyers and claimed to have left one afire in a sinking condition. At the conclusion of that action,  Yorktown  and her planes resumed their support for the troops on Okinawa. On 11 April, she came under air attack again when a single-engine plane sped in on her.  Yorktown' s anti-aircraft gunners brought down the plane. Sporadic air attacks continued until her 11 May departure from the  Rykys , but  Yorktown  sustained no additional damage and claimed only one further kill with her anti-aircraft battery. On 11 May, TG 58.4 was detached to proceed to Ulithi for upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   Yorktown  entered the lagoon at Ulithi on 14 May and remained there until 24 May at which time she sortied with TG 58.4 to rejoin the forces off Okinawa. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 when Halsey relieved Spruance and 5th Fleet again became 3rd Fleet. That same day, the carrier resumed air support missions over Okinawa. That routine lasted until the beginning of June when she moved off with TF 38 to resume strikes on the Japanese homeland. On 3 June, her aircraft made four different sweeps of airfields. The following day, she returned to Okinawa for a day of additional support missions before steaming off to evade a typhoon. On 6 June and 7 June, she resumed Okinawa strikes. She sent her aviators back to the Kysh airfields and, on 9 June, launched them on the first of two days of raids on  Minami Daito Shima . After the second day's strikes,  Yorktown  began retirement with TG 38.4 toward Leyte. She arrived in  San Pedro Bay  at Leyte on 13 June and began replenishment, upkeep, rest, and relaxation.   The warship remained at Leyte until 1 July when she and TG 38.4 got underway to join the rest of the fast carriers in the final series of raids on the Japanese home islands. By 10 July, she was off the coast of Japan launching air strikes on the Tokyo area of Honsh. After a fueling rendezvous on 11 June and 12 June, she resumed strikes on Japan, this on the southern portion of the northernmost island  Hokkaid . Those strikes lasted from 13 June to 15 June. A fueling retirement and heavy weather precluded air operations until 18 June, at which time her aviators returned to the Tokyo area. From 19 June to 22 June, she made a fueling and underway replenishment retirement and then, on 24 June, resumed air attacks on Japan. For two days, planes of her air group pounded installations around the  Kure  naval base. Another fueling retirement came on 26 June, and on 27 June and 28 June, her planes were in the air above Kure again. On 29 June and 30 June, she shifted targets back to the Tokyo area before another fueling retirement and another typhoon took her out of action until the beginning of the first week in August. On 8 August and 9 August, the carrier launched her planes at northern Honsh and southern Hokkaido. On 10 August, she sent them back to Tokyo. On 11 August and 12 August, another fueling retirement and a typhoon evasion was scheduled. On 13 August, her aircraft hit Tokyo for the last time. On 14 August, she retired to fuel destroyers again; and, on 15 August, Japan agreed to capitulate so that all strikes planned for that day were canceled.   From 16 August to 23 August,  Yorktown  and the other carriers of TF 58 steamed around the waters to the east of Japan awaiting instructions while peace negotiations continued. She then received orders to head for waters east of Honsh where her aircraft were to provide cover for the forces occupying Japan. She began providing that air cover on 25 August and continued to do so until mid-September. After the formal surrender on board battleship  Missouri  on 2 September, the aircraft carrier also began air-dropping supplies to Allied  prisoners of war  still living in their prison camps. On 16 September,  Yorktown  entered  Tokyo Bay  with TG 38.1. She remained there, engaged in upkeep and crew recreation through the end of the month. On 1 October, the carrier stood out of Tokyo Bay on her way to Okinawa. She arrived in  Buckner Bay  on 4 October, loaded passengers, and got underway for the United States on 6 October.     [ edit ]   1945  1952          Mothballed  Yorktown  at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in 1948       After a non-stop voyage,  Yorktown  entered  San Francisco Bay  on 20 October, moored at the Alameda Naval Air Station, and began discharging passengers. She remained at the air station until 31 October at which time she shifted to  Hunters Point Navy Yard  to complete minor repairs. On 2 November, while still at the navy yard, she reported to the Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty in conjunction with the return of American servicemen to the United States. That same day, she stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Guam on just such a mission. She arrived in  Apra Harbor  on 15 November and, two days later, got underway with a load of passengers. She arrived back in San Francisco on 30 November. On 8 December, the warship headed back to the Far East. Initially routed to  Samar  in the Philippines, she was diverted to  Manila  en route. She arrived in Manila on 26 December and departed there on 29 December. She reached San Francisco again on 13 January 1946. Later that month, she moved north to  Bremerton, Washington , where she was placed in commission, in reserve, on 21 June. She remained there in that status through the end of the year. On 9 January 1947,  Yorktown  was placed out of commission and was berthed with the Bremerton Group,  Pacific Reserve Fleet .     [ edit ]   1953  1955           Yorktown  after the SCB-27A conversion in 1953       Yorktown  remained in reserve for almost five years. In June 1952, she was ordered reactivated, and work began on her at  Puget Sound . On 15 December 1952, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at Bremerton. Her conversion continued into 1953 and she conducted post-conversion trials late in January. On 20 February 1953,  Yorktown  was placed in full commission as an attack carrier (CVA), with Captain  William M. Nation  in command. The aircraft carrier conducted normal operations along the west coast through most of the summer of 1953. On 3 August, she departed San Francisco on her way to the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor and remained there until 27 August, at which time she continued her voyage west. On 5 September, the carrier arrived in  Yokosuka , Japan. She put to sea again on 11 August to join TF 77 in the  Sea of Japan . The  Korean War  armistice had been signed two months earlier; and, therefore, the carrier conducted training operations rather than combat missions. She served with TF 77 until 18 February 1954, at which time she stood out of Yokosuka on her way home. She made a stop at Pearl Harbor along the way and then moored at Alameda once more on 3 March. After a brief repair period at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard,  Yorktown  put to sea to serve as a platform for the filming of the  Academy Award  nominated short subject documentary film  Jet Carrier . She conducted further, more routine, operations along the west coast until 1 July, at which time she headed back to the Orient. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 8 July to 28 July before continuing on to Manila, where she arrived on 4 August.   Yorktown  operated out of the Manila- Subic Bay  area, conducting  7th Fleet  maneuvers, for the duration of the deployment. She did, however, take periodic breaks from that schedule to make frequent port visits to Yokosuka; and, during the  Christmas  holidays, she made a liberty call at Hong Kong on the Chinese coast. In January 1955, she was called upon to help cover the evacuation of  Nationalist Chinese  from the  Tachen Islands  located near the communist-controlled mainland.  Yorktown  entered Yokosuka for the last time on 16 February 1955 but departed again on 18 February to return home. After an overnight stop at Pearl Harbor on 23 February and 24 February, she resumed her voyage east and arrived in Alameda on 28 February. On 21 March 1955, she was placed in commission, in reserve, at the  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard  where she was to receive extensive modificationsmost significantly, an angled  flight deck  to increase her jet aircraft launching capability. She completed her conversion that fall and, on 14 October, was placed back in full commission.     [ edit ]   1955  1957   The carrier resumed normal operations along the west coast soon after recommissioning. That assignment lasted until mid-March 1956. On 19 March, she stood out of San Francisco Bay on her way to her third tour of duty with the 7th Fleet since her reactivation in 1953.  Yorktown  stopped at Pearl Harbor from 24 March to 9 April and then continued her voyage west. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 18 April and departed again on 29 April. The warship operated with the 7th Fleet for the next five months. During that time, she conducted operations in the Sea of Japan, the  East China Sea , and the South China Sea. She also visited such places as  Sasebo , Manila, Subic Bay, and Buckner Bay at Okinawa. On 7 September, the aircraft carrier stood out of Yokosuka and pointed her bow to the east. After a non-stop voyage, she arrived back at Alameda on 13 September. She resumed west coast operations for about two months. On 13 November, she embarked upon a round-trip to Pearl Harbor, from which she returned to Alameda on 11 December.  Yorktown  resumed normal operations out of Alameda upon her return and remained so employed until March 1957. On 9 March, she departed Alameda for yet another tour of duty in the Far East. She made stops at Oahu and Guam along the way and arrived at Yokosuka on 19 April. She put to sea to join TF 77 on 25 April and served with that task force for the next three months. On 13 August, the warship departed Yokosuka for the last time, made a brief pause at Pearl Harbor, and arrived in Alameda on 25 August.     [ edit ]   1957  1960   On 1 September 1957, her home port was changed from Alameda to  Long Beach, California , and she was reclassified an  antisubmarine warfare  (ASW) aircraft carrier with the new designation  CVS-10 . On 23 September, she departed Alameda and, four days later, entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for overhaul and for modification to an ASW carrier. That yard period lasted until the beginning of February 1958. She departed the naval ammunition depot at  Bangor, Washington , on 7 February and entered Long Beach five days later. For the next eight months,  Yorktown  conducted normal operations along the west coast. On 1 November, she departed San Diego to return to the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor from 8 November to 17 November,  Yorktown  continued her voyage west and arrived in Yokosuka on 25 November. During that deployment, the aircraft carrier qualified for the  Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal  on three occasions. The first time came on 31 December and 1 January 1959, when she participated in an American show of strength in response to the communist Chinese shelling of the offshore islands,  Quemoy  and  Matsu , held by Nationalist Chinese forces. During January, she also joined contingency forces off  Vietnam  during internal disorders caused by communist guerrillas in the southern portion of that country. That month she earned the expeditionary medal for service in the  Taiwan Strait . The remainder of the deploymentsave for another visit to Vietnamese waters late in Marchconsisted of a normal round of training evolutions and port visits. She concluded that tour of duty at  San Diego  on 21 May. The warship resumed normal operations along the west coast, and that duty consumed the remainder of 1959.   In January 1960,  Yorktown  headed back to the Far East via Pearl Harbor. During that deployment, she earned additional stars for her Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for duty in Vietnamese waters at various times in March, April, May, and June. She returned to the west coast late in the summer and, late in September, began a four-month overhaul at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.     [ edit ]   1961  1964   Yorktown  emerged from the shipyard in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That tour of duty in the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and into the fall. On 26 October, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for the Far East. During that deployment, she served as  flagship  for  Carrier Division 19 . She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the  SEATO  ASW exercise,  Operation Sea Serpent . The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.   Yorktown  arrived back in her home port on 18 June and resumed normal operations for the remainder of the year. Those operations continued throughout most of 1964 as well. However, on 22 October, she pointed her bow westward again and set out for a tour of duty with the 7th Fleet. Another period of operations in the Hawaiian Islands delayed her arrival in Japan until 3 December.     [ edit ]   1965  1968   The 1964 and 1965, deployment brought  Yorktown  her first real involvement in the  Vietnamese civil war . In February, March, and April, she conducted a series of special operations in the South China Sea in waters near Vietnampresumably ASW services for the fast carriers conducting air strikes against targets in Vietnam in support of the increased American involvement in the civil war in that country. She concluded her tour of duty in the Far East on 7 May 1965, when she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. The carrier arrived in Long Beach on 17 May.   For the remainder of her active career,  Yorktown' s involvement in combat operations in Vietnam proved a dominant feature of her activities. After seven months of normal operations out of Long Beach, she got underway for the western Pacific again on 5 January 1966. She arrived in Yokosuka on 17 February and joined TF 77 on  Yankee Station  later that month. Over the next five months, the aircraft carrier spent three extended tours of duty on Yankee Station providing ASW and sea-air rescue services for the carriers of TF 77. She also participated in several ASW exercises, including the major SEATO exercise,  Operation Sea Imp . The warship concluded her last tour of duty on Yankee Station early in July and, after a stop at Yokosuka, headed home on 15 July. She disembarked her air group at San Diego on 27 July and reentered Long Beach that same day. She resumed normal operationscarrier qualifications and ASW exercisesfor the remainder of the year and during the first two months of 1967.   On 24 February 1967,  Yorktown  entered the  Long Beach Naval Shipyard  for a seven-month overhaul. She completed repairs early in October and, after refresher training, resumed normal west coast operations for most of what remained of 1967. On 28 December, she stood out of Long Beach, bound for her last tour of duty in the western Pacific. After a stop at Pearl Harbor, she arrived in the Far East late in January 1968. Instead of putting in at a Japanese port for turnover  Yorktown  headed directly to the Sea of Japan to provide ASW and search and rescue (SAR) support for the contingency force assembled in the wake of the  North Korean  capture of  Pueblo . She remained on that assignment for 30 days. On 1 March, she was released from that duty, and the warship headed for Subic Bay in the Philippines. During the remainder of the deployment, the aircraft carrier did another three tours of duty with TF 77 on Yankee Station. In each instance, she provided ASW and SAR support for the fast carriers launching air strikes on targets in Vietnam. She concluded her last tour of duty in Vietnamese waters on 16 June and set a course for Sasebo Japan where she stopped from 19 June to 21 June before heading back to the United States.     [ edit ]   1968  1975          The  Apollo 8  Command Module on the deck of the USS  Yorktown       Yorktown  arrived back in Long Beach on 5 July and entered the Long Beach Naval Shipyard that same day for almost three months of repairs. She completed repairs on 30 September and resumed normal operations. Late in November and early in December, she served as a platform for the filming of another movie,  Tora! Tora! Tora!  which recreated the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor . In December 1968, she served as one of the  recovery ships  for the  Apollo 8  space deployment. The two missions mentioned above were conducted out of Pearl Harbor. She departed Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1969, and after a two-week stop in Long Beach, continued her voyage to join the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet . Steaming around South America, the aircraft carrier arrived in her new home port Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February. She conducted operations along the east coast and in the  West Indies  until late summer. On 2 September,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk for a northern European cruise and participation in the major fleet exercise  Operation Peacekeeper . During the exercise, she provided ASW and SAR support for the task force. The exercise ended on 23 September, and  Yorktown  began a series of visits to northern European ports. After a visit each to  Brest, France , and  Rotterdam  in the  Netherlands ,  Yorktown  put to sea for a series of hunter/killer ASW exercises between 18 October and 11 November. She resumed her itinerary of port visits on 11 November at  Kiel ,  Germany . After that, she stopped at  Copenhagen ,  Denmark , and at  Portsmouth ,  England , before getting underway for home on 1 December. She reentered Norfolk on 11 December and began her holiday leave period.   During the first half of 1970,  Yorktown  operated out of Norfolk and began preparations for inactivation. On 27 June 1970,  Yorktown  was decommissioned at  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , and was berthed with the Philadelphia Group,  Atlantic Reserve Fleet . She remained there almost three years before her name was struck from the  Navy List  on 1 June 1973. During 1974, the  Navy Department  approved the donation of  Yorktown  to the  Patriot's Point Development Authority ,  Charleston, South Carolina . She was towed from  Bayonne, New Jersey , to Charleston in June 1975. She was formally dedicated as a memorial on the 200th anniversary of the Navy, 13 October 1975.

clueweb09-enwp01-18-19441	"                     Military history of South Africa during World War II          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                  Contents       1   World War II     1.1   Political choices at outbreak of war   1.2   Declaration of war against the Axis   1.3   Field Marshal and Prime Minister Smuts   1.4   Manpower   1.5   Military contributions and casualties in World War II                   [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   Political choices at outbreak of war   On the eve of  World War II  the Union of  South Africa  found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with  Great Britain , being a co-equal Dominion under the 1931 Statute of Westminster with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on September 1, 1939 was none other than  Barry Herzog  - the leader of the pro-Afrikaner and anti-British National party that had joined in a unity government as the  United Party .   Herzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against  Nazi  Germany. The Polish-British Common Defence Pact obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler's forces attacked Poland on the night of August 31, 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the Parliament of South Africa. It pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side - led by the pro-Allied/pro-British  African   General  (later  Field Marshal ) and former Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  - against Herzog, who wished to keep South Africa ""neutral"", if not actually pro-Axis.     [ edit ]   Declaration of war against the Axis   On September 4, 1939, the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II and deposed him in favor of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa, he declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the Cape of Good Hope.   John Vorster  and other members of  Ossewabrandwag  strongly objected to South Africa's participation in World War II and actively carried out sabotage against Jan Smuts' government. Smuts took severe action against the pro-Nazi South African Ossewabrandwag movement and jailed its leaders - including Vorster - for the duration of the war.     [ edit ]   Field Marshal and Prime Minister Smuts   Field Marshal Jan Smuts was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister  Winston Churchill . Smuts was invited to the Imperial War Cabinet in 1939 as the most senior South African in favour of war. On 28 May 1941, Smuts was appointed a Field Marshal of the British Army, becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular amongst the Afrikaners, leading to his eventual downfall.     [ edit ]   Manpower   With the declaration of war in September 1939, the South African Army numbered only 3,353 regulars, with an additional 14,631 men of the Active Citizen Force (ACF) which gave peace time training to volunteers and in time of war would form the main body of the army. Pre-war plans did not anticipate that the army would fight outside southern Africa and it was trained and equipped only for bush warfare.   One of the problems to continuously face South Africa during the war was the shortage of available men. Due to its race policies it would only consider arming men of European descent which limited the available pool of men aged between 20 and 40 to around 320,000. In addition the declaration of war on Germany had the support of only a narrow majority in the South African parliament and was far from universally popular. Indeed, there was a significant minority actively opposed to the war and under these conditions conscription was never an option. The expansion of the army and its deployment overseas depended entirely on volunteers.   Given the countrys attitudes to race, it is not surprising that the enlistment of fighting troops from the much larger black population was hardly considered. Instead, in an attempt to free up as many whites as possible for the fighting and technical arms, a number of corps were formed to provided drivers and pioneers, drawn from the more acceptable Cape Coloured and Indian populations. These were eventually amalgamated into the  Cape Corps . A Native Military Corps, manned by blacks, was also formed for pioneer and labouring tasks. For some of their tasks, individuals were armed, mainly for self-protection and guard duties, but they were never allowed to participate in actual combat against Europeans.     [ edit ]   Military contributions and casualties in World War II   South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theaters of war. South Africa's contribution consisted mainly of supplying troops, men and material for the North African campaign (the Desert War) and the Italian Campaign as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean that converge at the tip of Southern Africa. Numerous volunteers also flew for the  Royal Air Force .     The South African Army and Air Force helped defeat the Italian army of the Fascist Benito Mussolini that had invaded Abyssinia (now known as Ethiopia) in 1935. During the 1941  East African Campaign  South African forces made important contribution to this early Allied victory.   Another important victory that the South African's participated in was the liberation of Malagasy (now known as Madagascar) from the control of the Vichy French who were allies of the Nazis. British troops aided by South African soldiers, staged their attack from South Africa, occupied the strategic island in 1942 to preclude its seizure by the Japanese.   The  South African 1st Infantry Division  took part in several actions in  North Africa  in 1941 and 1942, including the Battle of  El Alamein , before being withdrawn to South Africa.   The  South African 2nd Infantry Division  also took part in a number of actions in North Africa during 1942, but on 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of Tobruk.   The  South African 3rd Infantry Division  never took an active part in any battles but instead organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and supplied replacements for the South African 1st Infantry Division and the South African 2nd Infantry Division. However, one of this division's constituent brigades - 7 SA Motorised Brigade - did take part in the invasion of Madagascar in 1942.   The  South African 6th Armoured Division  fought in numerous actions in Italy from 1944 to 1945.     Of the 334,000 men volunteered for full time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 ""coloureds"" and Asians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action.                 v      d      e     History of World War II by region or sovereign state                     Albania     Australia     Austria  (Anschluss)     Azerbaijan     Belarus

The Union of South Africa was tied closely to the  British Empire , and automatically joined with Great Britain and the allies against the  German Empire . Both Prime Minister  Louis Botha  and Defence Minister  Jan Smuts , both former  Second Boer War  generals who had fought against the British then, but who now became active and respected members of the  Imperial War Cabinet . (See  Jan Smuts during World War I .)   South Africa was part of significant military operations against Germany. In spite of Boer resistance at home, the Afrikaner-led government of  Louis Botha  unhestitatingly joined the side of the  Allies of World War I  and fought alongside its armies. The South African Government agreed to the withdrawal of British Army units so that they were free to join the European war, and laid plans to invade  German South-West Africa . Elements of the South African army refused to fight against the Germans and along with other opponents of the Government rose in open revolt. The government declared martial law on  14 October  1914, and forces loyal to the government under the command of General Louis Botha and Jan Smuts proceeded to destroy the  Maritz Rebellion . The leading Boer rebels got off lightly with terms of imprisonment of six and seven years and heavy fines. (See  World War I and the Maritz Rebellion .)     [ edit ]   Military action against Germany during World War I   The South African  Union Defence Force  saw action in a number of areas:     It dispatched its army to  German South-West Africa  (later known as  South West Africa  and now known as  Namibia ). The South Africans expelled German forces and gained control of the former German colony. (See  South-West Africa Campaign .)   A military expedition under General  Jan Smuts  was dispatched to  German East Africa  (later known as  Tanganyika  and now known as  Tanzania ). The objective was to fight German forces in that colony and to try to capture the elusive German General  von Lettow-Vorbeck . Ultimately, Lettow-Vorbeck fought his tiny force out of German East Africa into  Mozambique  then  Northern Rhodesia , where he accepted a cease-fire three days after the end of the war. (See  East African Campaign (World War I) .)   1st South African Brigade  troops were shipped to  France  to fight on the  Western Front . The most costly battle that the South African forces on the Western Front fought in was the  Battle of Delville Wood  in  1916 . (See  South African Army in World War I .)   South Africans also saw action with the  Cape Corps  as part of the  Egyptian Expeditionary Force  in  Palestine . (See  Cape Corps 1915 - 1991 )       [ edit ]   Military contributions and casualties in World War I   More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 blacks and 2,500 people of mixed race ("" Coloureds "") and  Asians  served in  South African military units during the war , including 43,000 in German South-West Africa and 30,000 on the Western Front. An estimated 3,000 South Africans also joined the  Royal Flying Corps . The total South African casualties during the war was about 18,600 with over 12,452 killed - more than 4,600 in the European theater alone.          The  British Empire  is red on the map, at its zenith in  1919 . ( India  highlighted in purple.)  South Africa , bottom center, lies between both halves of the Empire.       There is no question that South Africa greatly assisted the Allies, and Great Britain in particular, in capturing the two German colonies of German West Africa and German East Africa (although many South African troops were tied down by the failure to capture all the German East Africa forces) as well as in battles in Western Europe and the Middle East. South Africa's ports and harbors, such as at  Cape Town ,  Durban , and  Simon's Town , were also important rest-stops, refueling-stations, and served as strategic assets to the British  Royal Navy  during the war, helping to keep the vital  sea lanes  to the  British Raj  open.     [ edit ]   World War II     [ edit ]   Political choices at outbreak of war   On the eve of World War II the Union of South Africa found itself in a unique political and military quandary. While it was closely allied with Great Britain, being a co-equal  Dominion  under the  1931 Statute of Westminster  with its head of state being the British king, the South African Prime Minister on September 1, 1939 was none other than  Barry Hertzog  the leader of the pro-Afrikaner anti-British  National party  that had joined in a unity government as the  United Party .   Herzog's problem was that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against  Nazi Germany . The  Polish-British Common Defence Pact  obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if attacked by the Nazis. After Hitler's forces attacked Poland on the night of August 31, 1939, Britain declared war on Germany within a few days. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially in the halls of power in the  Parliament of South Africa , that pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by the pro- Allied , pro-British Afrikaner, ex-General, and former Prime Minister  Jan Smuts   against  then-current Prime Minister Barry Hertzog who wished to keep South Africa ""neutral"", if not pro- Axis .     [ edit ]   Declaration of war against the Axis   On September 4,  1939 , the United Party caucus refused to accept Hertzog's stance of neutrality in  World War II  and deposed him in favor of Smuts. Upon becoming Prime Minister of South Africa, Smuts declared South Africa officially at war with Germany and the Axis. Smuts immediately set about fortifying South Africa against any possible German sea invasion because of South Africa's global strategic importance controlling the long sea route around the  Cape of Good Hope .   Smuts took severe action against the pro-Nazi South African  Ossewabrandwag  movement (they were caught committing acts of sabotage) and jailed its leaders for the duration of the war. (One of them,  John Vorster , was to become future Prime Minister of South Africa.) (See  Jan Smuts during World War II .)     [ edit ]   Prime Minister and Field Marshal Smuts       Main article:  Jan Smuts       Prime Minister  Jan Smuts  was the only important non-British general whose advice was constantly sought by Britain's war-time Prime Minister  Winston Churchill . Smuts was invited to the  Imperial War Cabinet  in  1939  as the most senior South African in favour of war. In  28 May   1941 , Smuts was appointed a  Field Marshal  of the  British Army , becoming the first South African to hold that rank. Ultimately, Smuts would pay a steep political price for his closeness to the British establishment, to the King, and to Churchill which had made Smuts very unpopular among the conservative nationalistic  Afrikaners , leading to his eventual downfall, whereas most  English-speaking whites  and a minority of liberal Afrikaners in South Africa remained loyal to him. (See  Jan Smuts during World War II .)     [ edit ]   Military contributions and casualties in World War II   South Africa and its military forces contributed in many theaters of war.  South Africa's contribution  consisted mainly of supplying troops, men and material for the  North African campaign  (the Desert War) and the  Italian Campaign  as well as to Allied ships that docked at its crucial ports adjoining the  Atlantic Ocean  and  Indian Ocean  that converge at the tip of  Southern Africa . Numerous volunteers also flew for the  Royal Air Force . (See:  South African Army in World War II ;  South African Air Force in World War II ;  South African Navy in World War II ;  South Africa's contribution in World War II .)     The South African Army and  Air Force  helped defeat the Italian army of the Fascist  Benito Mussolini  that had  invaded Abyssinia  (now known as  Ethiopia ) in 1935. During the 1941  East African Campaign  South African forces made important contribution to this early Allied victory.   Another important victory that the South African's participated in was the liberation of  Malagasy  (now known as  Madagascar ) from the control of the  Vichy French  who were allies of the Nazis.

However, one of this division's constituent brigades -  7 SA Motorised Brigade  - did take part in the invasion of  Madagascar  in 1942.   The  South African 6th Armoured Division  fought in numerous actions in  Italy  from  1944  to  1945 .   South Africa contributed to the war effort against Japan, supplying men and manning ships in naval engagements against the Japanese.  [ 1 ]     Of the  334,000 men volunteered for full time service in the South African Army during the war  (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 ""coloureds"" and Asians), nearly 9,000 were killed in action.     [ edit ]   Aftermath of World War II   South Africa emerged from the Allied victory with its prestige and national honor enhanced as it had fought tirelessly for the Western Allies. South Africa's standing in the international community was rising, at a time when the Third World's struggle against colonialism had still not taken center stage. In May  1945 , Prime Minister Smuts represented South Africa in  San Francisco  at the drafting of the  United Nations Charter . Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international body to preserve peace; he was determined that, unlike the  League of Nations , the  United Nations  would have teeth. Smuts signed the  Paris Peace Treaty , resolving the peace in Europe, thus becoming the only signatory of both the treaty ending the First World War, and that ending the Second.   However, internal political struggles in the disgruntled and essentially impoverished Afrikaner community would soon come to the fore leading to Smuts' defeat at the polls in the  1948 elections  (in which only whites and coloureds could vote) at the hands of a resurgent National Party after the war. This began the road to South Africa's eventual isolation from a world that would no longer tolerate any forms of political discrimination or differentiation based on race only.

The  American Civil War  (18611865) was a  civil war  between the  United States of America  (the "" Union "") and the  Southern   slave states  of the newly-formed  Confederate States of America  under  Jefferson Davis . The Union included all of the  free states  and the five slaveholding  border states  and was led by  Abraham Lincoln  and the  Republican Party . Republicans opposed the expansion of  slavery  into territories owned by the United States, and their victory in the  presidential election of 1860  resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office. [ 1 ]  The Union rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .

clueweb09-enwp01-96-13425	"                     Turning point of the American Civil War          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          There is widespread disagreement over the  turning point of the American Civil War . The idea of a turning point is an event after which most observers would agree that the eventual outcome was inevitable. While the  Battle of Gettysburg  (often cited in combination with  Battle of Vicksburg ) is the most widely cited, there are several arguable turning points in the  American Civil War . Some possibilities are presented here in chronological order. Only the positive arguments for each are given.   At the time of the event, the  fog of war  often makes it impossible to recognize all of the implications of any one victory. Hindsight well after the fact reveals the endpoint and all the developments that led up to it. In most cases, contemporary observers may lack confidence in predicting a turning point. In the Civil War, many of the turning points cited by historians would not have been recognized as such at the time.

Until this time, the North was generally confident about its prospects for quickly crushing the rebellion with an easy, direct strike against the Confederate capital,  Richmond, Virginia . The embarrassing rout of Maj. Gen.  Irvin McDowell 's army disabused them of this notion. The North was shocked and realized that this was going to be a lengthier, bloodier war than they had anticipated. It steeled their determination. Lincoln almost immediately signed legislation that increased the army by 500,000 men and allowed for their term of service to be for the duration of the war. Congress quickly passed the  Confiscation Act of 1861 , which provided for freeing slaves whose masters participated in the rebellion, which was the first attempt to define the war legislatively as a matter of ending  slavery . If the Confederacy had hoped before this that they could sap Northern determination and quietly slip away from the Union with a minor military investment, their victory at Bull Run destroyed those hopes. (The Confederacy did enjoy a small advantage when Lincoln used Bull Run as a reason to appoint the inept Maj. Gen.  George B. McClellan  as head of all the Union armies, but this advantage was fleeting.)     [ edit ]   Confederate invasion of Kentucky (September 1861)   By mid-1861, twelve states seceded, but four more slave-owning states remained in the Union Missouri ,  Kentucky ,  Maryland , and  Delaware . Kentucky was considered the most at risk; the state  legislature  had declared neutrality in the dispute, which was a moderately pro-Confederate stance. The loss of Kentucky would have been catastrophic because of its control of the  Tennessee  and  Ohio Rivers  and its position from which the vital state of  Ohio  could be invaded. Lincoln wrote, ""I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.""   On  September 3 ,  1861 , Confederate General  Leonidas Polk  extended his defensive line north from  Tennessee  when  Gideon Pillow  occupied  Columbus, Kentucky  (in response to Ulysses S. Grant's occupation of  Belmont, Missouri , directly across the Mississippi River). Polk followed that by moving through the  Cumberland Gap  and occupying parts of southeastern Kentucky. This violation of state neutrality enraged many of its citizens; the state legislature, overriding the veto of the governor, requested assistance from the federal government. Kentucky was never again a safe area of operation for Confederate forces. Ironically, Polk's actions were not directed by the Confederate government. Thus, almost by accident, the Confederacy was placed at an enormous strategic disadvantage. Indeed, the early Union successes in the war's  western theater  (their only non-naval successes until 1863) are directly related to Polk's blunder.     [ edit ]   Union capture of Forts Henry and Donelson (February 1862)   The capture of Forts  Henry  and  Donelson , and the Confederate surrender at the latter, were the first significant Union victories and the start of a mostly successful campaign in the western theater. Ulysses S. Grant completed both actions by  February 16 ,  1862 , and by doing so, opened the Tennessee and  Cumberland Rivers  as Union supply lines and avenues of invasion to Tennessee,  Mississippi , and eventually  Georgia . The loss of control of these rivers was a significant strategic defeat for the Confederacy. This was the start of offensive actions by Grant that, with the sole exception of the  Battle of Shiloh , would continue for the rest of the war.     [ edit ]   Union victory in Battle of Antietam (September 1862)   The  Battle of Antietam ,  September 17 ,  1862 , was the bloodiest day in American history. But it also had two strategic consequences. Although considered a tactical draw between the Army of the Potomac and the much smaller Army of Northern Virginia, it marked the end of Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. One of his goals was to entice the slave-holding state of Maryland to join the Confederacy, or at least recruit soldiers there. He failed in that objective. He also failed in marshaling Northern fears and opinions to pressure a settlement to the war.   But more strategically, George B. McClellan's victory was just convincing enough that Lincoln used it as justification for announcing his  Emancipation Proclamation ; he had been counseled by his Cabinet to keep this action confidential until a Union battlefield victory could be announced. Otherwise, it might seem merely an act of desperation. Along with its immense effect on American history and race relations, the Emancipation Proclamation effectively prevented the  British Empire  from recognizing the Confederacy as a legitimate government. The British public had strong anti-slavery beliefs and would not have tolerated joining the pro-slavery side of a fight where slavery was now a prominent issue. This removed one of the Confederacy's only hopes of surviving a lengthy war against the North's suffocating naval blockade. Support from  France  was still a possibility, but it never came to pass. Antietam and two other coincident failed actions Braxton Bragg 's invasion of Kentucky and  Earl Van Dorn 's advance against  Corinth, Mississippi represented the Confederacy's only attempt at coordinated strategic offensives in multiple theaters of war.     [ edit ]   Union capture of Vicksburg and victory in Battle of Gettysburg (July 1863)   On  July 4 ,  1863 , the  Confederate  stronghold on the  Mississippi River ,  Vicksburg, Mississippi ,  surrendered  to General  Ulysses S. Grant . The previous day, Maj. Gen.  George Meade  had decisively defeated  Robert E. Lee  at  Gettysburg . These twin events are the most often cited as  the  turning points of the war.   The loss of Vicksburg split the Confederacy, denying its control of the Mississippi River and preventing supplies from  Texas  and  Arkansas  that could sustain the war effort from passing east. As  President   Abraham Lincoln  had stated, ""See what a lot of land these fellows hold, of which Vicksburg is the key! The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.... We can take all the northern ports of the Confederacy, and they can defy us from Vicksburg."" And the 30,000 soldiers who surrendered with the city were a significant loss to the cause.   Gettysburg was the first major defeat suffered by Lee. It repelled his second invasion of the North and inflicted serious casualties on the  Army of Northern Virginia . In fact, the  National Park Service  marks the point at which  Pickett's Charge  collapsedthe Copse of Trees on Cemetery Ridgeas the  high-water mark of the Confederacy . From this point onward, Lee attempted no more strategic offensives. Although two more years of fighting and a new, aggressive general (Grant) were required, the  Army of the Potomac  had the initiative and the eventual end at  Appomattox Court House  seems inevitable in hindsight.   Gettysburg was seen by military and civilian observers as a great battle, but those in the North had little idea that two more bloody years would be required to finish the war. Southern morale was not strongly affected by the defeat because many assumed that Lee had suffered only a temporary setback and would resume his winning ways against ineffective  Union  generals.   Some economic historians have pointed to the fact that after the loss at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, the market for Confederate  war bonds  dropped precipitously. ""European investors gave  Johnny Reb  about a 42 percent chance of winning the war in early 1863 prior to the battle of Gettysburg. ... However, news of the severity of costly Confederate defeats at Gettysburg/Vicksburg led to a sell-off in rebel bonds and the probability of a Southern victory fell to about 15 percent by the end of 1863."" [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Union victory in Third Battle of Chattanooga (November 1863)   Military historian  J.F.C. Fuller  contended that Grant's defeat of Braxton Bragg's army at  Chattanooga  was the turning point of the war because it reduced the Confederacy to the Atlantic Coast and opened the way for Sherman's  Atlanta Campaign  and  March to the Sea . [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Grant's appointment as Union general-in-chief (March 1864)   Following the victory at Chattanooga, Grant was appointed general-in-chief of all Union armies on  March 12 , 1864. Leaving  Sherman  in command of forces in the  western theater , he moved his headquarters east to  Virginia . Previous Union commanders in the critical  eastern theater  had not mounted effective campaigns, or pursued Confederate forces after gaining rare victories. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the Confederacy from multiple directions: against Lee near Richmond; in the  Shenandoah Valley ; against  Johnston  and  Atlanta ; against railroad supply lines in  West Virginia ; and against the port of  Mobile . In May, Grant launched the  Overland Campaign , putting the Confederates under an unremitting pressure that was maintained until the fall of their capital,  Richmond , and the surrender of Lee's  Army of Northern Virginia .     [ edit ]   Union capture of Atlanta (September 1864)   Some contend that the successful  siege of Atlanta  by the Union was the turning point, since the city was the most critical point in the South. This victory lifted the spirits of the North and helped re-elect Lincoln, in addition to its military result of crippling  transportation  in the heart of the Confederacy, and nearly destroying the city.     [ edit ]   Lincoln's reelection (November 1864)   The re-election of  Abraham Lincoln  in 1864 is beyond the final point at which a positive conclusion for the Confederacy could have been contemplated. His opponent, former general  George B. McClellan , ran on a  Democratic Party  platform that favored a peaceful settlement with the Confederacy. Although McClellan disavowed this platform, the South would have likely seen his election as a strategic victory.

Confederate  General  Robert E. Lee  drove the invading  Union   Army of the Potomac , commanded by  Maj. Gen.   George B. McClellan , away from Richmond and into a retreat down the  Virginia Peninsula . The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the  Seven Days Campaign , but it was actually the culmination of the  Peninsula Campaign , not a separate campaign in its own right.   The Seven Days began on June 25, 1862, with a Union attack in the minor  Battle of Oak Grove , but McClellan quickly lost the initiative as Lee began a series of attacks at  Beaver Dam Creek  (Mechanicsville) on June 26,  Gaines' Mill  on June 27, the minor actions at  Garnett's and Golding's Farm  on June 27 and June 28, and the attack on the Union rear guard at  Savage's Station  on June 29. McClellan's  Army of the Potomac  continued its retreat toward the safety of  Harrison's Landing  on the  James River . Lee's final opportunity to intercept the Union Army was at the  Battle of Glendale  on June 30, but poorly executed orders allowed his enemy to escape to a strong defensive position on Malvern Hill. At the  Battle of Malvern Hill  on July 1, Lee launched futile frontal assaults and suffered heavy casualties in the face of strong infantry and artillery defenses.   The Seven Days ended with McClellan's army in relative safety next to the James River, having suffered almost 16,000 casualties during the retreat. Lee's army, which had been on the offensive during the Seven Days, lost over 20,000. As Lee became convinced that McClellan would not resume his threat against Richmond, he moved north for the  Northern Virginia Campaign  and the  Maryland Campaign .

The Peninsula Campaign was the unsuccessful attempt by McClellan to capture the  Confederate  capital of Richmond and end the war. It started in March 1862, when McClellan landed his army at  Fort Monroe  and moved northwest, up the  Virginia Peninsula  beginning in early April. Confederate  Brig. Gen.   John B. Magruder 's defensive position on the  Warwick Line  caught McClellan by surprise. His hopes for a quick advance foiled, McClellan ordered his army to prepare for a  siege of Yorktown . Just before the siege preparations were completed, the Confederates, now under the direct command of Johnston, began a withdrawal toward Richmond. The first heavy fighting of the campaign occurred in the  Battle of Williamsburg  (May 5), in which the Union troops managed some tactical victories, but the Confederates continued their withdrawal. An amphibious flanking movement to  Eltham's Landing  (May 7) was ineffective in cutting off the Confederate retreat. In the  Battle of Drewry's Bluff  (May 15), an attempt by the  U.S. Navy  to reach Richmond by way of the James River was repulsed.   As McClellan's army reached the outskirts of Richmond, a minor battle occurred at  Hanover Court House  (May 27), but it was followed by a surprise attack by Johnston at the  Battle of Seven Pines  or Fair Oaks on May 31 and June 1. The battle was inconclusive, with heavy casualties, but it had lasting effects on the campaign. Johnston was wounded and replaced on June 1 by the more aggressive Robert E. Lee. Lee spent almost a month extending his defensive lines and organizing his  Army of Northern Virginia ; McClellan accommodated this by sitting passively to his front until the start of the Seven Days. Lee, who had developed a reputation for caution early in the war, knew he had no numerical superiority over McClellan, but he planned an offensive campaign that marked the aggressive nature by which he was characterized for the remainder of the war.     [ edit ]   Opposing forces     Further information:  Seven Days Confederate order of battle ,  Seven Days Union order of battle     The armies that fought in the Seven Days Battles comprised almost 200,000 men, which offered the potential for the largest battles of the war. However, the inexperience or caution of the generals involved usually prevented the appropriate concentration of forces and mass necessary for decisive tactical victories.

James Longstreet                         Maj. Gen.   John B. Magruder                     Maj. Gen.   Benjamin Huger                     Maj. Gen.   Theophilus H. Holmes                   Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was larger than the one he inherited from Johnston, and, at about 92,000 men, the largest Confederate army assembled during the war.     Maj. Gen.   Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson , having just arrived from his victories in the  Valley Campaign , commanded a force consisting of his own  division  (now commanded by Brig. Gen.  Charles S. Winder ) and those of Maj. Gen.  Richard S. Ewell ,  Brig. Gen.   William H. C. Whiting , and Maj. Gen.  D.H. Hill .   Maj. Gen.  A.P. Hill 's ""Light Division"" (which was so named because it traveled light and was able to maneuver and strike quickly) consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens.  Charles W. Field ,  Maxcy Gregg ,  Joseph R. Anderson ,  Lawrence O'Bryan Branch ,  James J. Archer , and  William Dorsey Pender .   Maj. Gen.  James Longstreet 's division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens.  James L. Kemper ,  Richard H. Anderson ,  George E. Pickett ,  Cadmus M. Wilcox ,  Roger A. Pryor , and  Winfield Scott Featherston . Longstreet also had operational command over Hill's Light Division.   Maj. Gen.  John B. Magruder  commanded the divisions of Maj. Gen.  Lafayette McLaws , Brig. Gen.  David R. Jones , and Magruder's own division, commanded by Brig. Gen.  Howell Cobb .   Maj. Gen.  Benjamin Huger 's division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens.  William Mahone ,  Ambrose R. Wright ,  Lewis A. Armistead , and  Robert Ransom, Jr.   Maj. Gen.  Theophilus H. Holmes 's division consisted of the brigades of Brig. Gens.  Junius Daniel ,  John G. Walker ,  Henry A. Wise , and the cavalry brigade of Brig. Gen.  J.E.B. Stuart .       [ edit ]   Planning for offensives   Lee's initial attack plan, similar to Johnston's plan at Seven Pines, was complex and required expert coordination and execution by all of his subordinates, but Lee knew that he could not win in a battle of attrition or siege against the Union Army. It was developed at a meeting on June 23. The Union Army straddled the rain-swollen  Chickahominy River , with the bulk of the army, four corps, arrayed in a semicircular line south of the river. The remainder, the V Corps under Brig. Gen.  Fitz John Porter , was north of the river near  Mechanicsville  in an L-shaped line facing north-south behind Beaver Dam Creek and southeast along the Chickahominy. Lee's plan was to cross the Chickahominy with the bulk of his army to attack the Union north flank, leaving only two divisions (under Maj. Gens.  Benjamin Huger  and  John B. Magruder ) to hold a line of entrenchments against McClellan's superior strength. This would concentrate about 65,500 troops to oppose 30,000, leaving only 25,000 to protect Richmond and to contain the other 60,000 men of the Union Army. The Confederate cavalry under Brig. Gen.  J.E.B. Stuart  had reconnoitered Porter's right flank (as part of a daring, although militarily pointless, circumnavigation of the entire Union Army from June 12 to June 15) and found it vulnerable. [ 5 ]   Lee intended for Jackson to attack Porter's right flank early on the morning of June 26, and A.P. Hill would move from Meadow Bridge to Beaver Dam Creek, which flows into the Chickahominy, advancing on the Federal trenches. (Lee hoped that Porter would evacuate his trenches under pressure, obviating the need for a direct frontal assault.) Following this, Longstreet and D.H. Hill would pass through Mechanicsville and join the battle. Huger and Magruder would provide diversions on their fronts to distract McClellan as to Lee's real intentions. Lee hoped that Porter would be overwhelmed from two sides by the mass of 65,000 men, and the two leading Confederate divisions would move on Cold Harbor and cut McClellan's communications with White House Landing.   McClellan also planned an offensive. He had received intelligence that Lee was prepared to move and that the arrival of Maj. Gen.  Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson's  force from the  Shenandoah Valley  was imminent. (McClellan was aware of Jackson's presence at Ashland Station, but did nothing to reinforce Porter's vulnerable corps north of the river.) [ 6 ]  He decided to resume the offensive before Lee could. Anticipating Jackson's reinforcements marching from the north, he increased cavalry patrols on likely avenues of approach. He wanted to advance his siege artillery about a mile and a half closer to the city by taking the high ground on Nine Mile Road around Old Tavern. In preparation for that, he planned an attack on Oak Grove, south of Old Tavern and the  Richmond and York River Railroad , which would position his men to attack Old Tavern from two directions. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   The Seven Days          Seven Days Battles, June 2627, 1862.         [ edit ]   Oak Grove     Further information:  Battle of Oak Grove     McClellan planned to advance to the west, along the axis of the Williamsburg Road, in the direction of Richmond. Between the two armies was a small, dense forest, 1,200 yards wide, bisected by the headwaters of White Oak Swamp. Two divisions of the III Corps were selected for the assault, commanded by Brig. Gens.  Joseph Hooker  and  Philip Kearny . Facing them was the division of Confederate Maj. Gen.  Benjamin Huger . [ 8 ]   At 8:30 a.m., June 25, the Union  brigades  of Brig. Gens.  Daniel E. Sickles  (the  Excelsior Brigade ),  Cuvier Grover , both of Hooker's division, and  John C. Robinson  stepped off. Although Robinson and Grover made good progress on the left and in the center, Sickles's New Yorkers encountered difficulties moving through their  abatis , then through the upper portions of the swamp, and finally met stiff Confederate resistance, all of which threw the Federal line out of alignment. Huger took advantage of the confusion by launching a counterattack with the brigade of Brig. Gen.  Ambrose R. Wright  against Grover's brigade. At a crucial moment in the battle, the 25th North Carolina of Brig. Gen.  Robert Ransom 's brigade, in their first combat engagement, delivered a perfectly synchronized volley of rifle fire against Sickles's brigade, breaking up its delayed attack and sending the 71st New York into a panicked retreat, which Sickles described as ""disgraceful confusion."" [ 9 ]   Heintzelman ordered reinforcements sent forward and also notified army commander McClellan, who was attempting to manage the battle by  telegraph  from 3 miles away. McClellan ordered his men to withdraw back to their entrenchments, mystifying his subordinates on the scene. Arriving at the front at 1 p.m., seeing that the situation was not as bad as he had feared, McClellan ordered his men forward to retake the ground for which they had already fought once that day. The fighting lasted until nightfall. [ 10 ]   The minor battle was McClellan's only tactical offensive action against Richmond. His attack gained only 600 yards at a cost of over 1,000 casualties on both sides and was not strong enough to derail the offensive planned by Robert E. Lee, which already had been set in motion. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville)     Further information:  Battle of Beaver Dam Creek     Lee's plan called for Jackson to begin the attack on Porter's north flank early on June 26. A.P. Hill's Light Division was to advance from Meadow Bridge when he heard Jackson's guns, clear the Union pickets from Mechanicsville, and then move to Beaver Dam Creek. D.H. Hill and Longstreet were to pass through Mechanicsville and support Jackson and A.P. Hill. South of the river, Magruder and Huger were to demonstrate to deceive the four Union corps on their front. [ 12 ]   Lee's intricate plan went awry immediately. Jackson's men, fatigued from their recent campaign and lengthy march, ran at least four hours behind schedule. By 3 p.m., A.P. Hill grew impatient and began his attack without orders, a frontal assault with 11,000 men. Porter extended and strengthened his right flank and fell back to concentrate along Beaver Dam Creek and Ellerson's Mill. There, 14,000 well entrenched soldiers, aided by 32 guns in six batteries, repulsed repeated Confederate attacks with substantial casualties. [ 13 ]   Jackson and his command arrived late in the afternoon and he ordered his troops to bivouac for the evening while a major battle was raging within earshot. His proximity to Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, 5 miles to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the  Richmond and York River Railroad  north of the Chickahominy, and he decided to shift his base of supply to the  James River . He also believed that the diversions by Huger and Magruder south of the river meant that he was seriously outnumbered. This was a strategic decision of grave import because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he would be forced to abandon his siege of Richmond. A.P. Hill, now with Longstreet and D.H. Hill behind him, continued his attack, despite orders from Lee to hold his ground. His assault was beaten back with heavy casualties. [ 14 ]   Overall, the battle was a Union tactical victory, in which the Confederates suffered heavy casualties and achieved none of their specific objectives due to the seriously flawed execution of Lee's plan. Instead of over 60,000 men crushing the enemy's flank, only five brigades, about 15,000 men, had seen action. Their losses were 1,484 versus Porter's 361. Despite the short-term Union success, however, it was the start of a strategic debacle. McClellan began to withdraw his army to the southeast and never regained the initiative. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Gaines' Mill     Further information:  Battle of Gaines' Mill     By the morning of June 27, the Union forces were concentrated into a semicircle with Porter collapsing his line into an east-west salient north of the river and the four corps south of the river remaining in their original positions. McClellan ordered Porter to hold Gaines' Mill at all costs so that the army could change its base of supply to the James River. Several of McClellan's subordinates urged him to attack the Magruder's division south of the river, but he feared the vast numbers of Confederates he believed to be before him and refused to capitalize on the overwhelming superiority he actually held on that front. [ 16 ]   Lee continued his offensive on June 27, launching the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions. [ 17 ]  A.P. Hill resumed his attack across Beaver Dam Creek early in the morning, but found the line lightly defended. By early afternoon, he ran into strong opposition by Porter, deployed along Boatswain's Creek and the swampy terrain was a major obstacle against the attack. As Longstreet arrived to the south of A.P. Hill, he saw the difficulty of attacking over such terrain and delayed until Stonewall Jackson could attack on Hill's left. [ 18 ]   For the second time in the Seven Days, however, Jackson was late. D.H. Hill attacked the Federal right and was held off by the division of Brig. Gen.  George Sykes ; he backed off to await Jackson's arrival. Longstreet was ordered to conduct a diversionary attack to stabilize the lines until Jackson could arrive and attack from the north. In Longstreet's attack, Brig. Gen.  George E. Pickett 's brigade attempted a frontal assault and was beaten back under severe fire with heavy losses. Jackson finally reached D.H. Hill's position at 3 p.m. and began his assault at 4:30 p.m. [ 19 ]   Porter's line was saved by Brig. Gen.  Henry W. Slocum 's division moving into position to bolster his defense. Shortly after dark, the Confederates mounted another attack, poorly coordinated, but this time collapsing the Federal line. Brig. Gen.  John Bell Hood 's  Texas Brigade  opened a gap in the line, as did Pickett's Brigade on its second attempt of the day. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter withdrew across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him. [ 20 ]   For the second day, Magruder was able to continue fooling McClellan south of the river by employing minor diversionary attacks. He was able to occupy 60,000 Federal troops while the heavier action occurred north of the river. [ 21 ]   Gaines' Mill was the only clear-cut Confederate tactical victory of the Peninsula Campaign. [ 22 ]  Union casualties from the 34,214 engaged were 6,837 (894 killed, 3,107 wounded, and 2,836 captured or missing). Of the 57,018 Confederates engaged, losses totaled 7,993 (1,483 killed, 6,402 wounded, 108 missing or captured). [ 23 ]  Since the Confederate assault was conducted against only a small portion of the Union Army (the V Corps, one fifth of the army), the army emerged from the battle in relatively good shape overall. However, although McClellan had already planned to shift his supply base to the James River, his defeat unnerved him and he precipitously decided to abandon his advance on Richmond. [ 24 ]     [ edit ]   Union withdrawal   The night of June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to withdraw to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. He was actually in a strong position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks, while having deployed only one of his five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new  Army of Virginia  and ordered it to be sent to the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: ""If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or any other persons in Washingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army."" (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.)   McClellan ordered Keyes's IV Corps to move west of Glendale and protect the army's withdrawal, and Porter was to move to the high ground at Malvern Hill to develop defensive positions. The supply trains were ordered to move south toward the river. McClellan departed for Harrison's Landing without specifying any exact routes of withdrawal and without designating a second-in-command. For the remainder of the Seven Days, he had no direct command of the battles. Gaines' Mill and the Union retreat across the Chickahominy was a psychological victory for the Confederacy, signaling that Richmond was out of danger.   Lee's cavalry reported that Union troops had abandoned their defense of the  Richmond and York River Railroad  and the White House supply depot on the York River. That information, plus the sighting of large dust clouds south of the Chickahominy River, convinced Lee that McClellan was heading for the James. [ 25 ]     [ edit ]   Garnett's & Golding's Farm     Further information:  Battle of Garnett's & Golding's Farm     While Lee's main attack at Gaines' Mill was progressing on June 27, the Confederates south of the Chickahominy performed a  reconnaissance in force  to determine the location of McClellan's retreating army. Magruder ordered Brig. Gen.  Robert A. Toombs 's brigade forward to ""feel the enemy."" Toombs, a Georgia politician with a disdain for professional officers, instead launched a sharp attack at dusk against Baldy Smith's VI Corps division near Old Tavern at the farm of James M. Garnett. The attack was easily repulsed by the brigade of Brig. Gen.  Winfield S. Hancock . [ 26 ]   On June 28, Toombs again was ordered to conduct a reconnaissance, but turned it into an attack over the same ground, meeting the enemy at the farm of Simon Gouldin (also known as Golding). Toombs took it upon himself to order his fellow brigade commander, Brig. Gen.  George T. Anderson , to join the assault. Two of Anderson's regiments, the 7th and 8th Georgia, preceded Toombs's brigade into the assault and were subjected to a vigorous Federal counterattack by the 49th Pennsylvania and 43rd New York, losing 156 men. [ 27 ]   These were the only attacks south of the Chickahominy River in conjunction with Gaines' Mill, but they helped to convince McClellan that he was being subjected to attacks from all directions, increasing his anxiety and his determination to get his army to safety at the James. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Savage's Station     Further information:  Battle of Savage's Station     On June 29, the bulk of McClellan's army concentrated around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, preparing for a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines' Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command. Clouds of black smoke filled the air as the Union troops were ordered to burn anything they could not carry. Union morale plummeted, particularly so for those wounded, who realized that they were not being evacuated from Savage's Station with the rest of the Army. [ 29 ]   Lee devised a complex plan to pursue and destroy McClellan's army. Longstreet's and A.P. Hill's divisions looped back toward Richmond and then southeast to the crossroads at Glendale, Holmes's division headed farther south, to the vicinity of Malvern Hill, and Magruder's division was ordered to move due east to attack the Federal rear guard. Stonewall Jackson, commanding three divisions, was to rebuild a bridge over the Chickahominy and head due south to Savage's Station, where he would link up with Magruder and deliver a strong blow that might cause the Union Army to turn around and fight during its retreat. [ 30 ]  McClellan's rear guard at Savage's Station consisted five divisions from Sumner's II Corps, Heintzelman's III Corps, and Franklin's VI Corps. McClellan considered his senior corps commander, Sumner, to be incompetent, so he appointed no one to command the rear guard. [ 31 ]   Initial contact between the armies occurred at 9 a.m. on June 29, a four-regiment fight about 2 miles west of Savage's Station, lasting for about two hours before disengaging. [ 32 ]  Meanwhile, Jackson was not advancing as Lee had planned. He was taking time to rebuild bridges over the Chickahominy and he received a garbled order from Lee's chief of staff that made him believe he should stay north of the river and guard the crossings. These failures of the Confederate plan were being matched on the Union side, however. Heintzelman decided on his own that his corps was not needed to defend Savage's Station, so he decided to follow the rest of the army without informing his fellow generals. [ 33 ]   Magruder was faced with the problem of attacking Sumner's 26,600 men with his own 14,000. He hesitated until 5 p.m., when he sent only two and a half brigades forward. Union artillery opened fire and pickets were sent forward to meet the assault. [ 34 ]  The two brigade front of Kershaw and Semmes began to push the narrow defensive line of one of Sedgwick's brigades. Sumner managed this part of the battle erratically, selecting regiments for combat from multiple brigades almost at random. By the time all of these units reached the front, the two sides were at rough paritytwo brigades each. Although Magruder had been conservative about his attack, Sumner was even more so. Of the 26 regiments he had in his corps, only 10 were engaged at Savage's Station. [ 35 ]   The fighting turned into a bloody stalemate as darkness fell and strong thunderstorms began to move in. The ""Land  Merrimack ""the first instance of an armored railroad battery to be used in combatbombarded the Union front, with some of its shells reaching as far to the rear as the field hospital. The final action of the evening was as the  Vermont Brigade , attempting to hold the flank south of the Williamsburg Road, charged into the woods and were met with murderous fire, suffering more casualties of any brigade on the field that day. [ 36 ]   There were about 1,500 casualties on both sides, plus 2,500 previously wounded Union soldiers who were left to be captured when their field hospital was evacuated. Stonewall Jackson eventually crossed the river by about 2:30 a.m. on June 30, but it was too late to crush the Union Army, as Lee had hoped. General Lee reprimanded Magruder, but the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee's own headquarters and a less than aggressive performance by Jackson. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Glendale (Frayser's Farm) and White Oak Swamp     Further information:  Battle of Glendale  and  Battle of White Oak Swamp            Seven Days Battles, June 30, 1862.              Seven Days Battles, July 1, 1862.       Most elements of the Union Army had been able to cross White Oak Swamp Creek by noon on June 30. About one third of the army had reached the James River, but the remainder was still marching between White Oak Swamp and Glendale. After inspecting the line of march that morning, McClellan rode south and boarded the ironclad  USS  Galena  on the James. [ 38 ]   Lee ordered his army to converge on the retreating Union forces, bottlenecked on the inadequate road network. The Army of the Potomac, lacking overall command coherence, presented a discontinuous, ragged defensive line. Stonewall Jackson was ordered to press the Union rear guard at the White Oak Swamp crossing while the largest part of Lee's army, some 45,000 men, would attack the Army of the Potomac in mid-retreat at Glendale, about 2 miles southwest, splitting it in two. Huger's division would strike first after a three-mile march on the Charles City Road, supported by Longstreet and A.P. Hill, whose divisions were about 7 miles to the west, in a mass attack. Holmes was ordered to capture Malvern Hill. [ 39 ]   The Confederate plan was once again marred by poor execution. Huger's men were slowed by felled trees obstructing the Charles City Road, spending hours chopping a new road through the thick woods. Huger failed to take any alternative route, and, fearing a counterattack, failed to participate in the battle. Magruder marched around aimlessly, unable to decide whether he should be aiding Longstreet or Holmes; by 4 p.m., Lee ordered Magruder to join Holmes on the River Road and attack Malvern Hill. Stonewall Jackson moved slowly and spent the entire day north of the creek, making only feeble efforts to cross and attack Franklin's VI Corps in the  Battle of White Oak Swamp , attempting to rebuild a destroyed bridge, although adequate fords were nearby, and engaging in a pointless artillery duel. Jackson's inaction allowed some units to be detached from Franklin's corps in late afternoon to reinforce the Union troops at Glendale. Holmes's relatively inexperienced troops made no progress against Porter at Turkey Bridge on Malvern Hill, even with the reinforcements from Magruder, and were repulsed by effective artillery fire and by Federal gunboats on the James. [ 40 ]   At 2 p.m., as they waited for sounds of Huger's expected attack, Lee, Longstreet, and visiting Confederate President Jefferson Davis were conferring on horseback when they came under heavy artillery fire, wounding two men and killing three horses. A.P. Hill, the commander in that sector, ordered the president and senior generals to the rear. Longstreet attempted to silence the six batteries of Federal guns firing in his direction, but long-range artillery fire proved to be inadequate. He ordered Col.  Micah Jenkins  to charge the batteries, which brought on a general fight around 4 p.m. [ 41 ]   Although belated and not initiated as planned, the assaults by the divisions of A.P. Hill and Longstreet, under Longstreet's overall command, turned out to be the only ones to follow Lee's order to attack the main Union concentration. Longstreet's 20,000 men were not reinforced by other Confederate divisions of Huger and Jackson, despite their concentration within a three-mile radius. They assaulted the disjointed Union line of 40,000 men, arranged in a two-mile arc north and south of the Glendale intersection, but the brunt of the fighting was centered on the position held by the  Pennsylvania Reserves  division of the V Corps, 6,000 men under Brig. Gen.  George A. McCall , just west of the Nelson Farm. (The farm was owned by R.H. Nelson, but its former owner was named Frayser and many of the locals referred to it as Frayser's, or Frazier's, Farm.) [ 42 ]   Three Confederate brigades made the assault, but Longstreet ordered them forward in a piecemeal fashion, over several hours. Brig. Gen.  James L. Kemper 's Virginians charged through the thick woods first and emerged in front of five batteries of McCall's artillery. In their first combat experience, the brigade conducted a disorderly but enthusiastic assault, which carried them through the guns and broke through McCall's main line with Jenkins's support, followed up a few hours later by Brig. Gen.  Cadmus M. Wilcox 's  Alabamans . The Confederate brigades met stiff resistance in sometimes hand-to-hand combat. [ 43 ]   On McCall's flanks, the divisions of Brig. Gen.  Joseph Hooker  (to the south) and Brig. Gens.  Philip Kearny  and  Henry W. Slocum  (to the north), held against repeated Confederate attacks. Brig. Gen.  John Sedgwick 's division, which had units both in reserve and around White Oak Swamp, came up to fill a gap after a brutal counterattack. Heavy fighting continued until about 8:30 p.m. Longstreet committed virtually every brigade in the divisions under his command, while on the Union side they had been fed in individually to plug holes in the line as they occurred. [ 44 ]   The battle was tactically inconclusive, although Lee failed to achieve his objective of preventing the Federal escape and crippling McClellan's army, if not destroying it. Union casualties were 3,797, Confederate about the same at 3,673, but more than 40% higher in killed and wounded. Although Jackson's wing of the army and Franklin's corps comprised tens of thousands of men, the action at White Oak Swamp included no infantry activity and was limited to primarily an artillery duel with few casualties. [ 45 ]     [ edit ]   Malvern Hill     Further information:  Battle of Malvern Hill     The final battle of the Seven Days was the first in which the Union Army occupied favorable ground.  Malvern Hill  offered good observation and artillery positions, having been prepared the previous day by Porter's V Corps. McClellan himself was not present on the battlefield, having preceded his army to Harrison's Landing on the James, and Porter was the most senior of the corps commanders. The slopes were cleared of timber, providing great visibility, and the open fields to the north could be swept by deadly fire from the 250 guns placed by Col.  Henry J. Hunt , McClellan's chief of artillery. Beyond this space, the terrain was swampy and thickly wooded. Almost the entire Army of the Potomac occupied the hill and the line extended in a vast semicircle from Harrison's Landing on the extreme right to Brig. Gen.  George W. Morell 's division of Porter's corps on the extreme left, which occupied the geographically advantageous ground on the northwestern slopes of the hill.   Rather than flanking the position, Lee attacked it directly, hoping that his artillery would clear the way for a successful infantry assault. His plan was to attack the hill from the north on the Quaker Road, using the divisions of Stonewall Jackson,  Richard S. Ewell , D.H. Hill, and Brig. Gen.  William H.C. Whiting . Magruder was ordered to follow Jackson and deploy to his right when he reached the battlefield. Huger's division was to follow as well, but Lee reserved the right to position him based on developments. The divisions of Longstreet and A.P. Hill, which had been the most heavily engaged in Glendale the previous day, were held in reserve.   Once again, Lee's complex plan was poorly executed. The approaching soldiers were delayed by severely muddy roads and poor maps. Jackson arrived at the swampy creek called Western Run and stopped abruptly. Magruder's guides mistakenly sent him on the Long Bridge Road to the southwest, away from the battlefield. Eventually the battle line was assembled with Huger's division (brigades of Brig. Gens.  Ambrose R. Wright  and  Lewis A. Armistead ) on the Confederate right and D.H. Hill's division (brigades of Brig. Gen.  John Bell Hood  and Col.  Evander M. Law ) on the Quaker Road to the left. They awaited the Confederate bombardment before attacking.   Unfortunately for Lee, Henry Hunt struck first, launching one of the greatest artillery barrages in the war from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. The Union gunners had superior equipment and expertise and disabled most of the Confederate batteries. Despite the setback, Lee sent his infantry forward at 3:30 p.m. and Armistead's brigade made some progress through lines of Union sharpshooters. By 4 p.m., Magruder arrived and he was ordered forward to support Armistead. His attack was piecemeal and poorly organized. Meanwhile, D. H. Hill launched his division forward along the Quaker Road, past Willis Church. Across the entire line of battle, the Confederate troops reached only within 200 yards of the Union Center and were repulsed by nightfall with heavy losses.       It wasn't war; it was murder.   Major General  D.H. Hill       Lee's army suffered 5,355 casualties (versus 3,214 Union) in this wasted effort, but continued to follow the Union army all the way to Harrison's Landing. On Evelington Heights, part of the property of  Edmund Ruffin , the Confederates had an opportunity to dominate the Union camps, making their position on the bank of the James potentially untenable; although the Confederate position would be subjected to Union naval gunfire, the heights were an exceptionally strong defensive position that would have been very difficult for the Union to capture with infantry. Cavalry commander Jeb Stuart reached the heights and began bombardment with a single cannon. This alerted the Federals to the potential danger and they captured the heights before any Confederate infantry could reach the scene. [ 46 ]     [ edit ]   Aftermath   The Seven Days Battles ended the Peninsula Campaign. The Army of the Potomac encamped around Berkeley Plantation, birthplace of  William Henry Harrison . With its back to the James River, the army was protected by Union gunboats, but suffered heavily from heat, humidity, and disease. In August, they were withdrawn by order of President Lincoln to reinforce the Army of Virginia in the  Northern Virginia Campaign  and the  Second Battle of Bull Run .   Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia suffered about 20,000 casualties (3,494 killed, 15,758 wounded, and 952 captured or missing) out of a total of over 90,000 soldiers during the Seven Days. McClellan reported casualties of about 16,000 (1,734 killed, 8,062 wounded, and 6,053 captured or missing) out of a total of 105,445. Despite their victory, many Confederates were stunned by the losses.   The effects of the Seven Days Battles were widespread. After a successful start on the Peninsula that foretold an early end to the war, Northern morale was crushed by McClellan's retreat. Despite heavy casualties and clumsy tactical performances by Lee and his generals, Confederate morale skyrocketed, and Lee was emboldened to continue his aggressive strategy through Second Bull Run and the  Maryland Campaign . McClellan's previous position as general-in-chief of all the Union armies, vacant since March, was filled on July 11, 1862, by Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck , although McClellan did retain command of the Army of the Potomac. Lee reacted to the performances of his subordinates by a reorganization of his army and by forcing the reassignment of Holmes and Magruder out of Virginia.

Ernest D. McWhorter  in command.   After fitting out, the aircraft carrier trained in  Hampton Roads, Virginia  and in the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes into January 1938, conducting carrier qualifications for her newly embarked air group.   Yorktown  sailed for the  Caribbean  on 8 January 1938 and arrived at  Culebra ,  Puerto Rico , on 13 January. Over the ensuing month, the carrier conducted her shakedown, touching at  Charlotte Amalie ,  St Thomas ,  U.S. Virgin Islands ;  Gonaves ,  Haiti ;  Guantanamo Bay ,  Cuba , and  Cristbal ,  Panama Canal Zone . Departing  Colon Bay , Cristobal, on 1 March,  Yorktown  sailed for Hampton Roads, arrived on 6 March, and shifted to the  Norfolk Navy Yard  the next day for post-shakedown availability.   After undergoing repairs through the early autumn of 1938,  Yorktown  shifted from the navy yard to NOB Norfolk on 17 October and soon headed for the  Southern Drill Grounds  for training.   Yorktown  operated off the eastern seaboard, ranging from  Chesapeake Bay  to Guantanamo Bay, into 1939. As flagship for  Carrier Division 2 , she participated in her first war game -  Fleet Problem XX  - along with her sister-ship  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in February 1939. The scenario for the exercise called for one fleet to control the sea lanes in the Caribbean against the incursion of a foreign European power while maintaining sufficient naval strength to protect vital American interests in the Pacific. The maneuvers were witnessed, in part, by President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt , embarked in the heavy cruiser  USS  Houston  (CA-30) .   The critique of the operation revealed that carrier operations - a part of the scenarios for the annual exercises since the entry of  USS  Langley  (CV-1)  into the war games in 1925 - had achieved a new peak of efficiency. Despite the inexperience of  Yorktown  and  Enterprise  - comparative newcomers to the Fleet - both carriers made significant contributions to the success of the problem. The planners had studied the employment of carriers and their embarked air groups in connection with convoy escort, antisubmarine defense, and various attack measures against surface ships and shore installations. In short, they worked to develop the tactics that would be used when war actually came.     [ edit ]   Pacific Fleet   Following Fleet Problem XX,  Yorktown  returned briefly to Hampton Roads before sailing for the  Pacific  on 20 April 1939. Transiting the  Panama Canal  a week later,  Yorktown  soon commenced a regular routine of operations with the  Pacific Fleet . Operating out of  San Diego, California  into 1940, the carrier participated in  Fleet Problem XXI  that April.  Yorktown  was one of six ships to receive the new  RCA   CXAM   RADAR  in 1940. [ 1 ]   Fleet Problem XXI - a two-part exercise - included some of the operations that would characterize future warfare in the Pacific. The first part of the exercise was devoted to training in making plans and estimates; in screening and scouting; in coordination of combatant units; and in employing fleet and standard dispositions. The second phase included training in  convoy  protection, the seizure of advanced bases, and, ultimately, the decisive engagement between the opposing fleets. The last pre-war exercise of its type, Fleet Problem XXI, contained two exercises (comparatively minor at the time) where air operations played a major role. Fleet Joint Air Exercise 114A prophetically pointed out the need to coordinate Army and Navy defense plans for the  Hawaiian Islands , and Fleet Exercise 114 proved that aircraft could be used for high altitude tracking of surface forces - a significant role for planes that would be fully realized in the war to come.   With the retention of the Fleet in Hawaiian waters after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XXI,  Yorktown  operated in the Pacific off the west coast of the United States and in Hawaiian waters until the following spring, when the success of German  U-boats  preying upon British shipping in the Atlantic required a shift of American naval strength. Thus, to reinforce the  U.S. Atlantic Fleet , the Navy transferred a substantial force from the Pacific including  Yorktown , Battleship Division Three (the  New Mexico class battleships ), three light cruisers, and 12 accompanying destroyers.     [ edit ]   Neutrality patrol   Yorktown  departed  Pearl Harbor  on 20 April 1941 in company with  USS  Warrington  (DD-383) ,  USS  Somers  (DD-381) , and  USS  Jouett  (DD-396) ; headed southeast, transited the Panama Canal on the night of 67 May, and arrived at  Bermuda  on 12 May. From that time until the United States entered the war,  Yorktown  conducted four patrols in the Atlantic, ranging from  Newfoundland  to Bermuda and logging 17,642 miles (28,392 km) steamed while enforcing American neutrality.   Although  Adolf Hitler  had forbidden his  submarines  to attack American ships, the men who manned the American naval vessels were not aware of this policy and operated on a wartime footing in the Atlantic.   On 28 October, while  Yorktown , battleship  USS  New Mexico  (BB-40) , and other American warships were screening a convoy, a destroyer picked up a submarine contact and dropped depth charges while the convoy itself made an emergency starboard turn, the first of the convoy's three emergency changes of course. Late that afternoon, engine repairs to one of the ships in the convoy,  Empire Pintail , reduced the convoy's speed to 11 knots (13 mph; 20 km/h).   During the night, the American ships intercepted strong German radio signals, indicating submarines probably in the vicinity reporting the group. Rear Admiral  H. Kent Hewitt , commanding the escort force, sent a destroyer to sweep astern of the convoy to destroy the U-boat or at least to drive him under.   The next day, while cruiser scout planes patrolled overhead,  Yorktown  and  USS  Savannah  (CL-42)  fueled their escorting destroyers, finishing the task as dusk fell. On 30 October,  Yorktown  was preparing to fuel three destroyers when other escorts made sound contacts. The convoy subsequently made 10 emergency turns while  USS  Morris  (DD-417)  and  USS  Anderson  (DD-411)  dropped depth charges, and  USS  Hughes  (DD-410)  assisted in developing the contact. Anderson later made two more depth charge attacks, noticing ""considerable oil with slick spreading but no wreckage.""   The short-of-war period was becoming more like the real thing as each day went on. Elsewhere on 30 October and more than a month before Japanese planes attacked Pearl Harbor,  U-562  torpedoed the destroyer  USS  Reuben James  (DD-245) , sinking her with a heavy loss of life - the first loss of an American warship in World War II.   After another Neutrality Patrol stint in November,  Yorktown  put into Norfolk on 2 December and was there five days later when American fighting men in Hawaii were rudely awakened to find their country at war.     [ edit ]   World War II     See also:  World War II             Yorktown  prepares to get underway in June, 1940.       The early news from the Pacific was bleak: the Pacific Fleet had taken a beating. With the battle line crippled, the undamaged American carriers assumed great importance. There were, on 7 December, only three in the Pacific:  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6) ,  USS  Lexington  (CV-2) , and  USS  Saratoga  (CV-3) .  USS  Ranger  (CV-4) ,  USS  Wasp  (CV-7) , and the recently commissioned  USS  Hornet  (CV-8)  remained in the Atlantic,  Yorktown  departed Norfolk on 16 December 1941 for the Pacific, her secondary gun galleries studded with new  Oerlikon 20 mm guns . She reached San Diego 30 December 1941 and soon became flagship for Rear Admiral  Frank Jack Fletcher 's newly formed  Task Force 17 .   The carrier's first mission in her new theater was to escort a convoy carrying Marine reinforcements to  American Samoa . Departing San Diego on 6 January 1942,  Yorktown  and her consorts covered the movement of marines to  Tutuila  and  Pago Pago  to augment the garrison already there.   Having safely covered that troop movement,  Yorktown , in company with sister ship  Enterprise , departed Samoan waters on 25 January. Six days later, TF8 (built around  Enterprise ), and TF17 (around  Yorktown ) parted company. The former headed for the  Marshall Islands , the latter for the  Gilberts , each to take part in some of the first American offensives of the war, the Marshalls-Gilberts raids.   At 05:17,  Yorktown  - screened by  USS  Louisville  (CA-28)  and  USS  St. Louis  (CL-49)  and four destroyers - launched 11 Douglas  TBD-1 Devastators  and 17 Douglas  SBD-3 Dauntlesses , under the command of Comdr.  Curtis W. Smiley . Those planes hit what Japanese shore installations and shipping they could find at  Jaluit , but severe thunderstorms hampered the mission, and seven planes were lost. Other  Yorktown  planes attacked Japanese installations and ships at  Makin  and  Mili  Atolls.   The attack on the Gilberts by TF17 had apparently been a complete surprise since the American force encountered no enemy surface ships. A single four-engined  Kawanishi H6K  ""Mavis"" patrol flying boat attempted to attack American destroyers sent astern in hope of recovering the crews of planes overdue from the Jaluit mission. Antiaircraft fire from the destroyers drove off the intruder before he could cause any damage.   Later, another ""Mavis""-or possibly the same one-came out of low clouds 15,000 yards (14,000 m) distant from  Yorktown . The carrier withheld her antiaircraft fire in order not to interfere with the  combat air patrol  (CAP) fighters. Presently, the ""Mavis"", pursued by two  F4F Wildcats , disappeared behind a cloud. Within five minutes, the enemy patrol plane fell out of the clouds and crashed in the water.   Although TF17 was slated to make a second attack on Jaluit, it was canceled because of heavy rainstorms and the approach of darkness. Therefore, the  Yorktown  force retired from the area.   Admiral  Chester Nimitz  later called the Marshalls-Gilberts raids ""well conceived, well planned, and brilliantly executed."" The results obtained by TFs 8 and 17 were noteworthy, Nimitz continued in his subsequent report, because the task forces had been obliged to make their attacks somewhat blindly, due to lack of hard intelligence data on the Japanese-mandated islands.   Yorktown  subsequently put in at Pearl Harbor for replenishment before she put to sea on 14 February, bound for the  Coral Sea . On 6 March, she rendezvoused with TF11 - formed around  Lexington  and under the command of Rear Admiral  Wilson Brown  - and headed towards  Rabaul  and  Gasmata  to attack Japanese shipping there in an effort to check the Japanese advance and to cover the landing of Allied troops at  Nouma ,  New Caledonia . However, as the two carriers - screened by a powerful force of eight heavy cruisers (including the Australian  HMAS  Australia  and 14 destroyers - steamed toward  New Guinea , the Japanese continued their advance toward Australia with a landing on 7 March at the  Huon Gulf , in the  Salamaua - Lae  area on the eastern end of New Guinea.   Word of the Japanese operation prompted Admiral Brown to change the objective of TF11's strike from Rabaul to the Salamaua-Lae sector. On the morning of 10 March 1942, American carriers launched aircraft from the  Gulf of Papua .  Lexington  flew off her air group commencing at 07:49 and, 21 minutes later,  Yorktown  followed suit. While the choice of the gulf as the launch point for the strike meant the planes would have to fly some 125 miles (201 km) across the  Owen Stanley mountains  - a range not known for the best flying conditions - that approach provided security for the task force and ensured surprise.   In the attacks that followed,  Lexington's  SBDs from Scouting Squadron 2 (VS-2) commenced dive-bombing Japanese ships at Lae at 0922. The carrier's torpedo and bomber squadrons (VT-2 and VB-2) attacked shipping at Salamaua at 09:38. Her fighters (VF-2) split up into four-plane attack groups: one strafed Lae and the other, Salamaua.  Yorktown's  planes followed on the heels of those from ""Lady Lex."" VB-5 and VT-5 attacked Japanese ships in the Salamaua area at 0950, while VS-5 went after auxiliaries moored close in shore at Lae. The fighters of VF-42 flew CAP over Salamaua until they determined there was no air opposition, then strafed surface objectives and small boats in the harbor.   After carrying out their missions, the American planes returned to their carriers, and 103 planes of the 104 launched were back safely on board by noon. One SBD-2 had been downed by Japanese antiaircraft fire. The raid on Salamaua and Lae was the first attack by many pilots of both carriers; and, while the resultant torpedo and bombing accuracy was inferior to that achieved in later actions, the operation gave the fliers invaluable experience which enabled them to do so well in the  Battle of the Coral Sea  and the Battle of Midway.          The  Yorktown  is refueled by the  USS  Brazos  (AO-4)  mid-Pacific in July 1940.       Task Force 11 retired at 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) on a southeasterly course until dark, when the ships steered eastward at 15 knots (17 mph; 28 km/h) and made rendezvous with  Task Group 11.7  (TG11.7), four  heavy cruisers  and four destroyers under the Australian Rear Admiral  John Crace , which provided cover for the carriers on their approach to New Guinea.   Yorktown  resumed her patrols in the Coral Sea area, remaining at sea into April, out of reach of Japanese land-based aircraft and ready to carry out offensive operations whenever the opportunity presented itself. After the Lae-Salamaua raid, the situation in the South Pacific seemed temporarily stabilized, and  Yorktown  and her consorts in TF17 put in to the undeveloped harbor at  Tongatapu , in the  Tonga  Islands, for needed upkeep, having been at sea continuously since departing from Pearl Harbor on 14 February.   However, the enemy was soon on the move. To Admiral Nimitz, there seemed to be ""excellent indications that the Japanese intended to make a seaborne attack on  Port Moresby  the first week in May.""  Yorktown  accordingly departed Tongatapu on 27 April 1942, bound once more for the Coral Sea. TF11 - now commanded by Rear Admiral  Aubrey W. Fitch , who had relieved Brown in  Lexington  - departed Pearl Harbor to join Fletcher's TF 17 and arrived in the vicinity of  Yorktown's  group, southwest of the  New Hebrides  Islands, on 1 May.     [ edit ]   Battle of the Coral Sea       Main article:  Battle of the Coral Sea       At 15:17 the next afternoon, two Dauntlesses from VS-5 sighted a Japanese submarine, running on the surface. Three Devastators took off from  Yorktown , sped to the scene, and carried out an attack that only succeeded in driving the submarine under.   On the morning of 3 May, TF11 and TF17 were some 100 miles (200 km) apart, engaged in fueling operations. Shortly before midnight, Fletcher received word from Australian-based aircraft that Japanese transports were disembarking troops and equipment at  Tulagi  in the  Solomon Islands . Arriving soon after the Australians had evacuated the place, the Japanese landed to commence construction of a seaplane base there to support their southward thrust.   Yorktown  accordingly set course northward at 27 knots (31 mph; 50 km/h). By daybreak on 4 May, she was within striking distance of the newly established Japanese beachhead and launched her first strike at 0701-18 F4F-3's of VF-42, 12 TBD's of VT-5, and 28 SBD's from VS and BY-5.  Yorktown's  air group made three consecutive attacks on enemy ships and shore installations at Tulagi and  Gavutu  on the south coast of  Florida Island  in the Solomons. Expending 22 torpedoes and 76 1,000 pound bombs in the three attacks,  Yorktown's  planes sank the destroyer  Kikuzuki , three minecraft and four barges. In addition, Air Group 5 destroyed five enemy seaplanes, all at the cost of two F4F's lost (the pilots were recovered) and one TBD (whose crew was lost).   Meanwhile, that same day, TF 44, a cruiser-destroyer force under Rear Admiral Crace (RN), joined  Lexington's  TF11, thus completing the composition of the Allied force on the eve of the crucial Battle of the Coral Sea.   Elsewhere, to the northward, eleven troop-laden transports - escorted by destroyers and covered by the light carrier  Shh , four heavy cruisers, and a destroyer - steamed toward Port Moresby. In addition, another Japanese task force - formed around the two Pearl Harbor veterans, carriers  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku , and screened by two heavy cruisers and six destroyers - provided additional air cover.   On the morning of 6 May, Fletcher gathered all Allied forces under his tactical command as TF17. At daybreak on the 7th, he dispatched Crace, with the cruisers and destroyers under his command, toward the  Louisiade  archipelago to intercept any enemy attempt to move toward Port Moresby.   While Fletcher moved north with his two flattops and their screens in search of the enemy, Japanese search planes located the oiler  USS  Neosho  (AO-23)  and her escort,  USS  Sims  (DD-409)  and misidentified the former as a carrier. Two waves of Japanese planes  first high level bombers and then dive bombers  attacked the two ships.  Sims , her antiaircraft battery crippled by gun failures, took three direct hits and sank quickly with a heavy loss of life.  Neosho  was more fortunate in that, even after seven direct hits and eight near-misses, she remained afloat until, on the 11th, her survivors were picked up by  USS  Henley  (DD-391)  and her hulk sunk by the rescuing destroyer.   Neosho  and  Sims  had performed a valuable service, drawing off the planes that might otherwise have hit Fletcher's carriers. Meanwhile,  Yorktown  and  Lexington's  planes found  Shh  and sunk her. One of  Lexington's  pilots reported this victory with the radio message, ""Scratch one flattop"".   That afternoon,  Shkaku  and  Zuikaku  - still not located by Fletcher's forces - launched 27 bombers and torpedo planes to search for the American ships. Their flight proved uneventful until they ran into fighters from  Yorktown  and  Lexington , who proceeded to down nine enemy planes in the ensuing dogfight.   Near twilight, three Japanese planes incredibly mistook  Yorktown  for their own carrier and attempted to land. The ship's gunfire, though, drove them off; and the enemy planes crossed  Yorktown' s bow and turned away out of range. Twenty minutes later, when three more enemy pilots made the mistake of trying to get into  Yorktown's  landing circle, the carrier's gunners splashed one of the trio.   However, the battle was far from over. The next morning, 8 May, a  Lexington  search plane spotted Admiral  Takeo Takagi 's carrier striking force - including  Zuikaku  and  Shkaku .  Yorktown  planes scored two bomb hits on  Shkaku , damaging her flight deck and preventing her from launching aircraft; in addition, the bombs set off explosions in gasoline storage tanks and destroyed an engine repair workshop.  Lexington' s Dauntlesses added another hit. Between the two American air groups, the hits killed 108 Japanese sailors and wounded 40 more.   While the American planes were occupying the Japanese flattops, however,  Yorktown  and  Lexington  - alerted by an intercepted message which indicated that the Japanese knew of their whereabouts - were preparing to fight off a retaliatory strike, which came shortly after 11:00.   American CAP Wildcats downed 17 planes, though some managed to slip through the defenses.  ""Kates""  launched torpedoes from both sides of  Lexington's  bows. Two ""fish"" tore into ""Lady Lex"" on the port side;  ""Val""   dive bombers  added to the destruction with three bomb hits.  Lexington  developed a list, with three partially-flooded engineering spaces. Several fires raged below decks, and the carrier's elevators were put out of commission.   Meanwhile  Yorktown  was having problems of her own. Maneuvered by Captain  Elliott Buckmaster , her commanding officer, the carrier dodged eight torpedoes. Attacked then by ""Vals"", the ship managed to evade all but one bomb. That one, however, penetrated the flight deck and exploded below decks, killing or seriously injuring 66 men.   Lexington's  damage control parties brought the fires under control, and the ship was still able to continue flight operations despite the damage. The air battle itself ended shortly before noon on the 8th; within an hour, the carrier was on an even keel, although slightly down by the bow. However, an explosion caused by the ignition of gasoline vapors later caused a fire and tore apart the inside.  Lexington  was abandoned at 1707, and later sunk by  USS Phelps .   The Japanese had won a tactical victory, inflicting comparatively heavier losses on the Allied force, but the Allies, in stemming the tide of Japan's conquests in the South and Southwest Pacific, had achieved a strategic victory.  Yorktown  had not achieved her part in the victory without cost, and had suffered enough damage to cause experts to estimate that at least three months in a yard would be required to put her back in fighting trim. However, there was little time for repairs, because Allied intelligence - most notably the cryptographic unit at Pearl Harbor - had gained enough information from decoded Japanese naval messages to estimate that the Japanese were on the threshold of a major operation aimed at the northwestern tip of the Hawaiian chain - two islets in a low coral atoll known as  Midway .     [ edit ]   Battle of Midway       Main article:  Battle of Midway               Yorktown  in drydock shortly before the Battle of Midway       Armed with this intelligence Admiral Nimitz began methodically planning Midway's defense, rushing all possible reinforcement in the way of men, planes and guns to Midway. In addition, he began gathering his naval forces - comparatively meager as they were - to meet the enemy at sea. As part of those preparations, he recalled TF16,  Enterprise  and  Hornet  (CV-8), to Pearl Harbor for a quick replenishment.   Yorktown , too, received orders to return to Hawaii; and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 27 May. Performing a seeming miracle, yard workers there - laboring around the clock - made enough repairs to enable the ship to put to sea. Her air group - for the most part experienced but weary - was augmented by planes and crews from  Saratoga  (CV-3) which was then headed for Hawaiian waters after her modernization on the west coast. Ready for battle,  Yorktown  sailed as the core of TF17 on 30 May.   Northeast of Midway,  Yorktown , flying Rear Admiral Fletcher's flag, rendezvoused with TF16 under Rear Admiral  Raymond A. Spruance  and maintained a position 10 miles (20 km) to the northward of him.   Patrols, both from Midway itself and from the carriers, proceeded apace during those days in early June. On the morning of the 4th as dawn began to streak the eastern sky,  Yorktown  launched a 10-plane group of Dauntlesses from VB-5 which searched a northern semicircle for a distance of 100 miles (200 km) out but found nothing.   Meanwhile,  PBYs  flying from Midway had sighted the approaching Japanese and broadcast the alarm for the American forces defending the key atoll. Admiral Fletcher, in tactical command, ordered Admiral Spruance's TF16 to locate the enemy carrier force and strike them as soon as they were found.   Yorktown's  search group returned at 0830, landing soon after the last of the six-plane CAP had left the deck. When the last of the Dauntlesses were recovered, the deck was hastily respotted for the launch of the ship's attack group - 17 Dauntlesses from VB-3; 12 Devastators from VT-3, and six Wildcats from ""Fighting Three.""  Enterprise  and  Hornet , meanwhile, launched their attack groups.   The torpedo planes from the three American carriers located the Japanese striking force, but met disaster. Of the 41 planes from VT-8, VT-6, and VT-3, only six returned to  Enterprise  and  Yorktown , collectively. None made it back to  Hornet .   The destruction of the torpedo planes, however, had served a purpose. The Japanese CAP had broken off their high-altitude cover for their carriers and had concentrated on the Devastators, flying ""on the deck."" The skies above were thus left open for Dauntlesses arriving from  Yorktown  and  Enterprise .   Virtually unopposed,  Yorktown's  dive-bombers pummeled  Japanese aircraft carrier  Sry , making three lethal hits with 1,000 pound bombs, turning her into an inferno. [ 2 ]   Enterprise's  planes, meanwhile, hit  Japanese aircraft carrier  Akagi  and  Japanese aircraft carrier  Kaga  - turning them, too into wrecks in short order. The bombs from the Dauntlesses caught all of the Japanese carriers in the midst of refueling and rearming operations, and the combination of bombs and gasoline proved explosive and disastrous to the Japanese.   Three Japanese carriers had been lost. A fourth however, still roamed at large -  Japanese aircraft carrier  Hiry . Separated from her sisters, she launched a striking force of 18 ""Vals"" and soon located  Yorktown .          Smoke pours from  Yorktown  after being hit in the boilers by Japanese dive bombers at Midway.       As soon as the attackers had been picked up on  Yorktown' s radar at about 1329, she discontinued fueling her CAP fighters on deck and swiftly cleared for action. Her returning dive bombers were moved from the landing circle to open the area for antiaircraft fire. The Dauntlesses were ordered aloft to form a CAP. An auxiliary gasoline tank - of 800 gallons capacity - was pushed over the carrier's fantail, eliminating one fire hazard. The crew drained fuel lines and closed and secured all compartments.   All of  Yorktown' s fighters were vectored out to intercept the oncoming Japanese aircraft, and did so some 15 to 20 miles (30 km) out. The Wildcats attacked vigorously, breaking up what appeared to be an organized attack by some 18 ""Vals"" and 18 ""Zeroes."" ""Planes were flying in every direction"", wrote Captain Buckmaster after the action, ""and many were falling in flames."" The leader of the ""Vals"", Lieutenant Joichi Tomonaga, was probably shot down by the  VF-3 's commanding officer,  Lieutenant Commander  John S. Thach. [1] .   Despite an intensive barrage and evasive maneuvering, three ""Vals"" scored hits. Two of them were shot down soon after releasing their bomb loads; the third went out of control just as his bomb left the rack. It tumbled in flight and hit just abaft number two elevator on the starboard side, exploding on contact and blasting a hole about 10 feet (3 m) square in the flight deck. Splinters from the exploding bomb decimated the crews of the two 1.1-inch (28 mm) gun mounts aft of the island and on the flight deck below. Fragments piercing the flight deck hit three planes on the hangar deck, starting fires. One of the aircraft, a  Yorktown  Dauntless, was fully fueled and carrying a 1,000 pound bomb. Prompt action by Lt. A. C. Emerson, the hangar deck officer, prevented a serious conflagration by activating the sprinkler system and quickly extinguishing the fire.   The second bomb to hit the ship came from the port side, pierced the flight deck, and exploded in the lower part of the  funnel . It ruptured the uptakes for three boilers, disabled two boilers themselves, and extinguished the fires in five boilers. Smoke and gases began filling the firerooms of six boilers. The men at number one boiler, however, remained at their post despite their danger and discomfort and kept its fire going, maintaining enough steam pressure to allow the auxiliary steam systems to function.   A third bomb hit the carrier from the starboard side, pierced the side of number one elevator and exploded on the fourth deck, starting a persistent fire in the rag storage space, adjacent to the forward gasoline stowage and the magazines. The prior precaution of smothering the gasoline system with carbon dioxide undoubtedly prevented the gasoline from igniting.   While the ship recovered from the damage inflicted by the dive-bombing attack, her speed dropped to six knots; and then at 14:40, about 20 minutes after the bomb hit that had shut down most of the boilers,  Yorktown  slowed to a stop, dead in the water.   At about 15:40,  Yorktown  prepared to get steaming again; and, at 1550, the engine room force reported that they were ready to make 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h) or better. The ship was not yet out of the fight.   Simultaneously, with the fires controlled sufficiently to warrant the resumption of fueling,  Yorktown  began refueling the fighters then on deck; just then the ship's radar picked up an incoming air group at a distance of 33 miles (53 km). While the ship prepared for battle - again smothering gasoline systems and stopping the fueling of the planes on her flight deck - she vectored four of the six fighters of the CAP in the air to intercept the raiders. Of the 10 fighters on board, eight had as little as 23 gallons of fuel in their tanks. They were launched as the remaining pair of fighters of the CAP headed out to intercept the Japanese planes.           Yorktown  is hit on the port side, amidships, by a Japanese Type 91 aerial torpedo during the mid-afternoon attack by planes from the carrier  Hiryu .       At 16:00, maneuvering  Yorktown  churned forward, making 20 knots (20 mph; 40 km/h). The fighters she had launched and vectored out to intercept had meanwhile made contact with the enemy.  Yorktown  received reports that the planes were ""Kates."" The Wildcats shot down at least three, but the rest began their approach while the carrier and her escorts mounted a heavy antiaircraft barrage.   Yorktown  maneuvered radically, avoiding at least two torpedoes before another two struck the port side within minutes of each other, the first at 16:20. The carrier had been mortally wounded; she lost power and went dead in the water with a jammed rudder and an increasing list to port.   As the list progressed  Commander   C. E. Aldrich , the damage control officer, reported from central station that, without power, controlling the flooding looked impossible. The engineering officer, Lt. Cdr.  J. F. Delaney , soon reported that all fires were out, but all power was lost and it was impossible to correct the list. Buckmaster ordered Aldrich, Delaney, and their men to secure and lay up on deck to put on life jackets.   The list, meanwhile, continued to increase. When it reached 26 degrees, Buckmaster and Aldrich agreed that capsizing was imminent. ""In order to save as many of the ship's company as possible"", the captain wrote later, he ""ordered the ship to be abandoned.""   Over the next few minutes the crew lowered the wounded into life rafts and struck out for the nearby destroyers and cruisers to be picked up by their boats, abandoning ship in good order. After the evacuation of all wounded, the executive officer, Commander  I. D. Wiltsie , left the ship down a line on the starboard side. Buckmaster, meanwhile, toured the ship one last time, to see if any men remained. After finding no ""live personnel"", Buckmaster lowered himself into the water by means of a line over the stern, by which time water was lapping the port side of the hangar deck.     [ edit ]   Salvage and sinking   After being picked up by the destroyer  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , Buckmaster transferred to  USS  Astoria  (CA-34)  and reported to Rear Admiral Fletcher, who had shifted his flag to the heavy cruiser after the first dive-bombing attack. The two men agreed that a salvage party should attempt to save the ship, since she had stubbornly remained afloat despite the heavy list and imminent danger of capsizing.   While efforts to save  Yorktown  had been proceeding apace, her planes were still in action, joining those from  USS  Enterprise  (CV-6)  in striking the last Japanese carrier -  Hiry  - late that afternoon. Taking four direct hits, the Japanese carrier was soon helpless. She was abandoned by her crew and left to drift out of control.   Yorktown , as it turned out, floated throughout the night. Two men were still alive on board her; one attracted attention by firing a machine gun, heard by the sole attending destroyer,  Hughes . The escort picked up the men, one of whom later died.   Meanwhile, Buckmaster had selected 29 officers and 141 men to return to the ship in an attempt to save her. Five destroyers formed an antisubmarine screen while the salvage party boarded the listing carrier, the fire in the rag storage still smouldering on the morning of the 6th.  USS  Vireo  (AT-144) , summoned from  Pearl and Hermes Reef , soon commenced towing the ship. Progress, though, was painfully slow.   Yorktown' s repair party went on board with a carefully predetermined plan of action to be carried out by men from each department - damage control, gunnery air engineering, navigation, communication, supply and medical. To assist in the work, Lt. Cdr.  Arnold E. True  brought his ship,  USS  Hammann  (DD-412) , alongside to starboard, aft, furnishing pumps and electric power.   By mid-afternoon, it looked as if the gamble to save the ship was paying off. The process of reducing topside weight was proceeding well - one 5-inch (127 mm) gun had been dropped over the side, and a second was ready to be cast loose; planes had been pushed over the side; the submersible pumps (powered by electricity provided by  Hammann ) had pumped a lot of water out of the engineering spaces. The efforts of the salvage crew had reduced the list about two degrees.          USS  Hammann  (DD-412) sinking with stern high, after being torpedoed by  Japanese submarine  I-168       Unknown to  Yorktown  and the six nearby destroyers,  Japanese submarine  I-168  had achieved a favorable firing position. Remarkably - but perhaps understandably due to the debris and wreckage in the water in the vicinity - none of the destroyers picked up the approaching I-boat. At 15:36 lookouts spotted a salvo of four torpedoes approaching the ship from the starboard beam.   Hammann  went to general quarters, a 20 millimeter gun going into action in an attempt to explode the torpedoes in the water. One torpedo hit  Hammann  - her screws churning the water beneath her fantail as she tried to get underway - directly amidships and broke her back. The destroyer jackknifed and went down rapidly.   Two torpedoes struck  Yorktown  just below the turn of the bilge at the after end of the island structure. The fourth torpedo passed just astern of the carrier.   About a minute after  Hammann  sank there was an underwater explosion, possibly caused by the destroyer's depth charges going off. The blast killed many of  Hammann's  and a few of  Yorktown's  men who had been thrown into the water. The concussion battered the already-damaged carrier's hull and caused tremendous shocks that carried away  Yorktown's  auxiliary generator, sent numerous fixtures from the hangar deck overhead crashing to the deck below, sheared rivets in the starboard leg of the foremast, and threw men in every direction, causing broken bones and several minor injuries.   All destroyers immediately commenced searches for the enemy submarine (which escaped) and commenced rescuing men from  Hammann  and  Yorktown . Captain Buckmaster decided to postpone further attempts at salvage until the following day.   Vireo  cut the tow and doubled back to  Yorktown  to pick up survivors, taking on board many men of the salvage crew while picking up men from the water. The little ship endured a terrific pounding from the larger ship but nevertheless stayed alongside to carry out her rescue mission. Later, while on board the tug, Buckmaster conducted a burial service, and two officers and an enlisted man from  Hammann  were buried at sea.   The second attempt at salvage was never made. Throughout the night of the 6th and into the morning of the 7th,  Yorktown  remained stubbornly afloat. By 05:30 on 7 June, however, the men in the ships nearby noted that the carrier's list was rapidly increasing to port. At 07:01, the ship turned over onto her port side and sank in 3,000 fathoms (5,500 m) of water, her battle flags flying.     [ edit ]   Honors and rediscovery   Yorktown  (CV-5) earned three  battle stars  for her World War II service, two of them for the significant part she had played in stopping Japanese expansion and turning the tide of the war at Coral Sea and at Midway.   On 19 May 1998, the wreck of  Yorktown  was found and photographed by renowned oceanographer Dr.  Robert D. Ballard , discoverer of the wreck of the  RMS  Titanic . The wreck, 3 miles (5 km) beneath the surface, was surprisingly intact after having been on the sea bottom since 1942much paint and equipment were still visible.

Its 18,049 agents (projected to be over 20,000 by the end of 2009 [ 1 ] ) are primarily responsible for immigration and border law enforcement as codified in the  Immigration and Nationality Act . Their duty is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States and to deter, detect, and apprehend illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who enter the United States other than through designated ports of entry.

The inspectors, usually called ""mounted guards"", operated out of  El Paso, Texas . Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as  California  trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.   In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as ""mounted inspectors"". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the  National Origins Act  and  Chinese Exclusion Act  of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times.  U.S. Army  troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to ""the more serious work of military training."" Non-nationals encountered illegally in the U.S. by the army were directed to the immigration inspection stations.  Texas Rangers  were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as ""singularly effective"".   The Border Patrol was founded on  May 28 ,  1924  as an agency of the  United States Department of Labor  to prevent  illegal entries  along the  MexicoUnited States border . Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to insure that non-American crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the  Eastern Seaboard  during the sixties when Cuba came under dictatorial control and entertained ideas of establishing USSR missile bases there.   Prior to 2003, the Border Patrol was part of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS), an agency that was within the  U.S. Department of Justice . INS was disbanded in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP,  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .   The priority mission of the Border Patrol, as a result of the  9/11 attacks  and its merging into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent  terrorists  and terrorist weapons from entering the  United States of America . However, the Border Patrol's traditional mission remains as the deterrence, detection and apprehension of  illegal immigrants  and individuals involved in the  illegal drug trade  who generally enter the United States other than through designated  ports of entry . The Border Patrol also operates 33 permanent  interior checkpoints  along the southern border of the United States.   Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol employs over 17,600 agents (as of the end of fiscal year 2008), [ 2 ]  who are specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents are assigned primarily to the  MexicoUnited States border , where they are assigned to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration.  [ 3 ]  Patrols on horseback have made a comeback since smugglers have been pushed into the more remote mountainous regions, which are hard to cover with modern tracking strategies. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Strategy     [ edit ]   1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement          Border Patrol Agents with a  HMMWV  and  Astar  patrol for illegal entry into U.S.       The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal immigrants. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal immigrants to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as ""employer sanctions"". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the  Livermore Sector  in Northern California.   Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed  Proposition 187 , denying benefits to illegal immigrants and criminalizing illegal immigrants in possession of forged green cards, I.D. cards and Social Security Numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal immigrants to the  INS . Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.     [ edit ]   Deterrence becomes the new strategy          A U.S. Border Patrol  Ford F-250  pick-up truck at the Tijuana-San Ysidro border crossing. Seen behind the truck is the U.S.-Mexico border fence.       In response to illegal immigration in 1994, the Border Patrol came up with a new strategy for addressing illegal immigrants. In 1992, ""over half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600 border miles13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles (8.0 km) along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico."" [ 5 ]  In 1991,  Office of National Drug Control Policy  commissioned  Sandia National Laboratory  to study more effective ways of stopping the flow of aliens and drugs into the United States. The ""Sandia Study"" concluded that the Border Patrol's traditional method of apprehension was ineffective. The Sandia Study recommended deterrence and the use of technology (cameras) and infrastructure (fences and other barriers) to control illegal immigration and drug smuggling. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Southern border     [ edit ]   El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line   El Paso  Sector Chief Patrol Agent (and future U.S. congressman)  Silvestre Reyes  started a program called ""Operation Hold the Line"". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to  illegal entries  resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande River, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.     [ edit ]   San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper          A Border Patrol  Jeep  stands watch over the  U.S.-Mexico border  at  San Ysidro, California .       San Diego Sector tried  Silvestre Reyes ' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector. [ citation needed ]  In addition, Congressman  Duncan Hunter  obtained surplus military landing mats to use as a border fence. [ citation needed ]  Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. [ citation needed ]  Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as people crossed in different regions.     [ edit ]   Tucson Sector's Operation Safeguard   California was no longer the hotbed of illegal entry and the traffic shifted to Arizona, primarily in  Nogales  and  Douglas . [ citation needed ]  The Border Patrol instituted the same deterrent strategy it used in San Diego to Arizona.     [ edit ]   Northern border   In 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 340 agents assigned along the  Canada  United States border  border. Northern border staffing had been increased to 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a six-fold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.   The northern border sectors are Blaine (Washington), Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Havre (Montana), Houlton (Maine), Spokane (Washington), and Swanton (Vermont).     [ edit ]   Border Patrol moves away from interior enforcement   In the 1990s, Congress mandated that the Border Patrol shift agents away from the interior and focus them on the borders.   After the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the Department of Homeland Security created two immigration enforcement agencies out of the defunct  Immigration and Naturalization Service :  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) and the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal immigrants, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing illegal entries between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP itself is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal authority absolutely nationwide.   In July 2004, the Livermore Sector of the United States Border Patrol was closed. Livermore Sector served Northern California and included stations at  Dublin  ( Parks Reserve Forces Training Area ),  Sacramento ,  Stockton ,  Fresno  and  Bakersfield . The Border Patrol also closed other stations in the interior of the United States including  Roseburg, Oregon  and  Little Rock, Arkansas ]. The Border Patrol functions in these areas consisted largely of local jail and transportation terminal checks for illegal immigrants. These functions were turned over to  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .     [ edit ]   The new strategy          Cameras add ""Smart Border"" surveillance.       In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy. [ 7 ]  The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives:     Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States;   Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement;   Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband;   Use ""smart border"" technology; and   Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.       [ edit ]   Capabilities   The border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by  unmanned aerial vehicles . [ 8 ]   The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is ""Line Watch"". Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities. [ 9 ]   Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics. [ 10 ]   Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft. [ 11 ]   Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components. [ 12 ]   Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch. [ 13 ]  Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.     [ edit ]   Expansion   Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995-2001 attrition spiked to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was doing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely due to agents transferring to the  Federal Air Marshals  after  9/11 . Since that time the attrition problem has decreased significantly and Congress has increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from GS-9 to GS-11 in the  General Schedule  in 2002. In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4%. [ 14 ]   The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004 (signed by President Bush on  December 17 ,  2004 ) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, ""subject to appropriation"". This authorization, if fully implemented, would nearly double the Border Patrol manpower from 11,000 to 21,000 agents by 2010.   In July 2005, Congress signed the  Emergency Supplemental Spending Act  for military operations in Iraq/Afghanistan and other operations. The act also appropriated funding to increase Border Patrol manpower by 500 Agents. In October 2005, President Bush also signed the DHS FY06 Appropriation bill, funding an additional 1,000 Agents.   In November 2005, President George W. Bush made a trip to southern Arizona to discuss more options that would decrease illegal crossings at the U.S. and Mexican border. In his proposed fiscal year 2007 budget he has requested an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents.   The Secure Fence Act, signed by President George W. Bush on  October 26 ,  2006 , has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the 1,945-mile (3,130 km) border, but the act requires only 700 miles (1,100 km) of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence. [ 17 ]  ) Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area. [ 18 ]  Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected due to the fact that a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy. [ 19 ]   Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande River be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.

[ edit ]   Border Patrol Sectors   There are 19 Border Patrol sectors each headed by a Sector Chief Patrol Agent.   Northern Border (West to East):     Spokane  Sector ( Washington )   Havre  Sector ( Montana )   Grand Forks  Sector ( North Dakota )   Detroit  Sector ( Selfridge Air National Guard Base ,  Michigan )   Buffalo  Sector ( New York )   Swanton  Sector ( Vermont )   Houlton  Sector ( Maine )     Southern Border (West to East):     San Diego  Sector (California)   El Centro  Sector ( California )   Yuma  Sector (Western  Arizona )   Tucson  Sector (Eastern Arizona)   El Paso  Sector (Far  West Texas ) and most of  New Mexico )   Marfa  Sector ( West Texas )   Del Rio  Sector ( El Paso, Texas ) - stations; Abilene, Brackettville, Carrizo Springs, Comstock, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Rocksprings, San Angelo, Uvalde   Rio Grande Valley  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Falfurrias, Fort Brown, Harlingen, Kingsville, McAllen, Rio Grande City, Weslaco   Laredo  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Cotulla , Dallas , Freer , Hebbronville , Laredo North , Laredo South , Laredo West , San Antonio , Zapata   New Orleans  Sector ( Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama , and West Florida]])   Miami  Sector ( Florida  East and South)     Caribbean     Ramey  Sector ( Aguadilla ,  Puerto Rico ) and the  Virgin Islands , it is the only Border Patrol Sector located outside the continental United States       [ edit ]   Training   All Border Patrol Agents spend 11 weeks in training at the Border Patrol Academy (if they are fluent in Spanish) in  Artesia, New Mexico , which is a component of the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  (FLETC).Those who are not fluent in Spanish spend an additional eight weeks at the Academy. Recruits are instructed in Border Patrol and federal law enforcement subjects.   Border Patrol courses include: Immigration and Nationality Law, Criminal Law and Statutory Authority, Spanish, Border Patrol Operations, Care and Use of Firearms, Physical Training, Operation of Motor Vehicles, and Anti-Terrorism.   FLETC courses include: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law. [ 22 ]   The physical aspects of the Border Patrol Training Program are extremely demanding. At the end of 55 days, trainees must be able to complete a one and a half mile run in 13 minutes or less, a confidence course in two and a half minutes or less, and a 220 yard dash in 46 seconds or less. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Uniforms   The Border Patrol currently wears the following types of uniforms:          CBP officers at a ceremony in 2007         Dress uniform  The dress uniform consists of  olive green  trousers with a blue stripe, and an olive green shirt, which may or may not have blue shoulder straps. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Ceremonial uniform  When required, the following items are added to the dress uniform to complete the ceremonial uniform: olive green  Ike jacket  or  tunic  with blue accents ( shoulder straps  and  cuffs , blue tie, brass tie tack, white gloves, and olive green felt  campaign hat  with leather hat band. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Rough duty uniform  The rough duty uniform is comprised of dark green work trousers and dark green work shirt (in short or long sleeves). Usually worn with green  baseball cap  or tan  stetson .   Accessories, footwear, and outerwear  Additional items are worn in matching dark green, blue, or black colors as appropriate.   Organization patches  The Border Patrol wears two:    The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a ""keystone"" shape. A ""keystone"" is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.   Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.         The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb. [ 24 ]  Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by ightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

This Award is bestowed to Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty. It is also presented to agents for extraordinary contributions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.   This award is named for Border Patrol Inspectors Newton [ 25 ]  and Azrak, [ 26 ]  who were murdered by two drug smugglers in San Diego County in 1967.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).   Like other law enforcement agencies, the  Remington 870  is the standard shotgun.   Border Patrol Agents also commonly carry the  M4 Carbine  and the  H&K UMP  40 cal.     [ edit ]   Transportation          USBP Air and Marine Intrepid and SafeBoat vessels with a UH-1 Huey near San Diego, Calif.       Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates several thousand  SUVs  and  pickup trucks , which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. This vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as speed radar,  breathalyzers , and emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the  Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor  or the  Dodge Charger  as patrol cars or high speed ""interceptors"" on highways. The Border Patrol also operates  ATVs ,  motorcycles ,  snowmobiles , small boats,  helicopters , and  light aircraft .   Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle or a broad green diagonal stripe on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white.   The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. The  U.S. Border Patrol  has 205 horses As of 2005 [update] . Most are employed along the  MexicoUnited States border . In  Arizona , these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors. The Department of Homeland Security opened up an  internal affairs  investigation into the incident.

The film claimed that this is due to the lack of judicial powers of the Border Patrol and the effective hamstringing of the agency by the  federal government . The film interviews people that deal with illegal immigration on a daily basis, as well as local  citizens  living in the border areas.     [ edit ]   Allegations of abuse     There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the  Houston Journal of International Law  (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the ""serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public"" and that ""illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents"". [ 35 ]       In 1998,  Amnesty International  investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service , and particularly the  Border Patrol . Their report said they found indications of  human rights  violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998. [ 36 ]       An article in  Journal  by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the ""vast majority"" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as ""verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."" [ 37 ]       [ edit ]   Corruption   Incidences of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include:     Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal immigrant, three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document. [ 38 ]  He plead guilty. [ 39 ]   Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal immigrant for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol agent. [ 40 ]   Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose  girlfriend  was an illegal immigrant, he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation. [ 40 ]   Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal immigrant [ 41 ]  who used a fake  birth certificate  to get into the Border Patrol admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal immigrants into the U.S., some of them in his government truck, [ 42 ]  and was helping to smuggle illegal immigrants and charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle immigrants.   An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wire tap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 immigrants at a time. [ 41 ]       [ edit ]   National Border Patrol Council   National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the  labor union  which represents over 14,000 Border Patrol Agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded in 1967, and its parent organization is the  American Federation of Government Employees ,  AFL-CIO . The NBPC's executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol Agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the  Peace Officer Research Association  of  Californias Legal Defense Fund .

According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic was inefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control the border. In addition, the authors said the only good border control strategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border. The study concluded that the way to prevent  illegal entry  is to impose ""effective barriers on the free flow of traffic."" The study noted that where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the United States, they should be stopped at the earliest opportunity. In addition, the Sandia study concluded that ""control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained"" and recommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics from apprehending illegal immigrants after they have entered the United States to preventing illegal entry into the United States.   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^  Nunez-Neto, Blas, Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol, Congressional Research Service, Updated  January 25 ,  2006 ,  [3] , Page 35   ^  Coyle, Marcia.""Waivers for border fence challenged: Environmental groups take their complaints to Supreme Court.""

Focused on slavery and states rights, these issues came to a head following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Over the next several months eleven southern states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America. During the first two years of the war, Southern troops won numerous victories but saw their fortunes turn after losses at Gettysburg and Vicksburg in 1863. From then on, Northern forces worked to conqueror the South, forcing them to surrender in April 1865. Causes & Succession Photo Courtesy of the Library of Congress The roots of the Civil War can be traced to increasing differences between North and South and their growing divergence as the 19th century progressed.  Chief among the issues were expansion of slavery into the territories, the South's declining political power, states rights, and the retention of slavery.  Though these issues had existed for decades, they exploded in 1860 following the election of  Abraham Lincoln  who was against the spread of slavery.  As the result of his election, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas seceded from the Union. More Info First Shots: Fort Sumter & First Bull Run Photograph Courtesy of the National Archives & Records Administration On April 12, 1861, the war began when  Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard  opened fire on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor forcing its surrender.  In response to the attack, President Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion.  While Northern states responded quickly, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas refused, opting to join the Confederacy instead.  In July, Union forces commanded by  Gen. Irvin McDowell  began marching south to take the rebel capital of Richmond.  On the 21st, they met a Confederate army near Manassas and were defeated. More Info The War in East, 1862-1863 Photograph Courtesy of the National Archives & Records Administration Following the defeat at Bull Run,  Gen. George McClellan  was given command of the new Union Army of the Potomac. In early 1862, he shifted south to attack Richmond via the Peninsula. Moving slowly, he was forced to retreat after the Seven Days Battles. This campaign saw the rise of Confederate  Gen. Robert E. Lee . After beating a Union army at Manassas, Lee began to move north into Maryland. McClellan was sent to intercept and won victory at Antietam on the 17th.  Unhappy with McClellan's slow pursuit of Lee, Lincoln gave command to  Gen. Ambrose Burnside . In December, Burnside was beaten at  Fredericksburg  and replaced by  Gen. Joseph Hooker . The following May, Lee engaged and defeated Hooker at Chancellorsville, VA.

Grant  captured Forts Henry &  Donelson . Two months later he defeated a Confederate army at Shiloh, TN. On April 29, Union naval forces  captured New Orleans . To the east, Confederate  Gen. Braxton Bragg  attempted to invade Kentucky, but was repelled at  Perryville  on October 8. That December he was beaten again at Stones River, TN. Grant now focused his attention on capturing Vicksburg and opening the Mississippi River. After a false start, his troops swept through Mississippi and laid siege to the town on May 18, 1863 More Info Turning Points: Gettysburg & Vickburg Photograph Source: Public Domain In June 1863, Lee began to move north towards Pennsylvania with Union troops in pursuit. Following the defeat at Chancellorsville, Lincoln turned to  Gen. George Meade  to take over the Army of the Potomac. On July 1, elements of the two armies clashed at Gettysburg, PA. After three days of heavy fighting, Lee was defeated and forced to retreat. A day later on July 4, Grant successfully concluded the siege of Vicksburg, opening the Mississippi to shipping and cutting the South in two. Combined these victories were the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. More Info The War in the West, 1863-1865 Photograph Source: Public Domain In summer 1863, Union troops under  Gen. William Rosecrans  advanced into Georgia and were defeated at  Chickamauga . Fleeing north, they were besieged at Chattanooga. Grant was ordered to save the situation and did so winning victories at  Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge . The following spring Grant departed and gave command to  Gen. William Sherman . Moving south, Sherman took Atlanta and then  marched to Savannah . After reaching the sea, he moved north pushing Confederate forces until their commander,  Gen. Joseph Johnston  surrendered at Durham, NC on April 18, 1865. More Info The War in the East, 1863-1865 Photograph Courtesy of the National Archives & Records Administration In March 1864, Grant was given command of all Union armies and came east to deal with Lee. Grant's campaign began in May, with the armies clashing at the Wilderness. Despite heavy casualties, Grant pressed south, fighting at Spotsylvania C.H. and Cold Harbor. Unable to get through Lee's army to Richmond, Grant attempted to cut the city off by taking Petersburg. Lee arrived first and a siege began. On April 2/3, 1865, Lee was forced to evacuate the city and retreat west, allowing Grant to take Richmond. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House. More Info Aftermath of the Civil War Photograph Courtesy of the National Archives & Records Administration On April 14, five days after Lee's surrender, President Lincoln was assassinated while attending a play at Ford's Theater in Washington. The assassin,  John Wilkes Booth , was killed by Union troops on April 26 while fleeing south. Following the war, three amendments were added to the Constitution which abolished slavery (13th), extended legal protection regardless of race (14th), and abolished all racial restrictions on voting (15th).     During the war, Union forces suffered approximately 360,000 killed (140,000 in battle) and 282,000 wounded. Confederates armies lost approximately 258,000 killed (94,000 in battle) and an unknown number of wounded. The total killed in the war exceeds the total deaths from all other US wars combined.

Gen. Beauregard, in command of the provisional        Confederate forces at Charleston, South Carolina,        demanded the surrender of the Union garrison of Fort        Sumter in Charleston Harbor. Garrison commander Anderson        refused. On April 12, Confederate batteries opened fire        on the fort, which was unable to reply effectively. At        2:30 pm, April 13, Major Anderson surrendered Fort        Sumter, evacuating the garrison on the following day.        The bombardment of Fort Sumter was the opening        engagement of the American Civil War. Although there        were no casualties during the bombardment, one Union        artillerist was killed and three wounded (one mortally)        when a cannon exploded prematurely while firing a salute        during the evacuation on April 14.                               Bull Run,        July 21, 1861   Casualties = 4,700         This was the first        major land battle of the armies in Virginia. On July 16,        1861, the untried Union army under Brig. Gen. Irvin        McDowell marched from Washington against the Confederate        army, which was drawn up behind Bull Run beyond        Centreville. On the 21st, McDowell crossed at Sudley        Ford and attacked the Confederate left flank on Matthews        Hill. Fighting raged throughout the day as Confederate        forces were driven back to Henry Hill. Late in the        afternoon, Confederate reinforcements (one brigade        arriving by rail from the Shenandoah Valley) extended        and broke the Union right flank. The Federal retreat        rapidly deteriorated into a rout. Although victorious,        Confederate forces were too disorganized to pursue.        Confederate Gen. Bee and Col. Bartow were killed. Thomas        J. Jackson earned the nom de guerre ""Stonewall."" By July        22, the shattered Union army reached the safety of        Washington. This battle convinced the Lincoln        administration that the war would be a long and costly        affair. McDowell was relieved of command of the Union        army and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who        set about reorganizing and training the troops.                     Shiloh,        April 6-7, 1862   Casualties = 23,746         As a result of the        fall of Forts Henry and Donelson, Confederate Gen.        Albert Sidney Johnston, the commander in the area, was        forced to fall back, giving up Kentucky and much of West        and Middle Tennessee. He chose Corinth, Mississippi, a        major transportation center, as the staging area for an        offensive against Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and his        Army of the Tennessee before the Army of the Ohio, under        Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, could join it. The        Confederate retrenchment was a surprise, although a        pleasant one, to the Union forces, and it took Grant,        with about 40,000 men, some time to mount a southern        offensive, along the Tennessee River, toward Pittsburg        Landing. Grant received orders to await Buell Army of        the Ohio at Pittsburg Landing. Grant did not choose to        fortify his position; rather, he set about drilling his        men many of which were raw recruits. Johnston originally        planned to attack Grant on April 4, but delays postponed        it until the 6th. Attacking the Union troops on the        morning of the 6th, the Confederates surprised them,        routing many. Some Federals made determined stands and        by afternoon, they had established a battle line at the        sunken road, known as the ""Hornets Nest."" Repeated Rebel        attacks failed to carry the Hornets Nest, but massed        artillery helped to turn the tide as Confederates        surrounded the Union troops and captured, killed, or        wounded most. Johnston had been mortally wounded earlier        and his second in command, Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, took        over. The Union troops established another line covering        Pittsburg Landing, anchored with artillery and augmented        by Buell men who began to arrive and take up        positions. Fighting continued until after dark, but the        Federals held. By the next morning, the combined Federal        forces numbered about 40,000, outnumbering Beauregard        army of less than 30,000. Beauregard was unaware of the        arrival of Buell army and launched a counterattack in        response to a two-mile advance by William Nelson        division of Buell army at 6:00 am, which was, at        first, successful. Union troops stiffened and began        forcing the Confederates back. Beauregard ordered a        counterattack, which stopped the Union advance but did        not break its battle line. At this point, Beauregard        realized that he could not win and, having suffered too        many casualties, he retired from the field and headed        back to Corinth. On the 8th, Grant sent Brig. Gen.        William T. Sherman, with two brigades, and Brig. Gen.        Thomas J. Wood, with his division, in pursuit of        Beauregard. They ran into the Rebel rearguard, commanded        by Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest, at Fallen Timbers.        Forrest aggressive tactics, although eventually        contained, influenced the Union troops to return to        Pittsburg Landing. Grant mastery of the Confederate        forces continued; he had beaten them once again. The        Confederates continued to fall back until launching        their mid-August offensive.                     2nd Bull        Run, August 28-30, 1862   Casualties = 22,180         In order to draw        Pope army into battle, Jackson ordered an attack on a        Federal column that was passing across his front on the        Warrenton Turnpike on August 28, 1862. The fighting at        Brawner Farm lasted several hours and resulted in a        stalemate. Pope became convinced that he had trapped        Jackson and concentrated the bulk of his army against        him. On August 29, Pope launched a series of assaults        against Jackson position along an unfinished railroad        grade. The attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties        on both sides. At noon, Longstreet arrived on the field        from Thoroughfare Gap and took position on Jackson        right flank. On August 30, Pope renewed his attacks,        seemingly unaware that Longstreet was on the field. When        massed Confederate artillery devastated a Union assault        by Fitz John Porter command, Longstreet wing of        28,000 men counterattacked in the largest, simultaneous        mass assault of the war. The Union left flank was        crushed and the army driven back to Bull Run. Only an        effective Union rearguard action prevented a replay of        the First Manassas disaster. Pope retreat to        Centreville was precipitous, nonetheless. The next day,        Lee ordered his army in pursuit. This was the decisive        battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign.                     Antietam,        September 16-18, 1862   Casualties = estimated 28,000         On September 16, 1862        Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan confronted Lee Army of        Northern Virginia at Sharpsburg, Maryland. At dawn        September 17, Hooker corps mounted a powerful assault        on Lee left flank that began the single bloodiest day        in American military history. Attacks and counterattacks        swept across Miller cornfield and fighting swirled        around the Dunker Church. Union assaults against the        Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center,        but the Federal advantage was not followed up. Late in        the day, Burnside corps finally got into action,        crossing the stone bridge over Antietam Creek and        rolling up the Confederate right. At a crucial moment,        A.P. Hill division arrived from Harpers Ferry and        counterattacked, driving back Burnside and saving the        day. Although outnumbered two-to-one, Lee committed his        entire force, while McClellan sent in less than        three-quarters of his army, enabling Lee to fight the        Federals to a standstill. During the night, both armies        consolidated their lines. In spite of crippling        casualties, Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan        throughout the 18th, while removing his wounded south of        the river. McClellan did not renew the assaults. After        dark, Lee ordered the battered Army of Northern Virginia        to withdraw across the Potomac into the Shenandoah        Valley.                            Fredricksburg, December 11-15, 1862   Casualties =        17,429         On November 14, 1862        Burnside, now in command of the Army of the Potomac,        sent a corps to occupy the vicinity of Falmouth near        Fredericksburg. The rest of the army soon followed. Lee        reacted by entrenching his army on the heights behind        the town. On December 11, Union engineers laid five        pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock under fire. On        the 12th, the Federal army crossed over, and on December        13, Burnside mounted a series of futile frontal assaults        on Prospect Hill and Marye Heights that resulted in        staggering casualties. Meade division, on the Union        left flank, briefly penetrated Jackson line but was        driven back by a counterattack. Union generals C. Feger        Jackson and George Bayard, and Confederate generals        Thomas R.R. Cobb and Maxey Gregg were killed. On        December 15, Burnside called off the offensive and        recrossed the river, ending the campaign. Burnside        initiated a new offensive in January 1863, which quickly        bogged down in the winter mud. The abortive ""Mud March""        and other failures led to Burnside replacement by Maj.        Gen. Joseph Hooker in January 1863.                            Chancellorsville, April 30 thru May 3, 1862   Casualties        = 17,989         On April 27, Maj. Gen.        Joseph Hooker led the V, IX, and XII Corps on a campaign        to turn the Confederate left flank by crossing the        Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers above Fredericksburg.        Passing the Rapidan via Germanna and Ely Fords, the        Federals concentrated near Chancellorsville on April 30        and May 1. The III Corps was ordered to join the army        via United States Ford. Sedgwick VI Corps and Gibbon        division remained to demonstrate against the        Confederates at Fredericksburg. In the meantime, Lee        left a covering force under Maj. Gen. Jubal Early in        Fredericksburg and marched with the rest of the army to        confront the Federals. As Hooker army moved toward        Fredericksburg on the Orange Turnpike, they encountered        increasing Confederate resistance. Hearing reports of        overwhelming Confederate force, Hooker ordered his army        to suspend the advance and to concentrate again at        Chancellorsville. Pressed closely by Lee advance,        Hooker adopted a defensive posture, thus giving Lee the        initiative. On the morning of May 2, Lt. Gen. T.J.        Jackson directed his corps on a march against the        Federal left flank, which was reported to be ""hanging in        the air."" Fighting was sporadic on other portions of the        field throughout the day, as Jackson column reached        its jump-off point. At 5:20 pm, Jackson line surged        forward in an overwhelming attack that crushed the Union        XI Corps. Federal troops rallied, resisted the advance,        and counterattacked. Disorganization on both sides and        darkness ended the fighting. While making a night        reconnaissance, Jackson was mortally wounded by his own        men and carried from the field. J.E.B. Stuart took        temporary command of Jackson Corps. On May 3, the        Confederates attacked with both wings of the army and        massed their artillery at Hazel Grove. This finally        broke the Federal line at Chancellorsville. Hooker        withdrew a mile and entrenched in a defensive ""U"" with        his back to the river at United States Ford. Union        generals Berry and Whipple and Confederate general        Paxton were killed; Stonewall Jackson was mortally        wounded. On the night of May 5-6, after Union reverses        at Salem Church, Hooker recrossed to the north bank of        the Rappahannock. This battle was considered by many        historians to be Lee greatest victory.                     Vicksburg,        May 18 thru July 4, 1863   Casualties = 35,500         In May and June of        1863, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant armies converged on        Vicksburg, investing the city and entrapping a        Confederate army under Lt. Gen. John Pemberton. On July        4, Vicksburg surrendered after prolonged siege        operations. This was the culmination of one of the most        brilliant military campaigns of the war. With the loss        of Pemberton army and this vital stronghold on the        Mississippi, the Confederacy was effectively split in        half. Grant's successes in the West boosted his        reputation, leading ultimately to his appointment as        General-in-Chief of the Union armies.                     Gettysburg,        July 1-3, 1863   Casualties 53,000         Gen. Robert E. Lee        concentrated his full strength against Maj. Gen. George        G. Meade Army of the Potomac at the crossroads county        seat of Gettysburg. On July 1, Confederate forces        converged on the town from west and north, driving Union        defenders back through the streets to Cemetery Hill.        During the night, reinforcements arrived for both sides.        On July 2, Lee attempted to envelop the Federals, first        striking the Union left flank at the Peach Orchard,        Wheatfield, Devil Den, and the Round Tops with        Longstreet and Hill divisions, and then attacking        the Union right at Culp and East Cemetery Hills with        Ewell divisions. By evening, the Federals retained        Little Round Top and had repulsed most of Ewell men.        During the morning of July 3, the Confederate infantry        were driven from their last toe-hold on Culp Hill. In        the afternoon, after a preliminary artillery        bombardment, Lee attacked the Union center on Cemetery        Ridge. The Pickett-Pettigrew assault (more popularly,        Pickett Charge) momentarily pierced the Union line but        was driven back with severe casualties. Stuart cavalry        attempted to gain the Union rear but was repulsed. On        July 4, Lee began withdrawing his army toward        Williamsport on the Potomac River. His train of wounded        stretched more than fourteen miles.                            Chickamauga,  September 18-20, 1863   Casualties =        34,250         After the Tullahoma        Campaign, Rosecrans renewed his offensive, aiming to        force the Confederates out of Chattanooga. The three        army corps comprising Rosecranss army split and set        out for Chattanooga by separate routes. In early        September 1863, Rosecrans consolidated his forces        scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg        army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops        followed it and brushed with it at DavisCross Roads.        Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided        to meet a part of Rosecrans army, defeat them, and        then move back into the city. On the 17th he headed        north, intending to meet and beat the XXI Army Corps. As        Bragg marched north on the 18th, his cavalry and        infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry        which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles. Fighting        began in earnest on the morning of the 19th, and Bragg        men hammered but did not break the Union line. The next        day, Bragg continued his assault on the Union line on        the left, and in late morning, Rosecrans was informed        that he had a gap in his line. In moving units to shore        up the supposed gap, Rosencrans created one, and James        Longstreet men promptly exploited it, driving        one-third of the Union army, including Rosecrans        himself, from the field. George H. Thomas took over        command and began consolidating forces on Horseshoe        Ridge and Snodgrass Hill. Although the Rebels launched        determined assaults on these forces, they held until        after dark. Thomas then led these men from the field        leaving it to the Confederates. The Union retired to        Chattanooga while the Rebels occupied the surrounding        heights.                     Cold Harbor,        May 31 thru June 12, 1864   Casualties = 15,750         On May 31, 1864        Sheridan cavalry seized the vital crossroads of Old        Cold Harbor. Early on June 1, relying heavily on their        new repeating carbines and shallow entrenchments,        Sheridan troopers threw back an attack by Confederate        infantry. Confederate reinforcements arrived from        Richmond and from the Totopotomoy Creek lines. Late on        June 1, the Union VI and XVIII Corps reached Cold Harbor        and assaulted the Confederate works with some success.        By June 2, both armies were on the field, forming on a        seven-mile front that extended from Bethesda Church to        the Chickahominy River. At dawn June 3, the II and XVIII        Corps, followed later by the IX Corps, assaulted along        the Bethesda Church-Cold Harbor line and were        slaughtered at all points. Grant commented in his        memoirs that this was the only attack he wished he had        never ordered. The armies confronted each other on these        lines until the night of June 12, when Grant again        advanced by his left flank, marching to James River. On        June 14, the II Corps was ferried across the river at        Wilcox Landing by transports. On June 15, the rest of        the army began crossing on a 2,200-foot long pontoon        bridge at Weyanoke. Abandoning the well-defended        approaches to Richmond, Grant sought to shift his army        quickly south of the river to threaten Petersburg                                          World History Center                                        "

Bush  in a Border Patrol  dune buggy       The  United States Border Patrol  is a  federal law enforcement agency  within  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), a component of the  Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). Its 18,049 agents (projected to be over 20,000 by the end of 2009) [ 1 ]  are primarily responsible for immigration and border law enforcement as codified in the  Immigration and Nationality Act . Their duty is to prevent terrorists and terrorist weapons from entering the United States and to deter, detect, and apprehend illegal immigrants and individuals involved in the illegal drug trade who enter the United States other than through designated ports of entry.   Additionally, the Border Patrol enforces federal controlled substances laws (as codified in the  Controlled Substances Act ) when violations occur or are found during the enforcement of federal immigration laws, via  delegated authority  from the  Drug Enforcement Administration .

The inspectors, usually called ""mounted guards"", operated out of  El Paso, Texas . Though they never totaled more than 75, they patrolled as far west as  California  trying to restrict the flow of illegal Chinese immigration.   In March 1915, Congress authorized a separate group of mounted guards, often referred to as ""mounted inspectors"". Most rode on horseback, but a few operated automobiles and boats. Although these inspectors had broader arrest authority, they still largely pursued Chinese immigrants trying to avoid the  National Origins Act  and  Chinese Exclusion Act  of 1882. These patrolmen were Immigrant Inspectors, assigned to inspection stations, and could not watch the border at all times.  U.S. Army  troops along the southwest border performed intermittent border patrolling, but this was secondary to ""the more serious work of military training."" Non-nationals encountered illegally in the U.S. by the army were directed to the immigration inspection stations.  Texas Rangers  were also sporadically assigned to patrol duties by the state, and their efforts were noted as ""singularly effective"".   The Border Patrol was founded on  May 28 ,  1924  as an agency of the  United States Department of Labor  to prevent  illegal entries  along the  MexicoUnited States border . Additional operations were established along the Gulf Coast in 1927 to perform crewman control to insure that non-American crewmen departed on the same ship on which they arrived. Additional stations were temporarily added along the Gulf Coast, Florida and the  Eastern Seaboard  during the sixties when Cuba came under dictatorial control and entertained ideas of establishing USSR missile bases there.   Prior to 2003, the Border Patrol was part of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service  (INS), an agency that was within the  U.S. Department of Justice . INS was disbanded in March 2003 when its operations were divided between CBP,  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services , and  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .   The priority mission of the Border Patrol, as a result of the  9/11 attacks  and its merging into the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is to prevent  terrorists  and terrorist weapons from entering the  United States of America . However, the Border Patrol's traditional mission remains as the deterrence, detection and apprehension of  illegal immigrants  and individuals involved in the  illegal drug trade  who generally enter the United States other than through designated  ports of entry . The Border Patrol also operates 33 permanent  interior checkpoints  along the southern border of the United States.   Currently, the U.S. Border Patrol employs over 17,600 agents (as of the end of fiscal year 2008), [ 2 ]  who are specifically responsible for patrolling the 6,000 miles of Mexican and Canadian international land borders and 2,000 miles of coastal waters surrounding the Florida Peninsula and the island of Puerto Rico. Agents are assigned primarily to the  MexicoUnited States border , where they are assigned to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. [ 3 ]  Patrols on horseback have made a comeback since smugglers have been pushed into the more remote mountainous regions, which are hard to cover with modern tracking strategies. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Strategy     [ edit ]   1986: Employer sanctions and interior enforcement          Border Patrol Agents with a  HMMWV  and  Astar  patrol for illegal entry into U.S.       The Border Patrol's priorities have changed over the years. In 1986, the  Immigration Reform and Control Act  placed renewed emphasis on controlling illegal immigration by going after the employers that hire illegal immigrants. The belief was that jobs were the magnet that attracted most illegal immigrants to come to the United States. The Border Patrol increased interior enforcement and Form I-9 audits of businesses through an inspection program known as ""employer sanctions"". Several agents were assigned to interior stations, such as within the  Livermore Sector  in Northern California.   Employer sanctions never became the effective tool it was expected to be by Congress. Illegal immigration continued to swell after the 1986 amnesty despite employer sanctions. By 1993, Californians passed  Proposition 187 , denying benefits to illegal immigrants and criminalizing illegal immigrants in possession of forged green cards, I.D. cards and Social Security Numbers. It also authorized police officers to question non-nationals as to their immigration status and required police and sheriff departments to cooperate and report illegal immigrants to the  INS . Proposition 187 drew nationwide attention to illegal immigration.     [ edit ]   Deterrence becomes the new strategy          A U.S. Border Patrol  Ford F-250  pick-up truck at the Tijuana-San Ysidro border crossing. Seen behind the truck is the U.S.-Mexico border fence.       In response to illegal immigration in 1994, the Border Patrol came up with a new strategy for addressing illegal immigrants. In 1992, ""over half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600 border miles13 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles (8.0 km) along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico."" [ 5 ]  In 1991,  Office of National Drug Control Policy  commissioned  Sandia National Laboratory  to study more effective ways of stopping the flow of aliens and drugs into the United States. The ""Sandia Study"" concluded that the Border Patrol's traditional method of apprehension was ineffective. The Sandia Study recommended deterrence and the use of technology (cameras) and infrastructure (fences and other barriers) to control illegal immigration and drug smuggling. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Southern border     [ edit ]   El Paso Sector's Operation Hold the Line   El Paso  Sector Chief Patrol Agent (and future U.S. congressman)  Silvestre Reyes  started a program called ""Operation Hold the Line"". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to  illegal entries  resulting in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea was that it would be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande River, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced illegal entries in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the illegal entries to other areas.     [ edit ]   San Diego Sector's Operation Gatekeeper          A Border Patrol  Jeep  stands watch over the  U.S.-Mexico border  at  San Ysidro, California .       San Diego Sector tried  Silvestre Reyes ' approach of forward deploying agents to deter illegal entries into the country. Congress authorized the hiring of thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector. [ citation needed ]  In addition, Congressman  Duncan Hunter  obtained surplus military landing mats to use as a border fence. [ citation needed ]  Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. [ citation needed ]  Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as people crossed in different regions.     [ edit ]   Tucson Sector's Operation Safeguard   California was no longer the hotbed of illegal entry and the traffic shifted to Arizona, primarily in  Nogales  and  Douglas . [ citation needed ]  The Border Patrol instituted the same deterrent strategy it used in San Diego to Arizona.     [ edit ]   Northern border   In 2001, the Border Patrol had approximately 340 agents assigned along the  Canada  United States border  border. Northern border staffing had been increased to 1,128 agents to 1,470 agents by the end of fiscal year 2008, and is projected to expand to 1,845 by the end of fiscal year 2009, a sixfold increase. Resources that support Border Patrol agents include the use of new technology and a more focused application of air and marine assets.   The northern border sectors are Blaine (Washington), Buffalo (New York), Detroit (Selfridge ANGB, Michigan), Grand Forks (North Dakota), Havre (Montana), Houlton (Maine), Spokane (Washington), and Swanton (Vermont).     [ edit ]   Border Patrol moves away from interior enforcement   In the 1990s, Congress mandated that the Border Patrol shift agents away from the interior and focus them on the borders.   After the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the Department of Homeland Security created two immigration enforcement agencies out of the defunct  Immigration and Naturalization Service :  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) and the  U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal immigrants, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing illegal entries between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP itself is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal authority absolutely nationwide.   In July 2004, the Livermore Sector of the United States Border Patrol was closed. Livermore Sector served Northern California and included stations at  Dublin  ( Parks Reserve Forces Training Area ),  Sacramento ,  Stockton ,  Fresno  and  Bakersfield . The Border Patrol also closed other stations in the interior of the United States including  Roseburg, Oregon  and  Little Rock, Arkansas ]. The Border Patrol functions in these areas consisted largely of local jail and transportation terminal checks for illegal immigrants. These functions were turned over to  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .     [ edit ]   The new strategy          Cameras add ""Smart Border"" surveillance.       In November 2005, the U.S. Border Patrol published an updated national strategy. [ 7 ]  The goal of this updated strategy is operational control of the United States border. The strategy has five main objectives:     Apprehend terrorists and terrorist weapons illegally entering the United States;   Deter illegal entries through improved enforcement;   Detect, apprehend, and deter smugglers of humans, drugs, and other contraband;   Use ""smart border"" technology; and   Reduce crime in border communities, improving quality of life.       [ edit ]   Capabilities   The border is a barely discernible line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes a variety of equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect illegal entries. Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by  unmanned aerial vehicles . [ 8 ]   The primary activity of a Border Patrol Agent is ""Line Watch"". Line Watch involves the detection, prevention, and apprehension of terrorists, undocumented aliens and smugglers of aliens at or near the land border by maintaining surveillance from a covert position; following up on leads; responding to electronic sensor television systems and aircraft sightings; and interpreting and following tracks, marks, and other physical evidence. Major activities include traffic check, traffic observation, city patrol, transportation check, administrative, intelligence, and anti-smuggling activities. [ 9 ]   Traffic checks are conducted on major highways leading away from the border to detect and apprehend illegal aliens attempting to travel further into the interior of the United States after evading detection at the border, and to detect illegal narcotics. [ 10 ]   Transportation checks are inspections of interior-bound conveyances, which include buses, commercial aircraft, passenger and freight trains, and marine craft. [ 11 ]   Marine Patrols are conducted along the coastal waterways of the United States, primarily along the Pacific coast, the Caribbean, the tip of Florida, and Puerto Rico and interior waterways common to the United States and Canada. Border Patrol conducts border control activities from 130 marine craft of various sizes. The Border Patrol maintains watercraft ranging from blue-water craft to inflatable-hull craft, in 16 sectors, in addition to headquarters special operations components. [ 12 ]   Horse and bike patrols are used to augment regular vehicle and foot patrols. Horse units patrol remote areas along the international boundary that are inaccessible to standard all-terrain vehicles. Bike patrol aids city patrol and is used over rough terrain to support linewatch. [ 13 ]  Snowmobiles are used to patrol remote areas along the northern border in the winter.     [ edit ]   Expansion   Attrition in the Border Patrol was normally at 5%. From 1995-2001 attrition spiked to above 10%, which was a period when the Border Patrol was undergoing massive hiring. In 2002 the attrition rate climbed to 18%. The 18% attrition was largely due to agents transferring to the  Federal Air Marshals  after  9/11 . Since that time the attrition problem has decreased significantly and Congress has increased journeyman Border Patrol Agent pay from GS-9 to GS-11 in the  General Schedule  in 2002. In 2005, Border Patrol attrition dropped to 4%. [ 14 ]   The  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004 (signed by President Bush on  December 17 ,  2004 ) authorized hiring an additional 10,000 agents, ""subject to appropriation"". This authorization, if fully implemented, would nearly double the Border Patrol manpower from 11,000 to 21,000 agents by 2010.   In July 2005, Congress signed the  Emergency Supplemental Spending Act  for military operations in Iraq/Afghanistan and other operations. The act also appropriated funding to increase Border Patrol manpower by 500 Agents. In October 2005, President Bush also signed the DHS FY06 Appropriation bill, funding an additional 1,000 Agents.   In November 2005, President George W. Bush made a trip to southern Arizona to discuss more options that would decrease illegal crossings at the U.S. and Mexican border. In his proposed fiscal year 2007 budget he has requested an additional 1,500 Border Patrol agents.   The Secure Fence Act, signed by President George W. Bush on  October 26 ,  2006 , has met with much opposition. In October 2007, environmental groups and concerned citizens filed a restraining order hoping to halt the construction of the fence, set to be built between the United States and Mexico. The act mandates that the fence be built by December 2008. Ultimately, the United States seeks to put fencing around the 1,945-mile (3,130 km) border, but the act requires only 700 miles (1,100 km) of fencing. DHS secretary Michael Chertoff has bypassed environmental and other oppositions with a waiver that was granted to him by Congress in Section 102 of the act, which allows DHS to avoid any conflicts that would prevent a speedy assembly of the fence. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   This action has led many environment groups and landowners to speak out against the impending construction of the fence. [ 17 ]  Environment and wildlife groups fear that the plans to clear brush, construct fences, install bright lights, motion sensors, and cameras will scare wildlife and endanger the indigenous species of the area. [ 18 ]  Environmentalists claim that the ecosystem could be affected due to the fact that a border fence would restrict movement of all animal species, which in turn would keep them from water and food sources on one side or another. Desert plants would also feel the impact, as they would be uprooted in many areas where the fence is set to occupy. [ 19 ]   Property owners in these areas fear a loss of land. Landowners would have to give some of their land over to the government for the fence. Citizens also fear that communities will be split. Many students travel over the border every day to attend classes at the University of Texas at Brownsville. Brownsville mayor Pat Ahumada favors alternative options to a border fence. He suggests that the Rio Grande River be widened and deepened to provide for a natural barrier to hinder illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.

[ edit ]   Border Patrol Sectors   There are 20 Border Patrol sectors, each headed by a Sector Chief Patrol Agent.   Northern Border (West to East):     Spokane  Sector ( Western Washington State )   Spokane  Sector ( Eastern Washington State )   Havre  Sector ( Montana )   Grand Forks  Sector ( North Dakota )   Detroit  Sector ( Selfridge Air National Guard Base ,  Michigan )   Buffalo  Sector ( New York )   Swanton  Sector ( Vermont )   Houlton  Sector ( Maine )     Southern Border (West to East):     San Diego  Sector (San Diego, California)   El Centro  Sector ( Imperial County, California )   Yuma  Sector (Western  Arizona )   Tucson  Sector (Eastern Arizona)   El Paso  Sector (  El Paso, Texas  and  New Mexico )   Marfa  Sector ( Big Bend Area of West Texas )   Del Rio  Sector ( El Paso, Texas ) - stations; Abilene, Brackettville, Carrizo Springs, Comstock, Del Rio, Eagle Pass, Rocksprings, San Angelo, Uvalde   Rio Grande Valley  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Falfurrias, Fort Brown, Harlingen, Kingsville, McAllen, Rio Grande City, Weslaco   Laredo  Sector ( South Texas ) - stations; Cotulla , Dallas , Freer , Hebbronville , Laredo North , Laredo South , Laredo West , San Antonio , Zapata   New Orleans  Sector ( Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama , and West Florida]])   Miami  Sector ( Florida  East and South)     Caribbean     Ramey  Sector ( Aguadilla ,  Puerto Rico ) and the  Virgin Islands , it is the only Border Patrol Sector located outside the continental United States       [ edit ]   Training   All Border Patrol Agents spend 11 weeks in training at the Border Patrol Academy (if they are fluent in Spanish) in  Artesia, New Mexico , which is a component of the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Center  (FLETC).Those who are not fluent in Spanish spend an additional eight weeks at the Academy. Recruits are instructed in Border Patrol and federal law enforcement subjects.   Border Patrol courses include: Immigration and Nationality Law, Criminal Law and Statutory Authority, Spanish, Border Patrol Operations, Care and Use of Firearms, Physical Training, Operation of Motor Vehicles, and Anti-Terrorism.   FLETC courses include: Communications, Ethics and Conduct, Report Writing, Introduction to Computers, Fingerprinting, and Constitutional Law. [ 22 ]   The physical aspects of the Border Patrol Training Program are extremely demanding. At the end of 55 days, trainees must be able to complete a one and a half mile run in 13 minutes or less, a confidence course in two and a half minutes or less, and a 220 yard dash in 46 seconds or less. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Uniforms   The Border Patrol currently wears the following types of uniforms:          CBP officers at a ceremony in 2007         Dress uniform  The dress uniform consists of brown-gray trousers with a blue-gray stripe, and an brown-gray shirt, which may or may not have blue-gray shoulder straps. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Ceremonial uniform  When required, the following items are added to the dress uniform to complete the ceremonial uniform: brown-gray Ike jacket  or  tunic  with blue-gray accents ( shoulder straps  and  cuffs , blue tie, brass tie tack, white gloves, and brown-gray felt  campaign hat  with leather hat band. The  campaign hat  is worn with uniform.   Rough duty uniform  The rough duty uniform consists of black work trousers and work shirt (in short or long sleeves). Usually worn with black  baseball cap  or gray  stetson .   Accessories, footwear, and outerwear  Additional items are worn in matching blue-gray or black colors as appropriate.   Organization patches  The Border Patrol wears two:    The CBP patch is worn on the right sleeves of the uniform. It contains the DHS seal against a black background with a ""keystone"" shape. A ""keystone"" is the central, wedge-shaped stone in an arch, which holds all the other stones in place.   Border Patrol agents retain the circular legacy Border Patrol patch, which is worn on the left sleeve.         The Border Patrol uniform is getting its first makeover since the 1950s to appear more like military fatigues and less like a police officer's duty garb. [ 24 ]  Leather belts with brass buckles are being replaced by nylon belts with quick-release plastic buckles, slacks are being replaced by lightweight cargo pants, and shiny badges and nameplates are being replaced by cloth patches.

This Award is bestowed to Border Patrol agents killed in the line of duty. It is also presented to agents for extraordinary contributions, service; accomplishments reflecting unusual courage or bravery in the line of duty; or an extraordinarily heroic or humane act committed during times of extreme stress or in an emergency.   This award is named for Border Patrol Inspectors Newton [ 25 ]  and Azrak, [ 26 ]  who were murdered by two drug smugglers in San Diego County in 1967.

It can contain as many as 13 rounds of ammunition (12 in the magazine and one in the chamber).   Like other law enforcement agencies, the  Remington 870  is the standard shotgun.   Border Patrol Agents also commonly carry the  M4 Carbine  and the  H&K UMP  40 cal.     [ edit ]   Transportation          USBP Air and Marine Intrepid and SafeBoat vessels with a UH-1 Huey near San Diego, Calif.       Unlike in many other law enforcement agencies in the United States, the Border Patrol operates several thousand  SUVs  and  pickup trucks , which are known for their capabilities to move around in any sort of terrain. This vehicles may have individual revolving lights (strobes or LEDs) and/or light bars and sirens. An extensive modernization drive has ensured that these vehicles are equipped with wireless sets in communication with a central control room. Border Patrol vehicles may also have equipment such as speed radar,  breathalyzers , and emergency first aid kits. Some sectors make use of sedans like the  Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor  or the  Dodge Charger  as patrol cars or high speed ""interceptors"" on highways. The Border Patrol also operates  ATVs ,  motorcycles ,  snowmobiles , small boats,  helicopters , and  light aircraft .   Color schemes of Border Patrol vehicles are either a long green stripe running the length of the vehicle or a broad green diagonal stripe on the door. Most Border Patrol vehicles are painted predominantly white.   The Border Patrol also extensively uses horses for remote area patrols. The  U.S. Border Patrol  has 205 horses As of 2005 [update] . Most are employed along the  MexicoUnited States border . In  Arizona , these animals are fed special processed feed pellets so that their wastes do not spread non-native plants in the national parks and wildlife areas they patrol.

Agents stationed at  Ajo, Arizona  said that the Mexican soldiers crossed the border into an isolated area southwest of Tucson and pointed rifles at the agent, who has not been identified. The Mexicans withdrew after other American agents arrived on the scene. [ 29 ]     [ edit ]   Ramos and Compean   In February 2005, Border Patrol Agents  Ignacio Ramos  and  Jose Compean  were involved in an incident while pursuing a van in  Fabens, Texas . The driver, later identified as Aldrete Davila, was shot by Agent Ramos during a scuffle. Davila escaped back into Mexico, and the agents discovered that the van contained a million dollars worth of marijuana (about 750 pounds). None of the agents at the scene orally reported the shooting, including two supervisors. The Department of Homeland Security opened up an  internal affairs  investigation into the incident.

The film claimed that this is due to the lack of judicial powers of the Border Patrol and the effective hamstringing of the agency by the  federal government . The film interviews people that deal with illegal immigration on a daily basis, as well as local  citizens  living in the border areas.     [ edit ]   Allegations of abuse     There are allegations of abuse by the United States Border Patrol such as the ones reported by Jesus A. Trevino, that concludes in an article published in the  Houston Journal of International Law  (2006) with a request to create an independent review commission to oversee the actions of the Border Patrol, and that creating such review board will make the American public aware of the ""serious problem of abuse that exists at the border by making this review process public"" and that ""illegal immigrants deserve the same constitutionally-mandated humane treatment of citizens and legal residents"". [ 35 ]       In 1998,  Amnesty International  investigated allegations of ill-treatment and brutality by officers of the  Immigration and Naturalization Service , and particularly the  Border Patrol . Their report said they found indications of  human rights  violations during 1996, 1997 and early 1998. [ 36 ]       An article in  Journal  by Michael Huspek, Leticia Jimenez, Roberto Martinez (1998) cites that in December 1997, John Case, head of the INS Office of Internal Audit, announced at a press conference that public complaints to the INS had risen 29% from 1996, with the ""vast majority"" of complaints emanating from the southwest border region, but that of the 2,300 cases, the 243 cases of serious allegations of abuse were down in 1997. These serious cases are considered to be distinct from less serious complaints, such as ""verbal abuse, discrimination, extended detention without cause."" [ 37 ]       [ edit ]   Corruption   Incidences of corruption in the U.S. Border Patrol include:     Pablo Sergio Barry, an agent charged with one count of harboring an illegal immigrant, three counts of false statements, and two counts of making a false document. [ 38 ]  He plead guilty. [ 39 ]   Christopher E. Bernis, an agent indicted on a charge of harboring an illegal immigrant for nine months while employed as a U.S. Border Patrol agent. [ 40 ]   Jose De Jesus Ruiz, an agent whose  girlfriend  was an illegal immigrant, he was put on administrative leave pending an investigation. [ 40 ]   Oscar Antonio Ortiz, an illegal immigrant [ 41 ]  who used a fake  birth certificate  to get into the Border Patrol admitted to smuggling more than 100 illegal immigrants into the U.S., some of them in his government truck, [ 42 ]  and was helping to smuggle illegal immigrants and charged with conspiring with another agent to smuggle immigrants.   An unidentified patrol agent who was recorded on a wire tap stating that he helped to smuggle 30 to 50 immigrants at a time. [ 41 ]       [ edit ]   National Border Patrol Council   National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) is the  labor union  which represents over 14,000 Border Patrol Agents and support staff. The NBPC was founded in 1967, and its parent organization is the  American Federation of Government Employees ,  AFL-CIO . The NBPC's executive committee is staffed by current and retired Border Patrol Agents and, along with its constituent locals, employs a staff of a dozen attorneys and field representatives. The NBPC is associated with the  Peace Officer Research Association  of  Californias Legal Defense Fund .

According to the Sandia study's authors, this tactic was inefficient and diminished the Border Patrol's ability to control the border. In addition, the authors said the only good border control strategy is one that prevents people from crossing the border. The study concluded that the way to prevent  illegal entry  is to impose ""effective barriers on the free flow of traffic."" The study noted that where it is not possible or practical to keep drugs and illegal immigrants from entering the United States, they should be stopped at the earliest opportunity. In addition, the Sandia study concluded that ""control of the illegal alien and drug traffic can be gained"" and recommended that the Border Patrol change its tactics from apprehending illegal immigrants after they have entered the United States to preventing illegal entry into the United States.   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/national_bp_strategy.ctt/national_bp_strategy.pdf   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/who_we_are.xml   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^   http://www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/border_security/border_patrol/border_patrol_ohs/overview.xm   ^  Nunez-Neto, Blas, Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol, Congressional Research Service, Updated  January 25 ,  2006 ,  [3] , Page 35   ^  Coyle, Marcia.""Waivers for border fence challenged: Environmental groups take their complaints to Supreme Court.""

American Border Patrol has the answers       WASHINGTON, Jan. 9, 2009 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S.-Mexico      border has been under private aerial surveillance for the past      two years. Every sixty days a specially equipped aircraft has      flown along the border from Texas to the Pacific Ocean,      documenting the construction of the border fence. The results of      this survey, including surprising findings related to the drug      war in Mexico, will be presented at the National Press Club on      January 15, 2009.       Entitled, ""The border fence, where is it and does it work?""      the presentation will be made by Glenn Spencer, pilot of the      aerial surveillance aircraft and president of American Border      Patrol, sponsors of the surveillance project, called Operation      B.E.E.F. (Border Enforcement Evaluation First). ABP is a      non-profit 501 c (3) Arizona corporation.       Spencer will review the recent history of the border fence,      including the double fence at San Diego and new fencing along      the Texas/Mexico border as of his most recent aerial survey      conducted on January 6, 2009. Spencer will show that, when      properly designed, a fence system can cut border apprehensions      by more than 95%.       A special segment of the report called ""The light at the end      of the tunnel""       will show a strong correlation between the construction of      the border fence and drug-related deaths in Mexico between 2005      and 2009.       The audience will be presented with the most authoritative      assessment of the border fence project ever made.
