One of the most important tasks of paralegals are to help the lawyers to prepare for hearings, trials, corporate meetings and closings. Paralegals perform the background investigation into the facts of the case and make sure that all the important information has been considered. In addition to this preparatory work, they perform a number of other important functions. For instance, they help in drafting contracts, separation agreements, instruments of trust and mortgages.  Areas Of Work Many organizations require the expertise of paralegals. Law firms, legal departments of large corporate houses and government offices employ the services of paralegals. Within these organizations, they work in different aspects of applied law, such as corporate law, personal injury, real estate, family law, employee benefits and even criminal law. Since law has increased in complexity, paralegals now also specialize in their services. Paralegals in corporations and the public sector usually work a standard 40-hour week.  Training There are a number of ways to become a paralegal. The most common is a paralegal program at a community college that matures into an associate's degree. The other common method is through a program of certification in paralegal studies. Bachelor's and master's degrees in paralegal studies are also available at a number of schools. Some employers also train paralegals. They hire college graduates with no legal experience and train them hands-on.  Nearly 1000 colleges and universities, proprietary schools and law schools offer formal paralegal training. Graduation from a program with ABA (American Bar Association) approval can enhance employment opportunities. Familiarity with technical knowledge and the working of computers are also essential in paralegal work. The Internet and computer software are regularly used to research legal literature and save databases. Therefore, a course in computer operations can be extremely useful and is virtually essential. Job Outlook Employment for paralegals is expected to grow much faster in the future. Employers are trying to cut costs by hiring paralegals to take care of a number of tasks that were earlier performed by lawyers. Experienced and formally trained paralegals have the best employment opportunities. Insurance companies, banks, real estate agencies and title insurance firms are now hiring paralegals. The demand for paralegals will increase with the expanding population's demand for legal services. Earning Prospects Earnings of paralegals and legal assistants vary. Salaries are based on experience, education, training, the type and size of the employing company and the geographic location. In general, paralegals working for large legal firms or in large cities and metropolitan areas usually earn more than those who work within smaller firms or in remote regions. In addition to the salary, many companies offer a system of bonus to paralegals. The average starting salary can be anything around $30,000. Even the lowest paid is close to $26,000, while the top make as much as $60,000 or more. After five years of experience, the average salary increases. The average paralegal salary for the top bracket can increase to as much as $80,000 in five years.  If you have an analytical mind, and like law, then a career as a paralegal can prove to be immensely satisfying.    About the Author     Tony Jacowski is a quality analyst for The MBA Journal.

Web.com's services included do-it-yourself and professional website design, web hosting,  e-commerce , web marketing, and e-mail. As of March 2007, there were approximately 166,000 paid hosting subscribers in 2007 [ 1 ] .   Along with various web products and services, Web.com provided small businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers with advice and tips for developing a strong online presence. [ 2 ]  It owned the brands Web.com, Interland,  Trellix , and Hostpro.   On September 30, 2007, Web.com merged with  Website Pros . [ 3 ]           Contents       1   History   2   Legal   3   Website Pros   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   The Company was founded as  MicronPC , a multi-billion PC manufacturer but later merged with Interland, which was another public company based in Atlanta, GA. The combined company changed its name to Interland and sold the PC business to focus on Internet hosting. Interland's primary business was providing web services, such as shared and dedicated hosting. Interland acquired numerous hosting companies between the years 2001 and 2006, including HostPro, Innerhost, Dialtone, Interland, Burlee,  Trellix , Communitech and WazooWeb. The company acquired Web.com in December 2005 for $4.8 million and changed its name from Interland to Web.com.  [ 4 ]  In August 2005, Interlands Board of Directors decided to bring in new management with the goal of turning around the company. It removed its former CEO,  Joel Kocher , and replaced him with  Jeff Stibel .  [ 5 ]  Over the next several months the company also brought in a new Chief Technology Officer, Vikas Rijsinghani (former founder and CTO of VerticalOne) and a new Chief Marketing Officer, Judy Hackett (former CMO of CareerBuilder).  [ 6 ]   Web.com held 21 registered patents and claimed to have the primary underlying technology for various aspects of web hosting, software as a service, customer-facing control panels, and website builders.  [ 7 ]  Some of these patents were licensed to Hostopia, a wholesale web hosting provider.  [ 8 ]  On  February 1 ,  2007 ,  Netcraft  named Web.com one of the most reliable hosting companies.  [ 9 ]   When the company was known as Interland, the stock had risen to meteoric levels and then suffered with the "" Dot-com bubble "" and was ranked among the 10 worst performances for a United States listed company.  [ 10 ]  But since the company brought on new management and changed its name to Web.com, the stock price recovered. At the time of the merger with Website Pros, the company's stock closed at $7.15, which represented more than a threefold increase since new management joined in August of 2005. [ 11 ]  According to the companys financials, the last four quarters showed revenue and subscriber growth at Web.com, despite having consistently lost revenues and subscribers prior to the turnaround.  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  During the first quarter of 2007, the company announced a profit and earnings growth but the second quarter of 2007 the company reported a loss, mainly due to merger related costs [ 15 ] .     [ edit ]   Legal   The company had been involved with various lawsuits, some of these predate the web.com acquisition:     Novell brought an action against Interland in 1999 claiming underpayment of royalties. It made an out-of-court  settlement  in 2005. [ 16 ]   The company made a claim against an insurer in 2000. The amount was settled, and Web.com received $6 million dollars. [ 17 ]   In June 2006, Web.com filed a law suit against  GoDaddy , which alleges that GoDaddy's hosting and domain plans infringed on Web.com's patents. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   WebSource Media was acquired by the company on  May 24 ,  2006 [ 20 ]  but by  June 23 , Web.com filed to rescind the acquisition when it learned that WebSource had engaged in ""unfair and deceptive acts and business practices"". Web.com was appointed to manage the business operations as an agent of the receiver when the court ordered that it be managed by a receiver. [ 21 ]       [ edit ]   Website Pros   On June 26, 2007, Website Pros and Web.com announced that ""the two companies have signed a definitive merger agreement"". Website Pros, as the bigger of the two companies, acquired Web.com for a total of approximately ~$130 million, consisting of $25 million in cash and the rest in stock. Web.com representatives, including Jeff Stibel as the new  President , will hold two of seven seats on Website Pro's Board. [ 3 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The merger was completed on October1st, 2007. [ 24 ]  Prior to the Web.com merger, Website Pros had acquired: 1ShoppingCart.com,  LEADS.com , NetObjects,  Renovation Experts.com , and Submitawebsite.

But theyre tough to write, so people either tell themselves that not sending one doesnt matter, or they procrastinate until its too late and almost pointless anyway.  But anyone who tells themselves that foregoing a fundamental rule of etiquette doesnt matter, not only taints themselves in the mind of the interviewer, but misses two additional opportunities to sell.    A thank you letter is an additional sales piece.  As Ive said before, youre selling a product and the product is you.  So beyond the reason of etiquette, the letter sells you as a polite person who recognizes that the interviewer gave them something valuable:  time and consideration.     A fundamental rule of sales is to keep the product in front of the buyer and reinforce its benefits.  So beyond the etiquette, the letter gives you ample space to comment on what you liked about the company, why your skills are of benefit to them, and how much youre interested.   If something wasnt tied up, or was left unsatisfactorily, you should use the space to further address the issue.   When you miss the opportunity to reinforce your skills and tie them to the job requirements, you miss a chance to sell.  When you fail to address a concern or answer a question and leave it to fester in the mind of the interviewer, youve failed to overcome an objection.  And if a buyer has an objection to the product, if it isnt addressed, the likelihood of the sale is slim.   The third opportunity missed by skipping the thank you letter is the chance to keep your name in front of the buyer.  Read newspapers?  Watch TV?  See the same ads over and over and over again?  Its somewhat the same principle  if you keep your name in front of the hiring authority, theyre more likely to remember you.     Thank you letters are one of the reasons its important to take notes during an interview.  Not only does it show good attention to detail, it saves you from having to scrunch your face up trying to remember some of the information you learned about the company and position during the interview.  Because if you met with three separate people during one visit to the company, thats three thank you letters&.three different thank you letters.   So lets look at how to create one of these so that it becomes a less odious task.    "" First paragraph  Open with the obligatory thank you and include how you enjoyed the meeting.  Say why.  Maybe the people you met were exceptional.  Perhaps their company philosophy was exactly what you had hoped for.  Or they need to overhaul a department and you cant wait to sink your teeth into it because thats what youve got a stellar track record of doing.  It doesnt matter.  Pick something out, and put it down.  But make it real.     "" Second paragraph  What took place during your interview?  Pull out a piece of information that pleased you, say what it was, and tell them why.  For instance:  I was particularly pleased to find that X company/the opportunity/your management style has/was/is/does whatever.  This is exciting because&& .  You can expand on whatever it is for a few sentences by elaborating:  how it relates to something youve experienced and liked -- or didnt like.  Discuss a particular aspect of the job you find appealing and reiterate why youd be successful at it or how long youve been performing it or how similar it is to something youve done in the past.       "" Third paragraph  You can add a similar paragraph if the second was fairly short.  Or you can wind it up if it was a bit lengthy.  If there was something that came up that needed clarification or about which they were dubious, address it and clear it up here.   "" Fourth paragraph  Wind it up. Re-iterate your interest.  Be enthusiastic!  Leave the job speak behind.  If you really want to be hired, let your interest shine through.  Theres nothing wrong with coming right out and saying, Id love  to work with X company!       Caution:  Dont start every sentence with I.  It may be the easiest way to write the letter but its not only repetitive, its a turn off and egotistical.   This process is about you getting a job, but its about what they get out of it if they hire you.   If you really want the job, the letter will be easy to write because it will contain genuine impressions and sentiments.   If you choose to skip the letter, perhaps you dont care if youre hired or not. But make that decision yours and withdraw from the process instead of letting the decision be made for you.

As a result, they disregard any additional information, such as certifications they have in their field, that would enhance their qualifications and assure that they stand out from the competition.                                     5:  English Spelling Rules: Adding Prefixes and Suffixes                    Knowing proper spelling is very important for a number of reasons. First of all, when words cannot be spoken from our mouths we can write them down. If these words are not spelled properly, then that communication is compromised.

It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. In accounting, ownership is described by the term ""equity,"" (see the related term  shareholders' equity ). Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equations are the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are usually listed on the  balance sheet . It has a  normal balance , or usual balance, of  debit  (i.e., asset account amounts appear on the left side of a  ledger ).   Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  cash ,  equipment  and  real estate .

A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plan, is a retirement plan for certain employees of public schools, employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and certain ministers. Individual accounts in a 403(b) plan can be any of the following types: - An annuity contract, which is provided through an insurance company. - A custodial account, which is invested in mutual funds. - A retirement income account set up for church employees. Generally, retirement income accounts can invest in either annuities or mutual funds.

(Hi, Dad!)  Our conversations got me to thinking about retirement account limits for 2008.  My wife makes mandatory contributions to a pension plan, I have a 403b account, and we both have Roth IRAs.  We are both in our 30’s.  I do not receive any ‘matching’ contributions from my employer.  We have a modified AGI of less than 150K.  For more information about  403b contribution limits, refer to IRS Publication 571 .  For more information about  IRA contribution limits, refer to IRS Publication 590 .  (By the way, I know very, very little about taxes or retirement accounts.  Please, do your own research and consult a qualified financial professional before making any financial decisions, especially decisions about taxes and retirement accounts.  I’m simply writing a  post about what I’m doing and I am in NO WAY suggesting that you should do as I do.  Seriously, I don’t even trust myself with a credit card, so what do I know? :))  After doing a little research, the actual limit for 403b contributions for 2008 is a little difficult to figure out.  Most sources report the 2007 limit of $15,500 but then suggest that the limit, starting in 2008, will go up by $500 per year.   So, for 2008, my retirement account contribution goals will be (based on assumed contribution limits):       2008   Under 50   Over 50       403b   $15,500   Up To $20,500       Roth IRA   $5,000   Up To $6000       I included the “Over 50″ numbers for my Dad!  So, in 2008, my goal will be to put $25,500 into our retirement accounts.  By the way, if you are wondering if you should focus on your 403b (or 401K) or a Roth IRA,  may I suggest that you read this excellent article over at Consumerism Commentary ?  Flexo does a great job of addressing the 401K/Roth IRA question!   Side note:  I was very happy to learn that the contribution limits are based on how much the employee contributes.  If your company ‘matches’ a portion of your contribution, that ‘match’ does not count against your contribution limit!  Also, the 403b limit is based on the assumption that the limit will go up by $500, based on cost-of-living increase.  The limit for 2007 is $15,500,  and many sources indicate that the limit for 2008 will be $16,000 .   (Edit: It looks like the 403b contribution limit will remain unchanged for 2008. It will be $15,500)                        Filed under:  Retirement    Share:  add to tip'd   -   digg this   -   stumble it   -   save to del.icio.us                  14 Responses               Rxforfinance    June 21st, 2007 at 11:47 pm    1         I believe the minimum adjustment for 2008 (and consecutive years) will be $500, but it is based on some gage of inflation or cost of living.  The IRS will give figures later this year.                     Mia    June 23rd, 2007 at 5:47 pm    2         Just an FYI - some companies set their own contribution limits.  We have a 401k and our company only allows for a max 15% employee contribution.  Unfortunately, we can’t reach the 2007 IRS limit  (same as 403b) without contributing more than 20%.  It’s still a pretty good plan though (100% match up to 6% plus an additional 4% company contribution).   The Consumerism article you link to advises to fund your 401k or 403b up to your employer match and then to fully fund your IRA’s.  But the author loses me when he states to then fund the 401k (to the max, I assume - another 9% in my case) “if your company offers you low-cost options”.  Anyone know what he means by “low-cost options”?  Isn’t investing with pre-tax dollars about as low as you can get?                     NCN    June 23rd, 2007 at 6:12 pm    3         Mia… You are correct, your employer can limit the amount you can contribute… fortunately for me, my employer allows me to setup my salary in any way that I wish and places no such limits… As for low-cost options… several 401K plans and 403B plans charge large management fees, and should be avoided…  NCN                     Mia    June 24th, 2007 at 9:30 am    4         Ah, thanks NCN.  We aren’t charged any fees so I guess we’re in the clear on that.  We are working on fully funding both of our IRA’s this year, and I’m curious about our next retirement funding step - fully funding the 401k, etc.  I appreciate reading about the steps you’ve decided to take.

Are the Roth IRA limits simply doubled for a married couple?

Non-profit employees may contribute both to a 403(b) and a 457 and the limits are the same, except that the tax code is structured such that you can contribute the maximum to both plans.  In other words, you can put 16k into the 403(b) as well as up to 16k into the 457.  Very few public sector employees are aware of this powerful option to defer taxes.                     Anonymous    July 10th, 2007 at 5:37 pm    11         In response to Mia, it is incredibly unlikely you are not getting charged any fees — you may not be getting charged account maintenance fees but more likely in the form of fund management fees. Some retirement plans have funds which charge over 1% for “fund management” which is pretty outrageous in today’s investment marketplace where index funds with fees lower than .25% are common. However, some plans make it hard for you to find out the management fees; you may have to ask your plan administrator for a prospectus.

The maximum contribution amount for 2007 is $15,500. In January, I elected to have $1000 per month contributed to my 403b, but in mid-June I decided that I needed to adjust my contributions. So, my monthly paychecks for July - December will be $583.33 less. ($3500 / 6 months = $583.33)   This additional contribution of $3500 should save me $875+ in income taxes for 2007. (I’m in the 25% tax bracket.) So, by maxing out my contribution for 2007, my total tax savings should be approximately $3825. ($15,500 * 25% = $3825)   I’ve already managed to fully-fund my Roth IRA for 2007 and I’m working on my fully-funding my wife’s Roth IRA. By fully-funding multiple types of retirement account, I can diversify my investments AND my tax risks. The 403b will grow “tax-deferred”and the Roth IRAs will grow “tax-free”.   I’m working  very, very hard to save $48,000 in various retirement and savings  accounts. This adjustment was partially “planned-for”. In other words, when I created my $48000 goal, I had hopes that I could adjust my paycheck and fully-fund my 403b. So, this adjustment keeps me on track to meet my goal.

clueweb09-enwp03-10-22423	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Tangible asset )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ clarification needed ] [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are  goodwill ,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds  and  stocks .           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities +Capital (Owners' Equity)     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets   Main article:  Current asset   Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets   Main article:  Fixed asset   Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets   Main article:  Intangible asset   Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.

If your report says you don't pay your bills on time, or that you have a lot of debt, you may not get that loan -- or you may get it but have to pay a higher interest rate. Because it can have such an impact on the things you do in your life, you should make sure that your credit report is accurate and that you understand how it affects the credit you can get.   In this article, we'll take a look at what goes into a credit report, who puts it there, and who can get access to it. We'll also find out how all of that information is compiled into a single document that can have a pretty big impact on your life.   A credit report is an accumulation of information about how you pay your bills and repay loans, how much credit you have available, what your monthly debts are, and other types of information that can help a potential lender decide whether you are a good credit risk or a bad credit risk.        Debt Image Gallery   Not monitoring your credit report can lead to excessive debt and additional fees. See more  debt pictures .          The report itself does not say whether you are a good or bad credit risk -- it provides lenders with the data to make the decision themselves.  Credit bureaus , also known as credit reporting agencies (CRAs), collect this information from merchants, lenders, landlords, etc., and then sell the report to businesses so they can evaluate your application for credit. Lenders make their decisions based on different criteria, so having all of the information helps them ensure that they are making the right decision.

The point of the article was that consumers should be aware that while unions generally exist to help their members, they also need money to survive.  The donations they receive may encourage them to endorse an investment or insurance product which isnt the vehicle best suited for performance, or the best deal in terms of cost and expenses.  If somebody is pushing for their product to be sold, its most likely not the best product because really good deals seem to publicize themselves.                                                                                           I believe the ING Opportunity Plus 403b plan is truly not in the best interests of most of the hundreds of thousands of people invested in it.  The only reason this plan can fly with school districts in the first place is that 403b plans are funded primarily by employees in the plan.  The school doesnt match your contribution the way a 401k plan might.  This lets the school off the hook in terms of all responsibilities besides the fiduciary duties involved with administering the plan.  Further, it allows ING to make out like bandits by playing the roll of advocate rather than salesman.  They should just come right out and explain that they are as profit-motivated as the next guy.  They certainly demonstrate this by locking teachers up into variable annuity sub-accounts which are expensive and have complicated withdrawal fees.      I should point out that I like to give people the benefit of the doubt- I even tried to do this with ING by researching the Opportunity Plus program on INGs website to see if maybe I was missing something.  I wasnt and I will continue to speak to teachers in the New York area about this since ING does not provide what I consider to be adequate disclosure about many aspects of their product.  This morning I had my worst experience with ING to date.  I called up the Opportunity Plus service center- the place where you direct questions about your investments and can make changes such as switching from one fund to another.  I called because a client of mine wants to switch her assets out of the plan and into another product.  I wanted to make sure she wouldnt get hit with any withdrawal penalties for making this change.  Naturally, they arent going to give me information about a clients account that isnt on the telephone with me.  However, consumers have the right to ask generic questions about a product and get a generic answer.  The representative on the telephone wouldnt answer my generic questions about deferred sales charges on the Opportunity Plus product.  I wasnt unfriendly or unreasonable, but I think she started to feel uncomfortable.  She hung up the telephone abruptly when I started to push a bit more about these hidden fees.  Never in my five years advising on 403b investments have I been hung up on by a customer service line.  Not a good idea for ING considering they are involved with an investigation by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for their too-friendly relationship with the teachers union.    I will continue giving seminars on proper ways to handle 403b investments in the future.  Its my hope to shed some light on complicated issues which are slowly draining retirement assets from people who cant afford to be doing so.  This is no secret to Congress and they are actively trying to reform situations like this from continuing in the future.  If you or somebody you know works for an organization that has a 403b program, please encourage them to do research on what they are investing in and speak to a trusted advisor about how to maximize these benefits.

Budgeting is an exercise that can help a person relieve financial stress by keeping track of income and expenses instead of falling into the abyss of debt.  Budgeting software  helps an individual spend his or her money wisely.  Budgeting worksheets  are an integral part of the budgeting process. They help in allocating money into various categories and also help in augmenting savings. Let us try and analyze the advantages of using budgeting worksheets even for planning travel and weddings. We take a look at  zero-based budgeting  and how it works.       Budgeting worksheets    A budgeting worksheet helps you understand your income and expenses. Listing out your expenses, fixed and variable is the first step towards prudent budgeting. Maintaining budgeting worksheets over a period of time will help you understand how much money you earn and spend. Budgeting worksheets are available aplenty on online financial management web sites. Some of them can be downloaded for free. You can make use of these printable budget worksheets to balance your finances. Though some people prefer to create their budgets on paper, electronic budgeting worksheets or budgeting software can help you in decision making too. You can make 'What if' projections using interactive budgeting software and even print them out to maintain records.    When planning your next travel getaway, you can utilize specialized budgeting software and financial worksheets to estimate your projected expenses. A travel budget needs to account for passports, visas, wardrobe and personal items, transportation costs and accommodation expenses. When estimating your travel expenses for budgeting, don't forget to add costs of activities such as golf and riding. You need to plan for your meals and entertainment expenditure too. A wedding budgeting worksheet is yet another handy budgeting software that helps you to plan for your special day. Wedding budgeting software makes provisions for the ceremony expenses such as the location rentals, music, food, cake, favors, decoration and photography. You have to estimate the expenditure on your attire and jewelry.      Personal budgeting software    Personal budgeting software can be used to gain control over your current finances. But more importantly, such software for personal budgeting can go a long way in a sustained effort to build personal wealth. The advantages of utilizing personal budgeting software and keeping track of your finances are many:     You become aware of the impact of every spending decision.    Budgeting software packages are designed to help you take control of financial situations for different timeframes.    You become aware of your overspending habits. It becomes easier to track and estimate your spending patterns.    You can effectively manage your debt, be it credit card debt or mortgage repayments.    Use of budgeting software brings to light areas where you can reduce expenses and control spending.       Zero based budgeting  Zero-based budgeting involves creating a financial program ground up each financial year. This method of budgeting involves justifying all expenditure for each new period. This is contrary to the policy of only explaining expenditures that are in excess of the previous year's expenditure. Zero-based budgeting is successfully followed by many organizations and is used for governmental planning and budgeting of funds. Zero-based budgeting ensures need-based and efficient allocation of resources. This type of budgeting pattern necessitates implementation of cost effective methods of operations and detects inflated budgets. But zero-based budgeting restrains decision-making on account of the necessity to account for every detail of expenditure. Unless the managers are sufficiently trained, zero-based budgeting cannot be enforced effectively in any organization.         Portal for Woman  - A treasure trove of information on women ...

Now that carefully crafted reputation is under assault, thanks to a messy legal dispute with a group called the Starbucks Workers Union (SWU) (part of the Industrial Workers of the World, or IWW), which started recruiting employees in 2004 and now claims 300 members.     The National Labor Relations Board found on Dec. 23 that  Starbucks  had illegally fired three New York City baristas as it tried to squelch the union organizing effort. The 88-page ruling also says the company broke the law by giving negative job evaluations to other union supporters and prohibiting employees from discussing union issues at work. The judge ordered that the three baristas be reinstated and receive back wages. The judge also called on Starbucks to end discriminatory treatment of other  pro-union  workers at four Manhattan locations named in the case. The decision marks the end of an 18-month trial in New York City that pitted the ubiquitous multinational corporation against  a group of twentysomething baristas  who are part of the Industrial Workers of the World.     The timing isn't ideal for Starbucks, which faces lower demand from the recession, an overall loss of panache for the brand, and a sliding stock price. ""[The ruling] is a real thumb in the eye—a real gotcha moment with potential for heartache,"" says Eric Dezenhall, chief executive officer of Dezenhall Resources, a crisis management public relations firm in Washington D.C. ""I don't think it's a crisis, but it hovers between [being] a nuisance and a problem.""    eyeing 401(k) contributions    Starbucks intends to appeal the decision. The company maintained during the trial that the baristas were fired for perfectly legal reasons, such as disrupting business in its stores or threatening a manager. ""This is an issue with particular employees,"" says Tara Darrow, a Starbucks spokeswoman. ""We felt we handled it consistently and fairly. In this particular situation the NLRB disagreed. We're disappointed with that.""     The ruling comes at a time when Starbucks is trying to get its groove back in a very grim economy. The company's shares more than halved in value in 2008, now trading just above $9, while  Dunkin Donuts  and McDonald's ( MCD ) continued to grab market share among coffee drinkers. As the recession deepens, Starbucks recently said it may end or trim contributions to workers' 401(k) accounts in 2009.     While the New York case marks the first that has gone to trial, Starbucks has been the target of numerous National Labor Relations Board complaints over unlawful violations of workers' rights. Starbucks settled another case in New York concerning illegal firings for union activity without admitting guilt in March 2006, paying $2,000 to former employees and offering their jobs back. In early October 2008, Starbucks settled the case of barista Erik Forman, who was fired for talking with co-workers about managers' apparent efforts to fire him for union organizing at a Minneapolis location. Starbucks ultimately invited Forman back to work. A similar case is getting under way in Grand Rapids, Mich.; the trial is expected to begin Jan. 7.

Are you approaching retirement age and wondering what you’ll do if you can no longer care for yourself or your spouse in the future? Maybe you have a parent that is starting to lose their mental faculties or might need someone to care for them soon.    There are over 77 million people in the United States classified as baby boomers that are just now turning sixty and are considering if retirement is an option. They make up 27.5% of the population. While many people don’t like to discuss the possibilities of what could happen in the future, it is something that needs to be discussed and planned for. Depending on what happens and what the person’s needs are, there are nursing homes, assisted living facilities, adult day care and at home assistance. These all have varying price tags associated with them, but the underlying reality is that none of them are cheap. Let's face it: Good care is expensive. Today, a nursing home can range from $150 to $300 a day - that’s an average of $70,000 or more per year. That is higher than many husbands and wives salaries...combined!    We do know one thing... health care prices will continue to rise, especially since the industry is expecting so many more clients with the baby-boomer generation transitioning into this stage of their life. That is why long-term care insurance has become so important and a significant component of the revenues for the insurance industry.    Remember, while you may not be in the age range to need the coverage just yet, there maybe someone older who will soon need to rely on you for care.    Long-term care insurance is coverage which provides the funds to cover the costs of assistance. Just as we have seen with other forms of insurance, the can be several different policy structures and varying ways to pay for it. There is an old African Proverb that says: “For tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today."" So, even if you don’t think you’ll ever need long term care or insurance to cover it, you might want to at least look into it because the future has a strange way of being, well uncertain...    Traditional long-term care insurance policies require one to pay a monthly premium which will pay for long term care should it ever be needed. Depending on your age and benefits of the plan, these are not cheap and can cost anywhere from $2,500 to $5,000 per year. To be honest, that is a lot of money to throw away on a plan that you “might use” or might not. This just seems like a hard pill to swallow. The good news is that there are plans that provide an alternative in case you don’t use the policy. Basically it combines some of the benefits of long term care insurance with a savings plan.    Since this is a relatively newer side to the industry, not every agent may have this in their product mix. But this newer Long Term Care insurance product design is getting a good deal of attention. It’s a policy that allows you to combine the features of life insurance and long term care into one. The main difference is that the premiums are all paid in one lump sum in order to provide the long term care protection and the component that provides for a refund of unused premium.    The process of obtaining this type of policy is fairly simple. You fill out an application, pay the one time premium which earns interest and can be used to cover future nursing expenses if needed.    Let’s look at an example. A person invests $70,000 into a long-term care policy. They have the added feature of a $70,000 money back guarantee if they choose to withdrawal/cancel their policy under certain conditions. Then, there the life insurance component that amounts to $118,073 in tax free payment for the beneficiary if the insured dies and $236,146 for the payment of long-term care benefit, as per the policy. The real benefit is that there is a feeling of relief knowing that you, or your loved one. will be taken care of - no matter what your health in the future and your family won’t have the burden of the expenses. The last thing I would want is to be burden on my family or put undo or stress on them.    Now, with so many different policy options out there how are you supposed to know if this is a good plan option or not? Here are some tips for navigating the insurance policy jungle. One thing you need to realize when dealing with the future is that it’s difficult to define your long term care need since it is unknown. Private insurance is expensive so be prepared, this market is continually changing and thus will have uncertainties to it. Remember to look at the policy details as there is the possibility for changes in the future as far as premiums and the potential benefits. Look to lock in everything that's possible.    Look for inflation protection. This may seem expensive when looking at the initial premium cost but may be less expensive than a five to ten percent increase over the next few years. Prices for assisted living and nursing homes vary across the country so look into prices in your area before selecting a plan. There are no guaranteed premium policies so be aware. Make sure the policy you consider covers assisted living, in-home care and nursing home care. Some policies will seem to cover all of these but by reading the fine print, you’ll find that they have stipulations.    It may seem confusing and exhausting but you can make your way through the insurance maze and out alive. Remember, you’re protecting yourself and your family for the future.

U are a great writer i must say. Thanks a lot for these worthy infos. Being a financial expert i would like to add some points on your article. Human life is subject to risks of death and disability due to natural and accidental causes. When human life is lost or a person is disabled permanently or temporarily, there is a loss of income to the household. The family is put to hardship. An individual can protect himself or herself against such contingencies through  long term care insurance . Every family has its own needs and prerequisites that are to be met prior to the purchase of the policy. Among the many policies that exist, the term life insurance is the most preferred by many and is quite in demand nowadays.

I would consider a LTC above age 50. Different situations require different planning, but that is a god rule of thumb  Andrew                                                                                                                                                                    Samir                                     Says:                                                                                7/18/2008 7:10:24 PM                                                                                                         Good podcast. I just wish he had mentioned at what age we should consider buying it. I am 32. Do I need to look into it this now, or at what age?

I sent them to Insure Your Future (www.disabilityinsuranceadvisor.com) online and they called an agent who put together several policy options from different companies.  The each ended up with $135/day coverage that increased annually based on inflation.  Now their comfortable their nest egg won't be burned through later in life.

At the end of a year, your principal will never go down.”   I know there’s no free lunch in this world. But I also know that the way to make money is to limit your downside risk (to prevent a “catastrophic” loss), and leave your upside potential as unlimited as possible.   In the investment Jeff was telling me about - called  equity indexed annuities   - limiting your downside risk and giving your upside unlimited potential are both possible. Here’s a little more from our talk   Jeff :  “Steve, look at it this way If you invest $100,000 in the first year, and the market falls by 20%, the value of your investment will be $100,000. And in the second year, if the market goes up by 20%, then your investment will be worth $120,000.”   I find that a ridiculously good offer your portfolio never has to recover from a fall. No downside, and all the upside, that doesn’t seem right How can it be possible?   Jeff :  “Well, you get  almost  all of the upside of the stock market In the equity indexed annuities investment I’m talking about, you’re capped to a 2.7% gain in the stock market in any one month. Let me give an extreme example If the market is flat for 11 months, and then goes up 12% in December, then you’re only credited for 2.7% for the year. As another extreme example, if the market is up 2% every month for the whole year, than you never bumped into the cap and get to keep all those gains.”   So, how have equity indexed annuities actually performed?   Jeff :  “Some specific history here might be helpful This indexed annuity investment returned over 17% last year. And, as of the beginning of the year, $100,000 invested at the beginning of 1999 was worth over $135,000, while the S&P 500 was still well under water. Also, all these gains are tax-deferred, similar to an IRA.”   So these things are called equity indexed annuities, huh? I don’t know a lot about annuities. But I used to hear that fees were high. What’s the story with annuities?   Jeff :  “There is generally a ’surrender charge’ that usually declines every year and eventually disappears in seven years’ time, in the equity indexed annuity I’ve been recommending. If you can hold for seven years, then you will have gotten most of the upside and none of the downside of the stock market, with the only ‘cost’ being the fact that your upside was limited to 2.7% in any month. That’s a fair trade-off to me. For the full story, you might want to check out Jack Marrion’s website”   I did.  Jack Marrion  is the industry watchdog. Jack runs a site called  http://www.indexannuity.org . Here are a few recent points from Jack:     In the last year, equity indexed annuities have delivered 3 to 8 times the return of CDs (though Jeff says that the last year was particularly favorable to indexed annuities, and should not be considered a regular occurrence)   No equity indexed annuity owner has ever lost a dime due to market downturn.   No indexed annuity owner has ever lost a dime because a carrier failed.   Unlike bonds, indexed annuities don’t lose value when interest rates rise.   An equity indexed annuity lets you take advantage of market drops.     So what’s the REAL risk? Jack Marrion says:  “The biggest risk an index annuity owner faces is that they might have earned a higher return in another vehicle (but then again, hindsight’s always 20-20).”   The idea with equity indexed annuities is that, over time, they’d beat your fixed investments like CDs  and bonds, but may underperform the stock market. It’s quite possible that these equity  index annuities could beat both fixed investments and the stock market over the next few years . And they would do so with less risk - as neither stocks nor bonds guarantee that you’ll make money.   Understanding Equity Indexed Annuities:  Three Steps to Get You Started    Indexed annuities are not right for everyone. But if you’re over 50, and not particularly optimistic about the stock market these may be something of interest to you. If the idea of guaranteed minimum returns with a stock-like upside is interesting to you, I recommend you do three things:     Š    Spend a good amount of time on  Jack Marrion’s  website:  http://www.indexannuity.org , where equity indexed annuities are explained inside and out with both a beginner and expert investor perspective.   Read the basics of indexed annuities from an industry regulator, such as this very good Illinois web site example:  http://www.ins.state.il.us/Life_Annuities/equityindex.htm  Once you’ve done that, to determine which indexed annuity might be appropriate for you, then   Contact my recommended financial planner Jeff Winn of International Assets in Orlando, FL, at 800.432.4402, or e-mail jwinn@iaac.com. I’ve known Jeff for many years. We were college roommates, and groomsmen in each other’s weddings. Jeff will take good care of you. He can answer your questions and meet your financial planning needs.         Lastly, be aware that I don’t consider myself any kind of expert in this area, and I don’t own nor have never bought an equity indexed annuity (but I’m not in my 50s yet). Please make sure you do plenty of your own homework to determine if this is right for you                                                                    Today’s IU Cribsheet     There’s a reason to act now with equity indexed annuities Jeff Winn says there’s an extraordinary, free long-term care benefit included in the indexed annuity he’s recommending that will be taken away forever in 2005. It’s a disability rider that will boost income payments by as much as 60% in the event of a disability, for the rest of the owner’s life. So you get no downside and nearly all the upside of the stock market, with a long-term care benefit too. That sounds worth learning more about Again, contact Jeff Winn of International Assets in Orlando, FL, at 800.432.4402, or e-mail  jwinn@iaac.com .

Meanwhile, the overlooked White Cap Index rocketed in the exact opposite direction. In fact, White Cap stocks climbed an average of 135% straight through the credit-crunch.    One stock recently added to the index - an overlooked Massachusetts-based solar company - even doubled from November 18 to December 11.   Before March 2nd, another five White Caps - including a medical pioneer dubbed the greatest innovator of 2008 by the Cleveland Clinic - will be added to the index... with potential to soar 309% or higher.

I’m contributing the max to my ’standard’ defined contribution retirement plan (5% of my salary). When combined with the matching funds (a bit over 8% of my salary), I’m stashing a little better than 13% of my annual salary in that account. On top of that, my wife and I have both been  maxing out our Roth IRAs  (we do this  every   year ). So what’s the point of the optional 403(b)?      Well, we can afford more than the 5% + $8k that we’re currently saving, and the 403(b) let’s us do it in a tax-deferred fashion. Moreover, my employer’s 403(b) is pretty flexible in terms of vendors. In fact, we can even use Vanguard, which is unavailable to us through the standard defined contribution plan (we’re using Fidelity). For now, we’re pouring eveything into the  Vanguard Target Retirement 2035 Fund  which provides us with instant diversification at a low cost.   The only thing that I’m not crazy about is the fact that Vanguard charges an annual administrative fee of $15/year for 403(b) accounts. This fee is in place for all customers with  less than $250k  in total assets at Vanguard (this is where their so-called ‘Voyager’ service kicks in).   Right now, our only other retirement savings option is  my SEP-IRA . Since we’re maxing out our Roth IRAs, we can’t make any ’standard’ employye contributions to that account (Roth, Traditional, and SEP contributions all count toward the same limit). However, I’ll be able to make 2006  employer  contributions to that account on my own behalf (which I plan on doing). The limit here is 25% of my  net  self-employment income (which is a good bit less than 25% of my  gross  self-employment income).

Why wouldn’t you save the maximum?  Is it because you have other goals?           Comment by LivingAlmostLarge — Dec 27th 2006 @  3:00 pm                                                   We’ll see. We’re already saving for retirement through another employer plan, two Roth IRAs and a SEP-IRA. We also have four kids and one income. While our income is way up relative to a year ago, I’m still not sure if we’ll be able to knock out the whole $15.5k this year. We’ll certainly try, though.

Did you happen to catch Laura Rowley’s column about regret when it comes to money? Do you feel like you are depriving yourself too much to meet these goals?

clueweb09-enwp00-28-18540	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Business asset )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are goodwill,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds ,  stocks  and  cash .           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

This schizophrenic experience has also made me realize what an insurmountable gulf a mere ½ km can be … Foundations of Prosperity  One way I can make sense out of this is to visualize that we live in two India(s) – these two realities coexist side-by-side in a surrealistic blend:  This posting is an attempt to understand these two India(s). One may say that this is a sort of anthropological exploration of two continents/ paradigms/ realities – which co-exist, and yet do not (perhaps) understand the other side The Visible India: The  Visible India  is visible because it is the proverbial tip-of-the-iceberg. It is also the convenient constituency of media, and therefore plays an influential part of metropolitan debates and conversation, and in forming perceptions about India. Only about 15% of India’s 190mn households have an annual household income of more than Rs 2.5 lacs (Rs 0.2.5mn). Assuming 5 persons / household, these approx. 150mn people (out of 1bn) are the solid citizens of  Visible India . There must be another 100mn or so who also exist on the periphery of this demographic continent (or believe that they do) Citizens of the  Visible India  share two common features: 1. irrespective of their income-levels, they like to describe themselves as the “middle-class”. They also believe that the “middle class” is a synonym for the “common man” or the representative citizen of India. 2. they see consumption as an inalienable right, and like to describe themselves as “consumers” or “customers”… In the  Visible India , there is no such term like a Middle-Class Producer.  The consumption of the  Visible India  contributes substantially to India’s GDP. For instance, during 2004, its inhabitants downloaded ring-tone worth Rs. 400 crores (Rs. 4bn) on their mobile/cell phones, and they contributed an estimated Rs. 1500 crores (i.e., Rs.15bn) to GDP during Valentine Day, and so on… The  Visible India  likes numbers, and believes in their magical quality in capturing the reality. Numbers like “GDP”, “FDI”, “Global Competitiveness Index”, “Profits”, “Market Share”, etc. are important to them; their personal self-esteem goes up and down with these numbers. One of the magical numbers, for instance, which its inhabitants like is “Sensex” – it is seen as an indicator of the health of Indian economy/business. Its “magical” quality lies in the fact that it is based on the behaviour of about 35-40mn investor population (about 0.4% of India’s total population), as they buy and sell the “dead stocks” of a handful (30-50) of India’s companies. The inhabitants of the  Visible India  also like words such as “privatization”, “globalizations”, “competitiveness”, etc., which they see as signs of progress and development.  Correspondingly, by and large, they feel that nation-states and government have (or should have) less role to play in “economic” development. The also feel that nations are economies and not societies. Quite a few of those living in the  Visible India  – hopefully, not all – are also skeptical about “democracy” in India. Some, in fact, also feel that “we have too much democracy” and prefer not to participate in it. Nevertheless, they do expect an elected government to provide them with “world-class infrastructure”, take care of the “consumers’ interests”, reduce taxes, abolish regulations, etc….  all in the same breath!!!  – more often than not, they also succeed!!! Citizen of the  Visible India  like to live on debts – credit cards, consumer finance schemes, loans, etc. – the higher the debt, the greater one’s “credit worthiness”. Lastly – actually, not lastly – one can go on elaborating - , the  Visible India  holds a premium on the “brands” that one buys, the “address” one lives in, the “life-style” on leads, the “CV-value” of one’s activities, etc. Etc. etc…… The Invisible India: The  Invisible India  is invisible because it is so ubiquitous and pervasive - it gets merged in the background of the hectic lives of those who live on the other side of reality. It remains a taken-for-granted, nondescript, an apparently needless distraction, except for those who live in it. About 92-93% of India’s active workforce lives in this reality…  Actually, they  live  in slums, shanties, and villages.  The economists say that they belong to the “informal”/ “unorganized”/ “marginal” sector… which actually is funny, since this “informal” sector accounts for around 2/3rd of the workforce even in all metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, etc.)… but then most economists live in the Visible India… These denizens of the  Invisible India  follow diverse professions – hawkers, vendors, roadside tailors, mechanics, contract labours, construction and agricultural workers,  domestic workers, weavers, potters, papad-rollers, handcart pullers, laundry workers, etc.  … and account for 60% of India’s GDP! In a way, they are India’s truly self-employed privatized citizens – no government support, no income or social security, no access to formal credits, no insurance… Most of the workers in India’s 3.2mn SMEs – that accounts for India’s 40% of manufacturing sector and 36% of exports – are also a part of the  Invisible India  (in 2003, when the India’s pharma company, Ranbaxy Ltd. registered $960 in its overseas sales, Dharavi – Asia’s largest slum in India’s financial capital, Mumbai – exported goods worth an estimated between $690 and $1.84bn). The  Invisible India  also accounts for the bottom 10% of India’s population which owns 1% of country’s assets (as compared to the top 10% in the Visible India who own 48%). Of the India’s 0.7mn villages, around 67% have a population of less than 1000 – mostly with no roads, no electricity, no amenities of sorts, etc.… They are also a part of the  Invisible India . It is somewhat ironic - The  Invisible India  is also a low cost, cheap supply of labour and services, and subsidizes the “life-style” costs of the Visible India… in terms of a maid-servant, a dhobi, a guy who delivers milk/newspaper… etc. ...Just a thought which keeps recurring in my mind:  Are we a Schzoid Nation?          Posted by  The Theme      at  Monday, October 03, 2005                                          Labels:  Inequality ,  Poverty                  5 comments:                   Anshul  said...      Very insightful post. If the people of visible India would only spare a thought for the invisible Indians, society in India as a whole might be a whole lot better, because a lot of India's problems are actually common across the two spheres - corruption and lack of infrastructure for example. Its just that the ""middle class"" believes it can throw money and fix the problem where it really should demand a nationwide solution from the government.          11:57 PM                      Ajit Chouhan  said...      First let me thank you Professor for highlighting this chasm which exists much to the comfort of the so called middle class, politicians, as well as the media. The globalisation fad has lead to marketisation of news and views.They write for those who read and consume news.........so you'll find media more interested in Karishma Kapoor's marital life and Saurav Gangulay's shenanigans. The fact that the divide is increasing and people's awareness about this divide is abysmal makes things worse. Infact Bihar Jhakhand UP Orissa and MP which constitues sizable portion of the population has the worst division. Do keep writing such ,you are an inspiration for our generation. Regards          11:56 AM                      Suresh Vattenad  said...      Very well highlighted. I believe as time goes by, enterprising people will find their way up. Is it not true that Wealth has to trickle to grow? Is it not true that pressure from society will change government policies? These changes cannot happen overnight. People in this unorganized sector must push hard for the changes, and for this to happen should realize what their rights are. There will be villans who will pose as leaders and mislead the less aware but it is upto the public to realize what they want. People like you are the hope for educating the masses....Please do write on what you think should be done to reduce the gap...I hope someday soon, we have a more homogenious society.          6:37 AM                      dreamer  said...      I saw something similar when I wsa doing summers in Bangalore. I had enough money to splurge fr the first time ans for a change I did it really obscenely. However even when I would be fully ""spirited"" the stark contrast in terms of forum and the huts on the road side near IIMB never disappeared from my sight. One of my friends commented, ""These huts will be gone forever very soon. This area is becoming posh and the land has become really costly."" Then he said smilingly, ""Perhaps this place can't afford them to allow them to live""          8:27 PM                      tanmay  said...      don't know what to say i got the chance of my lifetime when i was peddling mundane goods(fmcg) in some of the poorest places of Orissa (kalahandi,malkangiri etc...)which is incidentally where my ancestors come from. FMCG companies all derive some part of their strength from that invisible india which provides them with the poorly paid salesmen(Rs 1500-2000) for distributors. They are the holders of the vital last mile yet not important enough to be on company rolls. But 2 things make me happy 1. When a distibutor in one of theese poor districts says it is becoming difficult find salesman and complains about rising wage costs. 2.When i hear and see stories of similar salesmen in metros earning far higher sums (8000-10000)          11:33 AM                      Post a Comment                                   Newer Post       Older Post     Home          Subscribe to:  Post Comments (Atom)               About this Blog     Alternative Perspective  started in Sept '02 (as a Newsletter), as an attempt to widen our awareness about issues related to business, environment, role and influence of media, geo-politics, culture, etc. It aims to share, on a regular basis, some of those pieces of news and information, which do not find place in the  highly monopolised mainstream media .

clueweb09-enwp03-22-06593	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Total Assets )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ clarification needed ] [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are  goodwill ,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds  and  stocks .           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities +Capital (Owners' Equity)     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets   Main article:  Current asset   Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets   Main article:  Fixed asset   Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets   Main article:  Intangible asset   Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

From  Hannah Rasmussen , for About.com    See More About: insider trading martha stewart sec violations               Martha Stewart has been in the news for several months because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission believes that Martha Stewart was told by her friend Sam Waksal that his company ImClone’s cancer drug had been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration before this information was made public. This rejection was a huge blow to his company and the price of its stock went down dramatically. However, Martha Stewart wasn’t financially hurt because she had her broker sell her 4000 shares before this news was made public. If this is true, and it should be noted it hasn’t been proven yet, then Martha Stewart is guilty of insider trading.    What Is Insider Trading?   When most people hear the term “insider trading” they think of the illegal version. However, the term “insider trading” can also mean the perfectly legal buying and selling of stock by a company’s corporate insiders. Insider trading is legal when these corporate insiders trade stock of their own company and report these trades to the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC). That way the insider trading is not kept a secret and anyone can find out a corporate insider’s opinion of his or her company.   Insider trading is only illegal when a person bases their trade of stocks in a public company on information that the public does not know. It is illegal to trade your own stock in a company based on this information but it is also illegal to give someone that information, a tip, so they can trade their stock.    Why Is Insider Trading Illegal?   The SEC’s job is to make sure that all investors are making decisions based on the same information. Insider trading can be illegal because it destroys this level playing field.    Punishments and Rewards Associated With Insider Trading   According to the SEC website there are almost 500 civil enforcement actions each year against individuals and companies that break securities laws. Insider trading is one of the most common laws broken. The punishment for illegal insider trading depends on the situation. The person can be fined, banned from sitting on the executive or board of directors of a public company and even jailed.   The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States allows the Securities and Exchange Commission to give a person a reward “a bounty” to someone who gives the Commission information that results in a fine of insider trading.

(MSO), was indicted by a federal grand jury today on nine counts. She was charged with committing securities violations, conspiring to commit them, and obstructed justice, among other violations, according to  CBS MarketWatch.    Her stockbroker, former Merrill Lynch employee Peter Bacanovic, was also indicted on several counts, including obstruction of justice and perjury.

CFOs Now Risk Magnets Rolling Budgets, with a Twist ImClone CFO Named Chief Executive What You Don't Know about Sarbanes-Oxley Bear Market: 2002 Compensation Survey                    A report from  CNBC  say that sources close to the case contend that the indictment will prompt Stewart to step down as chairman and CEO of her eponymous company. But Stewart herself said in a videotaped message played at the company's annual shareholder meeting yesterday that she wouldn't resign, Reuters reported.    The Securities and Exchange Commission is also expected to file a civil complaint against Stewart.    Accused of profiting from an inside trading tip on ImClone Systems, Stewart's alleged $225,000 misdeed could seriously affect the health of her $295 million media empire.    At issue is Stewart's sale of ImClone stock in December 2001, right ahead of a public announcement by the Food and Drug Administration that the agency denied approval of one of the biopharmaceutical company's key products. Stewart maintains her innocence.    A company spokesperson noted that MSO executives and its board have been working on contingency plans regarding Stewart's fate and will take action when it is appropriate. Documents recently filed with the SEC say that MSO executives are finding it hard to quantify the negative ripple effects of the investigations. However, they do blame first-quarter business woes on the uncertainty surrounding the probes -- and the bad publicity generated by the alleged scandal.    In general, the executives say the Stewart investigations are partly responsible for a decline in circulation and prospects for the magazine group, a decrease in magazine advertising revenues and prospects, a ""softness"" in response rates for the catalog and Internet direct-sales businesses, and a slowdown in new business development and strategic partnerships.    More specifically, for the quarter ending March 31, 2003, total revenues at MSO slid by about 15 percent, to $58 million, from the $68 million it reported in the same period a year ago. Publishing revenues, which accounted for 62 percent of MSO revenues in 2002, dropped by $9 million during the first quarter, to $34 million. Ultimately, say company officials, they won't be able to predict the effects of the Stewart situation on MSO with any accuracy.    Whatever the legal outcome, MSO was forced to increase spending on corporate communications and legal fees at a time when revenues are sputtering.    Government prosecutors are still mulling whether to charge Stewart with obstructing an investigation or with the more serious insider-trading allegation, according to a report in  The Financial Times . Both carry prison sentences and can potentially lead to a ban on Stewart serving as an MSO director.    Survey: Sarbox 404 Increases Audit Fees by 35 Percent Public companies will likely spend 35 percent more on audit fees to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, according to a new survey by Financial Executives International (FEI). Estimates for how many extra man-hours the compliance efforts will eat up vary tremendously; ranging from 80 hours to 65,000 hours, depending on the size and complexity of the company, say survey authors.    FEI polled 83 of its members at public companies that averaged $3.3 billion in revenues. On average, the survey participants said they would spend more than 6,000 hours -- including time devoted to internal resources, external resources, and attestation -- and shell out $480,000 each for software and IT consulting to comply with Section 404.    Sarbox 404 requires companies to design, implement, document, and continuously monitor internal controls and financial reporting procedures.    U.K. Ponders Excessive Pay Problems When British shareholders protested the excessive compensation paid out to directors at underperforming GlaxoSmithKline and HSBC, the British government took note. As a result, Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt announced this week that her department is considering developing an official ""framework"" for shareholder complaints.    Hewitt admits that executive pay is the purview of companies and shareholders -- and that the government had ""no problems with big rewards for big success,"" according to a CBS MarketWatch. But she believes that ""shareholders are rightly concerned when directors leave failing companies and walk away with excessive payouts.""    Public comment on the framework idea is slated to end in September. American investors, also fed up with high pay in the context of for non-performance, will be watching the U.K. pay debate closely.

clueweb09-enwp01-38-16308	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Financial asset )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are goodwill,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds ,  stocks  and  cash ;           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

clueweb09-enwp00-48-22208	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Definiton of asset )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are goodwill,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds ,  stocks  and  cash .           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).      Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

Play video                                                NEW YORK (CNN/Money) -      These days a walk down the aisle can lead you to destination bankruptcy. From the invitations to the flowers to the food to the band to the honeymoon, the average wedding costs about $27,000 according to Richard Markel, President of the Association for Wedding Professionals International.              It's no wonder half of all couples exceed the budgets they set up for themselves, says Daniel Lagani, Publisher of the Fairchild Bridal Group.              If you're planning to tie the knot, but you don't want to get your budget tangled up, stay tuned. Today's five tips will help you cut wedding costs.    1. Get someone else to pay.           Not only are costs for weddings going through the roof, but you can't rely on Mom and Dad to foot the bill. For that reason, more and more wedding couples are hitting up friends and family for the costs of the photography, the DJ, even the flowers.            And if you're too shy to ask for nuptial money, ask for help paying for the honeymoon. While it sounds tacky, you can do it tactfully, particularly if you use the web to help.            Online registries are now allowing couples to be more creative with gifts they solicit says Rosie Amodio of The Knot. From the wedding to the honeymoon to the future home, there are plenty of ways your guests can chip in.            The Knot's ""create-a-gift"" program directs guests to gift checks, selected by the couple. Wells Fargo & Co. offers wedding accounts where friends and family can deposit money online.            Honeyluna.com is a honeymoon registry service that ""breaks down"" your honeymoon into specific items, activities and adventures that your guests can buy.    2. Get bidding.           Go to eBay for savings on designer wedding dresses. A Vera Wang wedding dress can cost over $15,000. But on eBay there are dresses you can bid on for as low as $80. Of course, you'll probably need to have alterations done, but the savings speak for themselves.    3. Eat Chinese.           Sick of beef, chicken or fish?  Choose Chinese: Asian-inspired menus are increasingly popular, according to The Knot. These dishes are usually less expensive because they have more vegetables than meat. Or enjoy ethnic food like Italian or Mexican. These cuisines are often cheaper than traditional fare and your guests will think you were creative.            And who could forget the cake? While a large three tiered cake is a part of the wedding tradition, you can still cut some corners on cost. Order a smaller tiered cake that costs about $10 dollars a slice on display, suggests The Knot, and order a separate sheet cake of the same flavor for about $4 dollars a slice to be served to your guests. You can even substitute some fake layers in your display cake that will bring the cost down even more.    4. Be flower-savvy.           The flowers can add so much to the decorations, so don't fret, you don't have to skimp on them.            Instead, save money by skimping on the traditional and going with more exotic stems. Even the little substitutions add up. Why not exchange Black Magic roses for more reasonably priced dahlias in your bouquet and table arrangements? You will save about $4 a stem according to The Knot. With a wedding party of five women and a guest list of 150 people, you've just saved $520.            Judith Rivers-Moore, author of ""Beautiful Weddings and Events"" suggests placing mirror rounds under flowers to expand their appearance on the table.            Markel suggests getting your flowers shipped in from overseas. Flowers from South America are usually cheaper. You may need to snip some thorns, but the savings can be about 20 percent. Check out  www.fiftyflowers.com  or  www.marisolblooms.com .            But you may not even need to look outside your own town. Events Management consultant Gretchen Strutzenberg says that local trade schools can be a great resource if you want to get a deal on flowers.  Students even sell products to customers for the experience of running a florist shop. Check with your local school district or community college and find out about these classes.    5. Get outta town.           Instead of the traditional wedding, take your closest family and friends with you to a far-flung location to witness your ""I Do's.""              Fairchild Publications says that couples who have destination weddings spend an average of 41 percent less on their reception than those who have the average wedding. How come? For one thing, fewer guests may be invited, and also many invitees might not be able to make it.            For those who can, wedding couples can arrange special discounts on airlines and hotels. American Airlines will give you 5 percent off the lowest fare they have available according to your travel plans if you have 10 or more guests traveling.            If you decide to fly Air Jamaica, the destination wedding package includes the honeymoon. For about $2,300 per couple, the package includes roundtrip airfare, the wedding service plus 5 nights at a hotel and daytime activities like horseback riding and glass-bottom boat tours.

clueweb09-enwp00-34-00825	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Assets )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are goodwill,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds ,  stocks  and  cash .           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

clueweb09-enwp00-20-00684	"                     Asset          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          This article is about the business definition.  For other uses, see  Asset (disambiguation) .   In  business  and  accounting ,  assets  are everything of value that is owned by a person or  company . It is a claim on the property your income of a borrower. [ 1 ]  The balance sheet of a firm records the monetary [ 2 ]  value of the assets owned by the firm. It is money and other valuables belonging to an individual or business.  [ 3 ] The two major asset classes are tangible assets and intangible assets. Tangible assets contain various subclasses, including current assets and fixed assets. [ 4 ]  Current assets include inventory, while fixed assets include such items as  buildings  and  equipment . [ 5 ]  Intangible assets are nonphysical resources and rights that have a value to the firm because they give the firm some kind of advantage in the market place. Examples of intangible assets are goodwill,  copyrights ,  trademarks ,  patents  and computer programs, [ 5 ]  and financial assets, including such items as  accounts receivable ,  bonds ,  stocks  and  cash ;           Contents       1   Asset characteristics     1.1   Current assets   1.2   Long-term investments   1.3   Fixed assets   1.4   Intangible assets   1.5   Tangible assets       2   See also   3   References               [ edit ]   Asset characteristics   Assets have three essential characteristics:     The probable future benefit involves a capacity, singly or in combination with other assets, in the case of profit oriented enterprises, to contribute directly or indirectly to future net  cash flows , and, in the case of  not-for-profit organizations , to provide services;   The entity can control access to the benefit;   The transaction or event giving rise to the entity's right to, or control of, the benefit has already occurred.     It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equation is the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are listed on the  balance sheet . Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  equipment  and  real estate .

There are different methods of assessing the monetary value of the assets recorded on the Balance Sheet. In some cases, the  Historical Cost  is used; such that the value of the asset when it was bought in the past is used as the monetary value. In other instances, the present  fair market value  of the asset is used to determine the value shown on the balance sheet.     ^   Sullivan, arthur ; Steven M. Sheffrin (2003).

Instead he wants to sell the lottery to a private company for a lump-sum payment.  From the  New York Times : The state of Illinois yesterday took the first steps in selling its state lottery system, hoping to attract as much as $10 billion from investors who, in return, would own a monopoly that could turn out to be the biggest jackpot yet.  Under the proposed sale, Illinois would receive a multibillion-dollar one-time payment, and the lottery's new owners would receive all revenue and profit for 75 years.  There are both positives and negatives to this plan. The potential downside: what will happen after the lump-sum payment is used up? Will legislators use it solely--and slowly--for education, or jump at the chance to fund pet projects, shuffling funds so they appear to be using the money for education? When the money runs out, will legislators simply create another source of state-run gambling revenue to fund education without raising property taxes--say,  slot machines, as in Pennsylvania ?   The upside, however, far outweighs the potential problems.  The lottery is a tax , and a  poorly designed one  at that. Getting the state out of the lottery business would be a step in the right direction. The  New York Times  article continues: ""This is fundamentally a retail business, and governments are not equipped to manage retail businesses,"" said John Filan, the chief operating officer of the state of Illinois. ""Gaming is getting so competitive around the world that we're worried our revenues could go down unless there is retail expertise.""  Filan is correct that the state is not equipped to handle this retail business, but not for lack of ability to remain competitive. Many states are adding video lottery terminals and other lottery innovations to remain competitive, and Illinois could do likewise. Illinois should not be in the lottery business for one reason only: running a lottery is not an appropriate activity for government.  Lottery revenue constitutes an implicit tax that is paid disproportionately by the poor, is not transparent (clear to taxpayers as tax revenue), and is not economically neutral. For these reasons--not for lack of sophisticated equipment or retail expertise--Illinois should get out of the lottery business, a business it should never have been part of in the first place. If this sale takes place, the next logical question is, will other private companies be allowed to run their own lotteries at some point? Lotteries were illegal in all states for over half of the last century; when states began enacting lotteries they removed constitutional lottery bans only to create government monopolies. But if Illinois sells its lottery to a private company, will this open the door for other privately run lotteries someday, akin to the state's privately run casinos? What would be the state's justification for creating a lottery monopoly for one company? A sales tax on freely competing, privately run lotteries could continue to generate revenue for the state without all the  tax policy problems of state-run lotteries .

While other outrageous fiscal events trump the states fiasco, it is worth noting that no one in California actually thinks the states budget problems are solved. Rather, theyve plastered over a mess that will worsen with economic conditions next year and make it even tougher to balance the budget after that.      more   »                  Leave Comment   |                Permanent Link                                       Sarah Palin and Taxes        by        Howard Gleckman    on Tue 02 Sep 2008 01:28 PM EDT       When it comes to taxes, Sarah Palin turns out to be an intriguing mix of Barack Obama and John McCain. Like Obama, she favors a tax rebate for consumers funded by a windfall profits tax on energy companies. But, like McCain, she also backs a gas tax holiday.       more   »                  Comments (1)   |                Permanent Link                                       The Supreme Court and Muni Bonds        by        KimRueben    on Fri 23 May 2008 08:25 AM EDT       On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled that states may offer special tax breaks to residents for investing in municipal bonds issued by them and local governments within the state. The 7-2 decision, in Kentucky Department of Revenue v. Davis was widely expected. But even if the Court wanted to bar states from preferring their own bonds over those from other jurisdictions, the current troubles of the $2.6 trillion municipal bond market probably made that impossible.     more   »                  Leave Comment   |                Permanent Link                                       The Gas Tax Holiday: Can the States Do Any Better?        by        KimRueben    on Fri 02 May 2008 12:04 PM EDT       While TaxVox and others have disclosed the folly of a federal tax holiday, some have suggested that temporary state gas tax relief might work better. Some New York State legislators are already pushing for such a plan. But before cash-strapped states jump on the bandwagon, they might consider how a previous experiment in Illinois and Indiana worked out. In 2000, Indiana announced that it would be suspending its 5 percent gasoline sales tax for 120 days beginning July 1. In response, Illinois also suspended its levy for six months that July.. Quaint as it seems today, the changes were spurred by a spring spike in Midwest gas prices to (gasp) $2.00  a level drivers would now gladly embrace.        more   »                  Leave Comment   |                Permanent Link                                       The Credit Crisis and the States: Only Getting Worse        by        Howard Gleckman    on Thu 13 Mar 2008 05:16 PM EDT        think I need a drink.  Yesterday at TPC, a panel of experts looked at what the credit mess means for state and local governments. The answer is: Nothing good.

Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's ambitious $14.9 billion plan to reform the state's health insurance system has crashed, in part because it was unclear proposed funding sources would raise enough revenue to ensure the program's viability in the face of a deteriorating budget environment. The state is facing a $14.5 billion deficit.      more   »                  Leave Comment   |                Permanent Link                                       States and Recession: What a Difference Six Months Makes        by        KimRueben    on Fri 25 Jan 2008 03:06 PM EST       Six months ago, states were predicting balanced budgets and surpluses. Virtually all had surpluses at the end of fiscal year 2007 and more than half had ending balances equaling at least 10 percent of their general funds. Governors and legislatures were happily talking about property tax relief and expanding medical coverage to the uninsured.    more   »                  Comments (2)   |                Permanent Link                                       Into the Pumpkin Patch        by        Howard Gleckman    on Thu 08 Nov 2007 02:35 PM EST       Bloggers have had a field day ridiculing a year-old decision by the Iowa Department of Revenue that would subject certain pumpkins to state sales taxes. True, the decision was worthy of a Halloween chuckle, but the gigglers are missing the point.    more   »                  Comments (2)   |                Permanent Link                                       Do Seniors Deserve More Tax Cuts?        by        Howard Gleckman    on Tue 06 Nov 2007 02:42 PM EST       An awful lot of Democrats suddenly seem to think that senior citizens are overtaxed.  Presidential hopeful Barack Obama wants to exempt seniors making less than $50,000 from paying any federal income tax. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) has tucked a new $700 above-the-line deduction for real estate taxes into his proposal to extend Alternative Minimum Tax relief for another year. While Rangel doesnt say so, seniors who have paid off their mortgages and no longer itemize would be big beneficiaries of the new tax break.      more   »                  Comments (2)   |                Permanent Link                                       A Burning Tax Issue        by        KimRueben    on Wed 31 Oct 2007 04:30 PM EDT       The wildfires in Southern California should have taught us two major lessons: State and local governments need to be better prepared for predictable disasters and, when it comes to emergency services, you get what you pay for.    more   »                  Leave Comment   |                Permanent Link                                                          Posts and comments are solely the opinion of the author and not that of the Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute, or  Brookings Institution.

Think about it.  What if everyone who belonged to a health club started showing up every day.  The crowding would be intolerable.   But since most people drop out, or come only rarely, the bottom line beefs up, even if you don't.

But, all that being said, exercise is even more important than money.  So if you find a good health club, don't begrudge them a few bucks a day.  It's well worth it.

You should be aware that the value of investments, and the income from them, can fall as well as rise. Returns are not guaranteed and you may not get back what you originally invested. The investments available may not be appropriate for everyone.   Past performance is not indicative of any future return. Where a portfolio contains overseas investments, exchange-rate variations may cause the value of your investment to decrease or increase.   You can withdraw cash from your portfolio when you wish but you should bear in mind that if this necessitates sales of your investments, particularly at a time when stock markets are depressed, this may result in a capital loss.   Back to top                                                                                                             What are traditional asset classes?                                     Traditional asset classes are  Equities ,  Bonds  and  Cash . Over time, the real value of money is gradually eroded by inflation. However, you have a range possible asset classes that may help you to grow your investment over time.   Equities   Equities are considered the riskiest of the three traditional asset classes. Typically, their returns are volatile in the short term, but their volatility is significantly reduced over time. In fact, over most ten-year periods, equities are on average less risky than bonds and offer higher returns, although past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results. An equity (or share) gives you a share in the ownership of a company. A shareholder has a stake in the assets, decision making and profits of a company. If a company goes bankrupt, shareholders are paid last, after holders of bonds, other debt and preferred stock.  For taking on such risk, investors in equities would generally expect a higher return than from investing in the debt of the company. Most, but not all, equities pay dividends a distribution to shareholders of a part of the company profits. Companies with higher rates of growth typically hold on to a larger proportion of their profits and cash flow in order to re-invest in the business, rather than paying to shareholders as dividends.   Bonds   Bonds (or fixed-income investments) are riskier than cash, but less risky than equities. Typically, a bond offers a fixed return (or coupon), payable at regular intervals (usually every six months). In addition, the principal invested is generally returned at the end of the bond duration. Historically, returns have tended to be higher than those from cash investments. Bonds can provide regular income while preserving the capital value of an investment. Bonds are mainly issued by governments and companies. Government bonds from developed economies offer a lower coupon than corporate bonds, reflecting the higher creditworthiness of the issuer.   Government Bonds  A government bond is a transferable security which enables a government to borrow money from investors. The bond generally entitles the holder to regular income payments and repayment of the principal on maturity. Usually government bonds are issued by a government in its own local currency. They are often viewed as free of credit risk, as most governments can print their own currency; and so many investors deem the return of capital as a near certainty.   Corporate Bonds A corporate bond is a transferable security which enables a company to borrow money from investors. Companies may use the proceeds to finance new projects or make new acquisitions. Usually, they promise to pay investors a fixed or variable coupon at regular intervals during the term of the bond and to repay the principal at maturity. An alternative way for companies to raise money is to issue new shares on the stock market.   Cash   Cash is the least risky asset class. However, because the potential long-term rewards are lower than those from bonds and equities, cash investments are more at risk from the damaging effects of inflation. Provided that the investment can be held over at least three to five years, bonds or equities are usually preferable.   Back to top                                                                                                             What are alternative asset classes?                                     Alternative investments are typically those other than stock or bonds which include strategies such as  private equity ,  real estate ,  hedge funds  and  commodities . They provide the advantages of potentially higher return, greater losses and less volatility than other investments.    Private Equity   Private equity is a share in a company that is privately held, not publicly listed on a stock exchange. Investors in private equity purchase holdings in privately held companies in order to tap their unrealised potential and sell the holdings for a profit, generally several years later. Professional investment companies (primarily partnerships) analyse the factors that are likely to influence the long-term success of these private companies: their products, their management, and the market environment. They provide private companies not only with financial assistance but also with their know-how and contacts.   Unlike the manager of a mutual fund (whose performance is compared with a benchmark index), the private equity manager is interested in absolute positive returns over the long term.   The drawbacks of private equity investments include:     Illiquidity and long lock-in periods private equity investors are asked to commit capital, which is then invested over time. This drawdown of committed capital generally stretches over three to five years. At the end of that period, the distribution of capital back to investors may have only just begun.  Hence, performance is typically negative for at least the first three years of an investment.    Unrealised returns in other words, they have not yet been passed on to investors. In the case of younger funds, the returns are almost entirely unrealised and based on partly subjective net asset values (NAVs) made up of the valuations of the underlying holdings (generally carried at cost). Private equity investments are illiquid, and valuations may not always accurately reflect reality. The level of regulation is low, and valuation methods may differ; there are some common principles and guidelines but no strict controls. This factor highlights the importance of conducting rigorous due diligence on a prospective fund manager so as to verify the manager claims and true capabilities.   Property   Commercial property is property that is used by businesses rather than for housing. It can be divided into three major sub-classes: office, retail and industrial. These sub-classes are influenced by different factors and each have distinct risk and return characteristics. As a whole, the commercial property market is driven by different factors to the housing market. Hence, events in the housing market have only indirect implications for commercial property. Investments in commercial property can be made directly (through buying property which is used commercially) or indirectly (for example, by buying shares in listed property companies).   Because of commercial property low correlation with traditional asset classes, it can help to reduce the overall level of risk in an investment portfolio and diversify your portfolio.   Hedge Funds   At least 9,000 hedge funds are now in the market, with reportedly over $1.9 trillion under management. Even so, hedge funds remain one of the most complex and hence, most misunderstood asset classes. Many investors wrongly assume that:     investing in hedge funds is risky;    the primary goal is high returns;    hedge funds perform at their best when stock markets are falling;    the asset class is only available to clients making large investments.    In fact, hedge funds were originally created to provide a low-risk way of achieving consistent returns in any market conditions.   Most hedge funds are private investment vehicles and are not publicly traded. They are set up as limited partnerships, in which the general partners invest a significant amount of their own assets. Unlike most traditional funds, hedge funds can use a variety of tools, such as derivatives and leverage, in order to implement their often complex investment strategies.   The prime objective of hedge fund managers is to generate positive returns regardless of market conditions. They aim to do that by focusing on opportunities that they believe are worth exploiting, while neutralising the risks to which they do not wish to be exposed. During adverse market conditions, they may prefer to hold cash to preserve capital. Hence, hedge fund managers can be seen as risk managers, not just as generators of returns.   Investors often worry about hedge funds' use of leverage or gearing (the amount of borrowing used to finance investment positions).  Yet many hedge funds use no or very little leverage. The majority of hedge funds can use leverage, but most hedge funds have leverage ratios of less than 2:1. Leverage is an acceptable part of an investment strategy, but it requires an understanding of the associated risks and stringent risk control mechanisms to be in place.   Commodities   Commodities are the raw materials used to create the goods we buy and the food we eat. As an asset class, commodities are divided into the following sub-sectors:      Energy, such as oil and gas.    Industrial (or base) metals, such as copper and aluminium.    Precious metals, such as gold and silver.    Agricultural commodities, such as grains (wheat, corn etc.) and soft commodities (cotton, coffee etc.).    Livestock, such as live cattle.   The key difference between commodities and financial asset classes (such as stocks and bonds) is that commodities are tangible, physical, useful assets. That is an important distinction, because it affects the way commodity prices react to changing economic conditions.   As stand-alone investments, commodities look reasonably attractive, judged on their performance over the past ten years. Yet, as with equities, it depends to a large extent on the timing of investments during this period.   Back to top                                                                                                             What are the benefits of diversifying my portfolio?                                     Diversifying your portfolio means not putting all your eggs in one basket.  By spreading your investment between different types of asset classes, you can reduce the risk of a sudden loss in capital value.      Most investments have two main types of risk: market (or economic) risk and specific risk.   Specific risk is the risk attached to a particular security.   For stocks, it will include the company profitability, quality of management and demand for products.  Unlike market risk, specific risk can be reduced by diversifying within the market.  By investing in a wide range of stocks, investors can increase the chances that losses in any one stock will be offset by gains in others.     A portfolio diversified across asset classes gives you greater flexibility while reducing overall risk.  You could keep a proportion of cash investments for short-term requirements, while maximising your growth potential by investing in equities for the long term.  If you also required regular income, you could add some bonds.  For most investors, a mix of equities and bonds can provide optimal returns with minimum risk.    Back to top                                                                                                             What is asset allocation?                                     Asset allocation is the way in which your investments are divided between different asset classes. The aim is to balance risk and create diversity within the investment portfolio.  The asset mix can also refer to the geographical mix of equities and bonds.    Strategic asset allocation is the key long-term framework for portfolios, enabling us to create an optimal mix of assets with an appropriate balance between risk and reward. But the near-term prospects for each asset within a portfolio might change, for better or for worse. So we regularly adjust portfolios to reflect our short-term views of opportunities and risks. This is known as tactical asset allocation.   Back to top                                                                                                             What are ISAs?                                     An Individual Savings Account (ISA) is a tax-efficient savings scheme designed by the Government to encourage you to save. With ISAs you can invest up to a maximum of £7,200 in any tax year, up to £3,600 of which can be invested in a Cash ISA.   Cash ISA   With cash ISA saving, your money will accrue interest as it would in an ordinary bank or building society account, but this interest is tax free. Cash ISAs are useful if you want short-notice access to your money.   Stock and Shares ISAs   Stocks and shares ISAs, like all stock market investments, should be considered as long-term investments. A stocks and shares ISA will invest in the stock market and in bonds, so, although any gains will not be taxed, the capital will also be exposed to the ups and downs associated with shares.   What you can invest   The amount subscribed must not exceed the overall subscription limit of £7,200 in a tax year.   If you don't have a lump sum to invest, you can make regular payments into a stocks and shares ISA.  Please bear in mind that the favourable tax treatment of ISA saving might not continue and that the value of tax relief depends upon your personal circumstances.   Please note: Barclays Personal Investment Management (BPIM) ISAs are invested in stocks and shares only.   Back to top                                                                                                             What is risk?                                     All investments carry risk, and returns can never be fully guaranteed. So it is important to choose an investment that suits your circumstances. If you are prepared to accept a higher level of risk, you will probably wish to hold more equities, as they offer the greatest long-term potential. If you have a lower appetite for risk, you might prefer the income produced by bonds and cash, which tends to be more reliable than equity returns.   As a rule, higher returns can be expected for investments which tie up money for longer periods. A bank deposit account with a withdrawal notice period will generally offer a higher rate of interest than an instant-access account. Similarly, longer-dated bonds tend to offer higher coupons than short-dated bonds. And equities, which confer a permanent (but transferable) share in the ownership of a company, are effectively an open-ended investment and therefore have historically offered higher returns than both cash and bonds over the long term.   Back to top                                                                                                             What are Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Inheritance Tax?                                     Income Tax   Income Tax is a tax levied on your taxable income i.e., earnings, investment income, trading profits etc. You may reduce your taxable income by the entitlement to certain allowances. The personal allowance depends on your age, and is increased at age 65 and age 75. The amounts for 2008/2009 are £5,435 (under 65), £9.030 (age 65 to 74) and £9,180 (age 75 and over). The higher allowances for those aged 65 and over are subject to an income limit of £21,800. After deducting your personal allowance, the amount of Income Tax you pay will depend on the level of your taxable income and the source of that income.    Capital Gains Tax (CGT)   CGT is paid on assets (such as property, shares, antiques, etc) sold or given away that have increased in value in the time that you have owned them. CGT is not payable on personal goods that are worth under £6,000 or, in most cases, your investment property. From 6 April 2008, a flat rate for CGT of 18% applies to almost all taxable gains.  The annual exemption for individuals has increased to £9,600 for the tax year ending 5 April 2009.   Inheritance Tax (IHT)   Inheritance Tax is a tax levied on the estate of the deceased. It is beginning to affect increasing amounts of people, as tax thresholds have not risen in line with housing prices.  The current il rate band or tax-free allowance for inheritance tax, is £312,000.  Taxable assets worth over this amount are taxed at a rate of 40%, which is paid by the executors of the will of the deceased.   There was a further, and very welcome, change to the IHT provisions on 6 April 2008.  Any nil rate band that is not used on a person death can now be transferred to their spouse or civil partner. The new provision applies where the second death occurs on or after 9 October 2007 but the first death may have been at any time. For many married couples, this now means that joint estates of up to £624,000 will not suffer IHT.

Each company will be contributing equipment and technology to the partnership.  Capital improvements are also being made to house these new manufacturing operations within the existing Sportexe operations center.  Sportexes equipment contributions are being financed through its recently announced banking relationship with Wells Fargo.   We are very pleased to continue to expand our investments in the synthetic turf market. Through our partnership with ACT Global Sports, we are creating a state-of-the-art manufacturing and research center, Stephen Noe, CEO of Sportexe said.  While pleased with our current tufting provider, this new partnership will provide us with greater flexibility in our product development and allow us to interact more closely with all our vendors in the supply chain.  With this move, we see tremendous opportunity to be more strategically positioned as one of only a few turf installation companies that have control over their turf production. Additionally, this demonstrates our continued commitment to deliver a superior sporting experience and tangible value to our customers.   ACT Global Sports Managing Director John Baize is equally happy with the agreement.  We are pleased to enter into a strategic partnership with Sportexe, Baize said.  We are making significant manufacturing investments in the North American market, so it is valuable to find a partner with such a high reputation for building excellent sports fields.   Sportexe is one of North Americas largest installers of artificial turf surfaces for recreational and athletic facilities.  Sportexe fields are used by The Baltimore Ravens, New Orleans Saints, San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills of the National Football League.  More than 200 Sportexe fields have been installed at NCAA, NAIA and high school facilities from coast-to-coast.  Sportexe is owned by Insight Equity, a Dallas based private equity firm.   ACT Global Sports brings its international reputation and manufacturing expertise to the partnership.  While ACT Global Sports is headquartered in Austin, TX, it has regional locations in The Netherlands, Cyprus, Hong Kong and China.  The company is one of the largest international artificial turf manufacturers and has ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 quality-certifications.

KALUP LINZY: CUE THE HEARTSTRINGS Kalup Linzy’s serial satires of soap operas and other high-drama forms of popular entertainment exalt and invert icons of gender, glamour and love. Linzy’s Creative Capital-supported project  Keys to Our Heart  is a black and white video that turns its attention to 1930s–60s Hollywood to tell the story of a troubled couple and the misanthropic grande dame who takes interest in them—all dialogue voiced over by the artist.  Keys to Our Heart  premieres as part of Prospect 1, New Orleans, the largest American biennial of contemporary international organized to date, held November 1, 2008 to January 18, 2009.

But in hard times, hungry Iowans shouldn't have to rely solely on gifts; they deserve government help.   Federal nutrition programs strain to serve more participants while food costs rise.  Eastern Iowans should urge Rep. Dave Loebsack and Sens. Chuck Grassley and Tom Harkin to include temporary funding increases for nutrition programs in the next economic stimulus package.   In congressional testimony last July, the chief economist of Moody's  Economy.com  compared potential gains from 13 stimulus options ranging across rebates, tax cuts and spending increases.  Most effective by far was a temporary increase in food stamp benefits, now known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Each additional dollar in SNAP benefits generates $1.73 in increased economic activity, compared with an increase of only 30 cents per dollar cost in cutting corporate taxes.   The Labor Day 2008 State of Working Iowa report by nonpartisan Iowa Policy Project documented the decline since 2001 in Iowa wages for low-wage and median-wage workers and stagnating wages for high-wage workers. While statewide wages stagnated, job-provided health insurance shrank in availability and increased in cost, and college costs rose sharply. Even before the economic meltdown this fall, the report concluded, ""Taking into account wage and income stagnation, stark inflationary pressures, and an increasingly tattered safety net, we are — with each new business cycle — poorer and less secure.""    Maintaining safety nets is a critical government function.

clueweb09-en0005-49-40181	"                       In September 2003, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported                Illinois as having the fifth highest unemployment rate in the country                at 7.1%.             Illinois,                a Dynamic State?          Armed                with the technology to finally refute the policies of tax-and-spend                politicians, the Illinois Policy Institute has the tools to separate                reality from fiction regarding Illinois’ state tax policies.                This                week, Greg Blankenship, director for the Institute unveiled his                first study using the State Tax Analysis Mapping Program (STAMP),                a sophisticated computer model designed to calculate changes in                the Illinois economy caused by changes in tax policy.               The                STAMP model allows policy makers the opportunity to see their proposed                changes prior to implementation. Time and time again, policy makers                have made changes to tax policies and endured unintended consequences.                             What                are these unintended consequences? The most repetitive consequence                is often the lack of revenue actually collected as compared to the                estimated revenue collection expected. For instance, in drafting                Illinois’ FY04 budget, lawmakers levied significant increases                on business taxes and fees in anticipation of receiving $541 million                in new revenue. Based on the Institute’s evaluation as provided                by the STAMP model, the state is likely to only receive about $443.91                million in new revenue from these tax and fee increases, falling                short by $97 million.               Why                does the STAMP model come up with such drastically different numbers                than those of the lawmakers? Tax policy is often scored in a ""static""                model. What this means is that the increased tax rate is simply                just added on to current revenues and current business behavior,                a very simple mathematical equation. What a static model does not                evaluate is the change in business behavior as a result of the tax                policy change. Evaluating behavior along with mathematical calculations                is referred to as ""dynamic scoring.""               Think                of the STAMP model’s performance like physics, ""For every                action there is a reaction."" By imparting increased tax rates                on a particular sector of the economy, and in this case the business                sector, current economic analysis does not account for change in                behavior. The STAMP model does.               For                sake of argument, if a business’ corporate income tax rate                is increased (and in the case of Illinois, increased significantly),                the corporation’s behavior will change. The state’s  action                 to increase tax rates on income will result in a number of  reactions :                employee lay offs (due to less income available to hire or retain                employees); shifting the use of cash by the company (instead of                keeping cash on hand or to be divvied out to shareholders, companies                may increase capital investment in order to reduce its income tax                liability or may not invest in capital at all). Or in a worst case                scenario, the corporation may leave the state altogether in search                of a lower tax haven.               Here’s                where the unintended consequences come into play. Take the worst                case scenario, resulting from an increase on corporate income tax:                the company leaves the state. Not only does the state lose all the                anticipated revenue from that particular corporation’s income,                but employees are now jobless and the state also loses revenue from                existing personal income tax revenues. On the flip side, the increased                number of a now unemployed labor force puts an additional strain                on state government social programs designed to keep the unemployed                afloat until they find new employment. All of a sudden, the one                action (the increased corporate income tax rate) has created a succession                of reactions, all detrimental to the government’s intended                revenue earnings.               The                Institute’s first study provides information for two different                policy changes, the current FY04 budget (which now faces some challenges                in the upcoming veto session) and the economic proposals for the                upcoming FY05 budget.               In                brief, the FY04 budget, passed this spring by the Illinois General                Assembly, will cause the following reactions if these tax and fee                increases are not repealed, according to STAMP model results:                               3,823 jobs                  will be lost                  $110 million                  will be lost in nominal investment                  Only $444                  million will be collected as a result of the increased business                  taxes and fees, $97 million short of lawmakers’ expectations                              The analysis                provided by the STAMP model as presented by the Illinois Policy                Institute should be taken to heart. As history and current practice                in other states show, states that raise taxes during economic slowdowns                fail to resolve budget shortfalls and no longer create an environment                for economic growth and prosperity. In September 2003, the U.S.                Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported Illinois as having the fifth                highest unemployment rate in the country at 7.1%. It was one of                only 12 states to realize an unemployment increase from the previous                month.
