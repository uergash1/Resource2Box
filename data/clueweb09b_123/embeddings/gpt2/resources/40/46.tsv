ROI can set up and run    google adwords   campaigns on your behalf. This type  of marketing is ideal for those  wanting to achieve a high position  on search engine returned results as  you can sponsor keywords and phrases  that will attract people to your  website. Depending on how much you  can achieve a 1st page return. The  downside is that it can become  costly in a competitive business  sector such as    domain name  registration .        Affiliate programs are another ideal  way of generating revenue. You can  either join an affiliate program  whereby you place links on your  website to other peoples and receive  payment should your visitor purchase  anything.    Alternatively you can create your  own affiliate program and get other  website owners to place links to  your site. You then pay the referrer  a commission should the visitor  purchase anything from you.    ROI Designs can install such a  program onto your website very  quickly.

Obsessions are irrational, unwanted, persistent thoughts or images. They are not voluntary and are events that invade a sufferer's consciousness. They can be worrying, repulsive, obscene and blasphemous. They cause immense anxiety and cannot be controlled. Obsessing over germs and dirt, having things in a particular order and nagging doubts are common with this disorder. Persistent thoughts of performing sexual acts that are repulsive and thoughts that go against any religious beliefs are also common.    Those who experience OCD may engage in certain rituals, or compulsions, which relieve or minimise anxiety for a period of time. The compulsions are repeated continuously and include hand washing, counting and touching things, constant rules to follow to satisfy doubts and incessant rechecking.   Such activities are performed for at least an hour a day and can significantly interfere with normal daily routines and relationships. Whereas most adults recognise what they are doing is irrational, children may not realise their behaviour is not normal. Research has found that OCD usually appears in childhood or adolescence and symptoms may come and go, ease over time or get steadily worse.   Other anxiety disorders that can accompany OCD are  depression,   eating disorders  and  drug or alcohol abuse.  However, the disorder can often be treated.     Symptoms:     Persistant unwanted thoughts  Obsessions with germs and dirt  Obsessions with order and counting  Obsessions with touching  Chronic worrying  Irritability  Loss of concentration  Trouble sleeping   Causes     Medical Help and Treatment    Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Statistics:    More Statistics >>   Around 1.2 per cent of the population of Britain have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) at any one time, according to the ONS survey. Other studies suggest that up to 3 per cent of the population will experience OCD at some time in their lives a much higher lifetime prevalence than has been previously assumed.     [24]      It appears that studies are divided over whether this is more common for women: the ONS survey gives a female to male ratio of 15:9, whereas other studies have suggested no clear gender difference in diagnostic rates for OCD.

Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students.

Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.          Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence.

Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell .

It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.

[ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.

[ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of  Lincoln . The current Hall Warden is Mrs. J. Wright.   The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.          Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence.

Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell . It houses about 200 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The current hall president is Mr. Pasan Fernando.     [ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction).

The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.

Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of  Lincoln . The current Hall Warden is Mrs. J. Wright.   The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.            Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for around 260 students. The hall is named after the local Willoughby (or Willughby) family, whose family home  Wollaton Hall  is just across the road from the university. 2007 saw the addition of  The Mix , the largest of the 4 on campus, and subsequently the largest hall bar. The current warden is Professor Bernard McGuirk.     [ edit ]   Jubilee Campus          Melton Hall       Melton Hall  is a mixed postgraduate hall of residence, named after the local town of  Melton . It provides accommodation for 149 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir  Michael Hopkins .          Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell . It houses about 200 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The current hall president is Mr. Pasan Fernando.     [ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.       Broadgate Park  is a collection of self catered student accommodation, forming Europe's largest [ citation needed ]  'student village' of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is operated privately by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd and is situated adjacent to University park in the area of Beeston. The current Warden is Dr Steve Greedy of the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering.   Raleigh Park  is a self-catering hall located close to Jubilee Campus, owned and operated by Derwent Living. It consists of five courts: Sillitoe, Madison, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley. Sillitoe, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley consist of flats whereas Madison Court includes both flats and houses.   St. Peter's Court  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by Unite, who run numerous other third party halls across the country. Recently extended it can now house over 800 students all with en suite rooms.   Cloister House  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd. Housing almost 70 postgraduate students outside the south east corner of University Park in the Dunkirk area.   Albion House  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd. Housing over 160 postgraduate students in Beeston. For the 2008/9 academic year Albion House has been let solely to Nottingham Trent University students.     [ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.            Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence.

Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell .

[ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.

Housing over 160 postgraduate students in Beeston. For the 2008/9 academic year Albion House has been let solely to Nottingham Trent University students.     [ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew.

Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students.

Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park.

Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of  Lincoln . The current Hall Warden is Mrs. J. Wright.   The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.            Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for around 260 students. The hall is named after the local Willoughby (or Willughby) family, whose family home  Wollaton Hall  is just across the road from the university. 2007 saw the addition of  The Mix , the largest of the 4 on campus, and subsequently the largest hall bar. The current warden is Professor Bernard McGuirk.

It provides accommodation for 149 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir  Michael Hopkins .          Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell . It houses about 200 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The current hall president is Mr. Pasan Fernando.     [ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.       Broadgate Park  is a collection of self catered student accommodation, forming Europe's largest [ citation needed ]  'student village' of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is operated privately by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd and is situated adjacent to University park in the area of Beeston. The current Warden is Dr Steve Greedy of the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering.   Raleigh Park  is a self-catering hall located close to Jubilee Campus, owned and operated by Derwent Living. It consists of five courts: Sillitoe, Madison, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley. Sillitoe, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley consist of flats whereas Madison Court includes both flats and houses.   St. Peter's Court  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by Unite, who run numerous other third party halls across the country.

Housing almost 70 postgraduate students outside the south east corner of University Park in the Dunkirk area.   Albion House  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd. Housing over 160 postgraduate students in Beeston. For the 2008/9 academic year Albion House has been let solely to Nottingham Trent University students.     [ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers.

Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.

[ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House.

The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.

Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of  Lincoln . The current Hall Warden is Mrs. J. Wright.   The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.            Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence.

Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell .

[ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.       Broadgate Park  is a collection of self catered student accommodation, forming Europe's largest [ citation needed ]  'student village' of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students.

[ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

Newcastle is a fantastic city to live and study in - why not come and experience it for yourself?        The city is one of the most exciting, friendly and cosmopolitan in the UK. It is fast becoming an internationally renowned centre of culture and science.   It's a place of stylish shops, café-bars and enterprise, with great nightlife,   sport and culture. There are also loads of parks which offer a more laid-back feel.    Modern, innovative landmarks in the city include the award-winning   Gateshead Millennium Bridge, the BALTIC, the Sage Gateshead music centre and the   awe-inspiring 'Angel of the North' sculpture.         “I also like to get to the theatre as often as possible (especially when the RSC are on tour) and to the Tyneside cinema, which regularly shows foreign language films that you can’t find at the Odeon. ”   Thomas Snell  French Studies, MLitt            Getting Around     Newcastle is a very compact city;  travelling around   is really easy. We have an extensive bus network and an underground Metro system with stations linking popular  student residential areas   with the campus. It's also simple to visit the  region .

Buchanan Street  is one of the  main shopping  thoroughfares in  Glasgow , the largest city in  Scotland . It forms the central stretch of Glasgow's famous shopping district with a generally more upmarket range of shops than its two neighbours  Argyle Street , and  Sauchiehall Street .          Buchanan Street looking southward. The green glass entrance to Buchanan Street subway station is visible through the crowd, and the St. Enoch travel centre can be seen at the far end.               Contents       1   History   2   Location   3   Shopping   4   Culture   5   See also   6   References               [ edit ]   History   The land around the north and northeast of Buchanan Street was formerly home to  Buchanan Street railway station . Originally owned by the  Caledonian Railway , then the  London Midland and Scottish Railway  and finally  British Railways , Buchanan Street station was closed in 1966. It was not rated highly either for location, architecture or convenience.  Glasgow Queen Street station  is immediately to the east of Buchanan Street, and the  Buchanan Street station  on the  Glasgow Subway  (which also serves Queen Street Station) is underneath the north end of Buchanan Street. The St. Enoch station of the subway is at the south end of Buchanan Street.   Buchanan bus station  was opened at the northern end in 1978, at the same time as the street itself was pedestrianised between Bath Street and Argyle Street. The most northern reaches of the street were badly run down following the closure of the Glasgow  NAAFI  and the railway station, but this was addressed in the 1990s by the construction of the  Glasgow Royal Concert Hall  in 1990, and the adjoining  Buchanan Galleries  shopping mall in 1998. In 1999, the entire street was repaved with high quality granite stonework and striking blue neon lighting. The combination of impressive  Victorian architecture  and modern urban design won Buchanan Street the Academy of Urbanism 'Great Street Award' 2008, beating both  O'Connell Street  in  Dublin  and  Regent Street / Portland Place , London. [ 1 ]  The area between Argyle Street and St. Vincent Street is particularly popular with  buskers .   The bus station was also substantially redeveloped following the closure of the bus station at  Anderston , and became the principal bus terminus in the city centre. It was renamed simply as ""Buchanan Bus Station"", since the street itself now terminated some distance away due to the building of the Concert Hall.   In May 2002 the Prime Minister  Tony Blair  unveiled a  statue  of the late politician  Donald Dewar  at the northern end of the street.     [ edit ]   Location   It runs south from the junction with Sauchiehall Street. At its north end are the  Buchanan Galleries  and the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall. The  Princes Square  mall and a flagship branch of the  House of Fraser  department store are opposite one another further south, and the street meets Argyle Street at the south, just north of  St. Enoch Square . Buchanan Street is now entirely pedestrianised, but the streets that cross it (Bath Street, George Street, St. Vincent Street, and Argyle Street) are not.   Buchanan Street cuts through Nelson Mandela Place (which was renamed after the former  South African  president) the site of  St George's-Tron Church  and the  Glasgow Stock Exchange  building, and  Royal Exchange Square , which now houses the  Gallery of Modern Art .

During the 1950s, Wittenoom was the Pilbara's biggest town, but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns from  asbestos  mining at the nearby  Wittenoom Gorge .   Today it is a  ghost town  with approximately six residents [ 1 ]  who receive no government services. In December 2006, the  Government of Western Australia  announced that the town would be degazetted, and in June 2007, Jon Ford, the Minister for Regional Development, announced that the townsite status had officially been removed. The town's name was removed from official maps and road signs and the  Shire of Ashburton  is able to close roads that lead to contaminated areas.           Contents       1   History   2   Current situation   3   References   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   Wittenoom was named by  Lang Hancock  after  Frank Wittenoom  (1855-1939) who was his partner in the nearby Mulga Downs Station. The land around Wittenoom was originally settled by Frank Wittenoom's brother, politician Sir  Edward Horne Wittenoom . [ 2 ]   Hancock discovered Wittenoom Gorge in the early 1930s and in 1937 started mining  crocidolite  (commonly known as blue asbestos) there. In 1943 the mine was sold to a  CSR Limited  subsidiary,  Australian Blue Asbestos  Pty Ltd. By the late 1940s, there was a need for a nearby townsite to house the mine workers and their families, and this was gazetted in 1950. The following year CSR requested the town name be changed to Wittenoom Gorge, and in 1974 it was changed back to Wittenoom.   From 1950 until the early 1960s Wittenoom was Australia's only supplier of asbestos with 161,000 tonnes being mined. During that time, 20,000 people lived and worked in Wittenoom. Since then, over 1,000 people have died from asbestos-related diseases including  asbestosis ,  lung cancer  and  mesothelioma . The  National Health and Medical Research Council  estimates that the final death toll will eventually rise to over 2,000. [ 3 ]   The 1990  Midnight Oil  song,  Blue Sky Mine , was inspired by the town and its mining industry, [ 4 ]  as were  He Fades Away  and  Blue Murder  by  Alistair Hulett . The town and its history are also featured in the novel  Dirt Music  by  Tim Winton .   A small number of residents still remained in early 2006, defying the  Government of Western Australia 's removal of services and stated intention to demolish the town. On  30 June   2006 , the Government turned off the power grid to Wittenoom. Between May 2006 and November 2006, three residents took up the government's offer to buy their houses for up to A$39,804, plus an additional solatium of 10% and $10,000 relocation costs.          Blue asbestos (crocidolite) from Wittenoom         [ edit ]   Current situation   A report by consultants GHD and Parsons Brinkerhoff in November 2006 evaluated the continuing risks associated with asbestos contamination in the town and surrounding areas and classed the risk to visitors as medium and to residents as extreme. In December 2006, Minister for the Pilbara and Regional Development Jon Ford announced that Wittenoom's status as a town would be removed, and in June 2007, he announced that the townsite status was officially removed. He also encouraged the remaining residents to accept the Government's relocation offer.   Both the Department of Health and an accredited contaminated sites auditor reviewed the report, with the latter finding that the detected presence of free asbestos fibres in surface soils from sampled locations presented an unacceptable public health risk. The auditor recommended that the former townsite and other impacted areas defined in the report be classified as ""Contaminated - Remediation Required"". The  Department of Environment and Conservation  subsequently classified Wittenoom as a contaminated site under the Contaminated Sites Act 2003 on  28 January   2008 . [ 5 ]  A Steering Committee that includes several Government departments meets regularly to discuss the continuing stages of closure of the area.   However, opinion is not unanimous on the danger posed.  Mark Nevill , a geologist and former  Labor  MLC for the  Mining and Pastoral  district, said in an interview in 2004 that the asbestos levels in the town were below the detection level of most equipment, and the real danger is located in the gorge itself which contains the mine tailings. Residents operate a camping ground, guesthouse and gem shop for passing tourists.

For Raleigh Park near Oxford, see  Raleigh Park, Oxfordshire .          Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.           Contents       1   University Park Campus   2   Jubilee Campus   3   Sutton Bonington Campus   4   University-arranged self-catering accommodation   5   Defunct Halls   6   References   7   External links               [ edit ]   University Park Campus   All halls of residence on University Park Campus are of mixed sex  undergraduate  type, though there are limited number of places for  postgraduates .   Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students. The hall is named after the nearby East Midlands city of  Lincoln . The current Hall Warden is Mrs. J. Wright.   The Hall was designed by the Nottingham architect F.E. Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.          Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for around 260 students. The hall is named after the local Willoughby (or Willughby) family, whose family home  Wollaton Hall  is just across the road from the university. 2007 saw the addition of  The Mix , the largest of the 4 on campus, and subsequently the largest hall bar. The current warden is Professor Bernard McGuirk.     [ edit ]   Jubilee Campus          Melton Hall       Melton Hall  is a mixed postgraduate hall of residence, named after the local town of  Melton . It provides accommodation for 149 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir  Michael Hopkins .          Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell . It houses about 200 students, and along with the rest of the first stage of the campus, was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins. The current hall president is Mr. Pasan Fernando.     [ edit ]   Sutton Bonington Campus   Bonington Hall is the name given by the university to the student accommodation (halls of residence) at Sutton Bonington. It is owned by Opal Property Group. It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.       Broadgate Park  is a collection of self catered student accommodation, forming Europe's largest [ citation needed ]  'student village' of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is operated privately by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd and is situated adjacent to University park in the area of Beeston. The current Warden is Dr Steve Greedy of the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering.   Raleigh Park  is a self-catering hall located close to Jubilee Campus, owned and operated by Derwent Living. It consists of five courts: Sillitoe, Madison, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley. Sillitoe, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley consist of flats whereas Madison Court includes both flats and houses.   St. Peter's Court  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by Unite, who run numerous other third party halls across the country. Recently extended it can now house over 800 students all with en suite rooms.   Cloister House  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd. Housing almost 70 postgraduate students outside the south east corner of University Park in the Dunkirk area.   Albion House  is a self catering hall, owned and managed by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd. Housing over 160 postgraduate students in Beeston. For the 2008/9 academic year Albion House has been let solely to Nottingham Trent University students.     [ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

[ 1 ]  ( Nunavut  and the  Northwest Territories  are larger but are not provinces.) Ontario is bordered by the provinces of  Manitoba  to the west and Quebec to the east, and the  U.S. states  (from west to east) of  Minnesota ,  Michigan ,  Ohio ,  Pennsylvania  (across  Lake Erie ), and  New York  to the south and east. Most of Ontario's borders with the United States are natural, starting at the  Lake of the Woods  and continuing through four of the  Great Lakes :  Superior ,  Huron  (which includes  Georgian Bay ), Erie, and  Ontario , then along the  Saint Lawrence River  near  Cornwall . Ontario is the only  Canadian Province  that borders the Great Lakes.   The capital of Ontario is  Toronto , Canada's most populous city and metropolitan area. [ 5 ]   Ottawa , the capital of Canada, is located in Ontario as well. The  2006 Census  counted 12,960,282 residents in Ontario, which accounted for 38.5% of the national population. [ 6 ]   The province takes its name from Lake Ontario, which is thought to be derived from  ontar:io , a  Huron  word meaning ""great lake"", [ 7 ]  or possibly  skanadario  which means ""beautiful water"" in  Iroquoian . [ 8 ]  Along with  New Brunswick ,  Nova Scotia  and Quebec, Ontario is one of the four original provinces of Canada when the nation was formed on  July 1 ,  1867 , by the  British North America Act . [ 9 ]   Ontario is Canada's leading manufacturing province accounting for 52% of the total national manufacturing shipments in 2004.

The province consists of four main geographical regions:     The thinly populated  Canadian Shield  in the northwestern and central portions which covers over half the land area in the province; though mostly infertile land, it is rich in  minerals  and studded with lakes and rivers; sub-regions are  Northwestern Ontario  and  Northeastern Ontario .   The virtually unpopulated  Hudson Bay  Lowlands in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested; and   The temperate and therefore most populous region, the fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south where agriculture and industry are concentrated.  Southern Ontario  is further sub-divided into four regions;  Southwestern Ontario  (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario),  Golden Horseshoe ,  Central Ontario  (although not actually the province's geographic centre) and  Eastern Ontario .             Bruce Peninsula .       Despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the  Canadian Shield  which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the  Niagara Escarpment  which crosses the south. The highest point is  Ishpatina Ridge  at 693 metres (2,270 ft)  above sea level  located in  Temagami, Northeastern Ontario .   The  Carolinian forest  zone covers most of the southwestern section, its northern extent is part of the  Greater Toronto Area  at the western end of Lake Ontario. The most well-known geographic feature is  Niagara Falls , part of the much more extensive Niagara Escarpment. The  Saint Lawrence Seaway  allows navigation to and from the  Atlantic Ocean  as far inland as  Thunder Bay  in  Northwestern Ontario .  Northern Ontario  occupies roughly 85% of the surface area of the province; conversely  Southern Ontario  contains 94% of the population.   Point Pelee National Park  is a peninsula in southwestern Ontario (near  Windsor, Ontario  and  Detroit, Michigan ) that extends into Lake Erie and is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland.  Pelee Island  and  Middle Island  in Lake Erie extend slightly farther. All are south of 42N  slightly farther south than the northern border of  California .     [ edit ]   Territorial evolution   Land was not legally subdivided into administrative units until a treaty had been concluded with the  native peoples ceding the land . In 1788, while part of the  Province of Quebec (1763-1791) , southern Ontario was divided into four  districts :  Hesse ,  Lunenburg ,  Mecklenburg , and  Nassau .   In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.   By 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home,  Johnstown ,  London , Midland,  Newcastle ,  Niagara , and Western.   By 1826, there were eleven districts:  Bathurst , Eastern,  Gore , Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara,  Ottawa , and Western.   By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst,  Brock ,  Colbourne ,  Dalhousie , Eastern, Gore, Home,  Huron , Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa,  Prince Edward ,  Simcoe ,  Talbot ,  Victoria ,  Wellington , and Western.   In 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the  Province of Canada , and  county  governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating  districts  in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of  Algoma District  and  Nipissing District  in 1858.   The northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after  Confederation . Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council  in 1884 and confirmed by the  Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889  of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Climate     See also:  Environment Canada            Enjoying summer at  Sandbanks Provincial Park  on Lake Ontario.       Ontario has three main climatic regions. Southwestern Ontario, the cities of Windsor, London and the southern half of the Golden Horseshoe region including Hamilton, Niagara and the city of Toronto, have a moderate  humid continental climate  ( Koppen climate classification   Dfa ), similar to that of the inland  Mid-Atlantic States  and the lower Great Lakes portion of the  Midwestern United States . The region has warm, humid summers and cold winters. Extreme heat and cold usually occur for short periods. It is considered a temperate climate when compared with most of continental Canada. In the fall and winter, temperatures are moderated by the delayed cooling of the Great Lakes and conversely delayed warming occurs in spring. The lakes moderating effects allow for a longer growing season than areas at similar latitudes in the continent's interior. Both spring and fall are generally pleasantly mild, with cool nights. Annual precipitation ranges from 75-100 centimetres (30-40 in) and is well distributed throughout the year with a usual summer peak. Most of this region lies in the lee of the Great Lakes making for abundant snow in some areas (London, Goderich for example) while others usually receive less snow than most of Canada because of the shorter, milder winter.          The Thames river in  London, Ontario .       The second climatic zone covers the northern half of Southern Ontario, including the northern portion of the  Golden Horseshoe ,  Central ,  Eastern Ontario  (includes Ottawa) and the southern reaches of Northern Ontario, including the cities of  Sudbury  and  North Bay , which have a more severe humid continental climate (Koppen  Dfb ). This region has warm and sometimes hot summers (although shorter in length than Southwestern Ontario) with cold, longer winters with roughly equal annual precipitation as the south. Along the eastern shores of Lake Superior and Lake Huron, frequent heavy  lake effect snow  squalls increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of 300 centimetres (120 in) and higher on much of the Georgian Bay shoreline including  Killarney ,  Parry Sound ,  Muskoka  and  Simcoe County ; extending southward on the Lake Huron shore from  Bruce Peninsula  to  Sarnia . Such conditions and the absence of long stretches of brutal cold make for excellent winter recreation .   The northernmost parts of Ontarioprimarily north of 50N and with no major cities in the areahave a  subarctic climate  (Koppen  Dfc ) with long, severely cold winters and short, cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons. In summer, hot weather occasionally reaches even the northernmost parts of Ontario for brief periods, although humidity is generally lower than in the south. With no major mountain ranges blocking sinking Arctic air masses, temperatures of -40 C (-40 F) are not uncommon. The snow stays on the ground much longer in here than other regions of Ontario; snow cover is usually present to some extent between October and May.   Severe and non-severe  thunderstorms  peak in frequency from June through August when Ontario becomes an active thunderstorm zone, due to the median position of the continental storm track and the presence of increased warmth and humidity. Thunderstorms form from daytime convective heating. Another severe type of thunderstorm is known as a  Derecho  also common to the midwest US, which is a larger cluster-type thunderstorm mass, often occurring nocturnally and with great forward motion, bringing severe straight-line winds over wide areas and can be damaging to forests, only the Hudson/James Bay Lowlands region rarely experience one. The areas with the highest severe weather frequency in the province are extreme Southwestern (Windsor,Chatham corridor) and Central Ontario (Simcoe County including the city of Barrie), both areas tend to get stronger storms resulting from the  Lake Breeze Front  convergence. [ 12 ]   London  has the most lightning strikes per year in Canada and is also one of the most active areas in the country for storms. In typical year, Ontario averages 20 or more confirmed  tornado  touchdowns, with the highest frequency in southwestern Ontario and near  Lake Simcoe . They are rarely destructive (the vast majority are classified as F0 or F1 on the  Fujita Scale ). In Northern Ontario, some tornadoes go undetected by ground spotters because of the sparse population and remote landscape; they are often discovered after the fact by aircraft pilots, where aerial observations of damaged forest confirm occurrences. Tropical depression remnants can cause copious rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly. One notable exception was  Hurricane Hazel  in October 1954.

[ 13 ]  The French explorer  tienne Brl  explored part of the area in 1610-12. [ 14 ]  The English explorer  Henry Hudson  sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for  England , but  Samuel de Champlain  reached Lake Huron in 1615, and  French  missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes. French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Iroquois, who allied themselves with the British. [ 15 ]           United Empire Loyalists , statue, McMaster University Downtown Centre,  Main Street East       The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century and began a struggle for domination of Ontario. The  1763 Treaty of Paris  ended the  Seven Years' War  by awarding nearly all of  France's North American possessions  ( New France ) to Britain. [ 16 ]  The region was annexed to  Quebec  in 1774. [ 17 ]  From 1783 to 1796, the  United Kingdom  granted  United Empire Loyalists  leaving the United States following the  American Revolution  200 acres (0.8 km) of land and other items with which to rebuild their lives. [ 15 ]  This measure substantially increased the population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence during this period, a fact recognized by the Constitutional Act of 1791, which split Quebec into  the Canadas :  Upper Canada  southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and  Lower Canada  east of it.  John Graves Simcoe  was appointed Upper Canada's first  Lieutenant-Governor  in 1793. [ 18 ]   American troops in the  War of 1812  invaded Upper Canada across the Niagara River and the  Detroit River  but were defeated and pushed back by British regulars, Canadian militias, and  First Nations  warriors. The Americans gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, however. During the  Battle of York  they occupied the  Town of York  (later named Toronto) in 1813. The Americans looted the town and burned the Parliament Buildings but were soon forced to leave.   After the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Britain and  Ireland  rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this deliberate immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers from Europe (mostly from Britain and Ireland) found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed. Still, a mostly agrarian-based society, canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving relations over time.   Meanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications. [ 19 ]   Many in the colony, however, began to chafe against the aristocratic  Family Compact  who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies the power to effect change (much as the  Chteau Clique  ruled Lower Canada). This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of  responsible government  rose in both regions;  Louis-Joseph Papineau  led the  Lower Canada Rebellion  and  William Lyon Mackenzie  led the  Upper Canada Rebellion .   Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent  Lord Durham  to investigate the causes of the unrest. He recommended that self-government be granted and that Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the  French Canadians . Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the  Province of Canada  by the  Act of Union (1840) , with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as  Canada West .  Parliamentary   self-government  was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power.   An economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada.   A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during the  American Civil War , led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The  British North America Act  took effect on  July 1 ,  1867 , establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces:  Nova Scotia ,  New Brunswick , Quebec and Ontario. The  Province of Canada  was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and  school boards  were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.     [ edit ]   Province of Ontario   Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer  Oliver Mowat  became premier and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than  John A. Macdonald  had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the  District of Keewatin ) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the  Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889 . He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called  Empire Ontario .   Beginning with Sir John A. Macdonald's National Policy (1879) and the construction of the  Canadian Pacific Railway  (1875-1885) through Northern Ontario and the  Canadian Prairies  to  British Columbia , Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but only for a few short years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railroad to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.   Mineral  exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast like  Sudbury ,  Cobalt  and  Timmins . The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled  Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario , later  Ontario Hydro . The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada was established in 1904.  General Motors  of Canada Ltd. was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry would go on to become the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy.   In July 1912, the Conservative government of Sir  James P. Whitney  issued  Regulation 17  which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French-Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist  Henri Bourassa  denouncing the ""Prussians of Ontario"". It was eventually repealed in 1927.   Influenced by events in the United States, the government of Sir  William Hearst  introduced  prohibition  of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the  Ontario Temperance Act . However, residents could distil and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, which allowed Ontario to become a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor into the United States, which was under complete prohibition. Prohibition came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the  Liquor Control Board of Ontario  by the government of  George Howard Ferguson . The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament  Kim Craitor  suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier  Dalton McGuinty .   The post- World War II  period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario, and the  Greater Toronto Area  in particular, have been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and after changes in federal  immigration law , a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely  ethnically  British province, Ontario has rapidly become very culturally diverse.   The nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the  Parti Qubcois  in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result Toronto surpassed Montreal as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. Depressed economic conditions in the  Maritime Provinces  have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.   Ontario has no official language, but  English  is considered the  de facto  language. Numerous  French language  services are available under the  French Language Services Act  of 1990 in designated areas where sizable  francophone  populations exist.

Groups with greater than 200,000 responses are included. The majority of Ontarians are of British (English, Scottish, Welsh) and Irish ancestry.   The vast majority of Ontarians are of  British  or other  European descent . Slightly less than five percent of the population of Ontario is  Franco-Ontarian , that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11% of the population.   In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration,  immigration  is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it has been over the last two centuries. More recent sources of  immigrants  with already large or growing communities in Ontario include  West Indians  ( Jamaicans ,  Trinidadians ,  Guyanese ),  South Asians  (e.g.  Pakistanis ,  Indians ,  Bangladeshis  and  Sri Lankans ), East Asians (mostly  Chinese  and  Filipinos ),  Central /South Americans (such as  Colombians ,  Mexicans ,  Hondurans ,  Argentinans , and  Ecuadorians ),  Eastern Europeans  such as  Russians  and  Bosnians , and groups from  Somalia ,  Iran , and  West Africa . Most populations have settled in the Greater Toronto area. A smaller number have settled in other cities such as  London ,  Kitchener ,  Hamilton ,  Windsor ,  Barrie , and Ottawa.     [ edit ]   Religion   The largest denominations by number of adherents according to the 2001 census were the  Roman Catholic Church  with   3,866,350 (34 %); the  United Church of Canada  with 1,334,570 (12 %); and the  Anglican Church of Canada  with 985,110 (9 %).

Absolute World  will be the tallest building in Ontario outside of Toronto when it is completed in 2009 in  Mississauga .           Main article:  Economy of Ontario       Ontario's rivers, including its share of the  Niagara River , make it rich in  hydroelectric energy . [ 28 ]  Since the privatization of  Ontario Hydro  which began in 1999,  Ontario Power Generation  runs 85% of electricity generated in the province, of which 41% is  nuclear , 30% is  hydroelectric  and 29% is  fossil fuel  derived. OPG is not however responsible for the transmission of power, which is under the control of  Hydro One . Despite its diverse range of power options, problems related to increasing consumption, lack of energy efficiency and aging nuclear reactors, Ontario has been forced in recent years to purchase power from its neighbours  Quebec  and  Michigan  to supplement its power needs during peak consumption periods.   An abundance of natural resources, excellent transportation links to the American heartland and the inland Great Lakes making ocean access possible via ship containers, have all contributed to making  manufacturing  the principal  industry , found mainly in the Golden Horseshoe region, which is the largest industrialized area in Canada. Important products include  motor vehicles ,  iron ,  steel , food, electrical appliances, machinery,  chemicals , and  paper . Ontario surpassed Michigan in  car  production, assembling 2.696 million vehicles in 2004.   However, as a result of steeply declining sales, on  November 21 ,  2005 ,  General Motors  announced massive layoffs at production facilities across North America including two large GM plants in  Oshawa  and a drive train facility in  St. Catharines  which by 2008 will result in 8,000 job losses in Ontario alone. Subsequently in  January 23 ,  2006 ,  Ford Motor Company  announced between 25,000 and 30,000 layoffs phased until 2012; Ontario was spared the worst, but job losses were announced for the  St. Thomas  facility and the  Windsor  casting plant. However, these losses will be offset by Ford's recent announcement of a hybrid vehicle facility slated to begin production in 2007 at its  Oakville  plant and GM's re-introduction of the  Camaro  which will be produced in Oshawa. On Dec. 4th of 2008  Toyota  announced the grand opening of the RAV 4 plant in  Woodstock [ 29 ] , and  Honda  also has plans to add an engine plant at its facility in  Alliston .           Toronto : Ontario's capital city and Canada's largest metropolis.       Toronto, the capital of Ontario, is the centre of Canada's financial services and banking industry. Suburban cities in the  Greater Toronto Area  like  Brampton ,  Mississauga  and  Vaughan  are large product distribution and IT centres, in addition to having various manufacturing industries. The  information technology  sector is also important, particularly in the  Waterloo Region .  Hamilton  is the largest steel manufacturing city in Canada, and  Sarnia  is the centre for petrochemical production.  Construction  employs at least 7% of the work force, but because of undocumented workers, the figure is likely over 10%. This sector has thrived over the last ten years because of steadily increasing new house and condominium construction combined with low mortgage rates and climbing prices, particularly in the Greater Toronto area.  Mining  and the forest products industry, notably  pulp and paper , are vital to the economy of Northern Ontario. More than any other region, tourism contributes heavily to the economy of Central Ontario, peaking during the summer months owing to the abundance of fresh water recreation and wilderness found there in reasonable proximity to the major urban centres. At other times of the year,  hunting ,  skiing  and  snowmobiling  are popular. This region has some of the most vibrant fall colour displays anywhere on the continent, and tours directed at overseas visitors are organized to see them. Tourism also plays a key role in border cities with large casinos, among them Windsor,  Rama , and  Niagara Falls , which attract many U.S. visitors. [ 30 ]     [ edit ]   Agriculture   Once the dominant industry,  agriculture  occupies a small percentage of the population. The number of farms has decreased from 68,633 in 1991 to 59,728 in 2001, but farms have increased in average size, and many are becoming more mechanized. Cattle, small grains and  dairy  were the common types of farms in the 2001 census. The fruit, grape and vegetable growing industry is located primarily on the  Niagara Peninsula  and along Lake Erie, where  tobacco  farms are also situated. Tobacco production has decreased leading to an increase in some other new crop alternatives gaining popularity, such as  hazelnuts  and  ginseng . The Ontario origins of  Massey-Ferguson  Ltd., once one of the largest farm implement  manufacturers  in the world, indicate the importance agriculture once had to the Canadian economy.   Southern Ontario's limited supply of agricultural land is going out of production at an increasing rate. Urban sprawl and farmland severances contribute to the loss of thousands of acres of productive agricultural land in Ontario each year. Over 2,000 farms and 150,000 acres (610 km 2 ) of farmland in the GTA alone were lost to production in the two decades between 1976 and 1996. This loss represented approximately 18% of Ontario's Class 1 farmland being converted to urban purposes. In addition, increasing rural severances provide ever-greater interference with agricultural production.     [ edit ]   Transportation   Historically, the province has used two major east-west routes, both starting from  Montreal  in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was pioneered by early French-speaking fur traders, travels northwest from Montreal along the  Ottawa River , then continues westward towards  Manitoba . Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa,  North Bay ,  Sudbury ,  Sault Ste. Marie , and  Thunder Bay . The much more heavily travelled southerly route, which was driven by growth in predominantly English-speaking settlements originated by the  United Empire Loyalists  and later other  European  immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include  Kingston ,  Oshawa , Toronto,  Mississauga ,  Kitchener/Waterloo , London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century. Most of Ontario's major transportation infrastructure is oriented east-west and roughly follows one of these two original routes.     [ edit ]   Roads       Main article:  Roads in Ontario               Highway 401 , running 817.9 km east/northeast from Windsor to the Quebec border is one of the busiest highways in the world. [ 31 ] [ 32 ]       400-Series Highways  make up the primary vehicular network in the south of province, and they connect to numerous border crossings with the U.S., the busiest being the  Detroit-Windsor Tunnel  and  Ambassador Bridge  (via  Highway 401 ) and the  Blue Water Bridge  (via  Highway 402 ). The primary highway along the southern route is  Highway 401 , the busiest highway in North America [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  and the backbone of Ontario's road network, tourism, and economy, [ 31 ] [ 32 ]  while the primary highways across the north are  Highway 417 / Highway 17  and  Highway 11 , both part of the  Trans-Canada Highway .  Highway 400 / Highway 69  connects Toronto to Northern Ontario. Other  provincial highways  and regional roads inter-connect the remainder of the province.     [ edit ]   Waterways   The  St. Lawrence Seaway , which extends across most of the southern portion of the province and connects to the  Atlantic Ocean , is the primary water transportation route for cargo, particularly iron ore and grain. In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century they have been nearly totally supplanted by vehicle, rail, and air travel. There was previously a ferry connecting Toronto with  Rochester, New York .     [ edit ]   Railways          The  O-Train , Ottawa's  light rail  train system (LRT).       Via Rail  operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the  Quebec City-Windsor Corridor , along with ""The Canadian"", a transcontinental rail service from Toronto to  Vancouver . Additionally,  Amtrak  rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including  Buffalo ,  Albany , and  New York City .  Ontario Northland  provides rail service to destinations as far north as  Moosonee  near  James Bay , connecting them with the south.   Freight rail  is dominated by the founding cross-country  Canadian National Railway  and  CP Rail  companies, which during the 1990s sold many  short rail lines  from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south.   Regional  commuter rail  is limited to the provincially owned  GO Transit , which serves a train/bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with its hub in Toronto.   The  Toronto Transit Commission  operates the province's only  subway  and  streetcar  system, one of the busiest in North America. Outside of Toronto, the  O-Train   Light rail  line operates in Ottawa with expansion of the line and proposals for additional lines.     [ edit ]   Air travel   Lester B. Pearson International Airport  is the  nation's busiest  and the world's 29th busiest, handling over 30 million passengers per year. Other important airports include  Ottawa International Airport  and Hamilton's  John C. Munro International Airport , which is an important courier and freight aviation centre. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in  Air Canada 's Rapidair triangle, Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point is  Montral-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport ).  WestJet  also operates many flights in the triangle. A third and new airline,  Porter Airlines  recently made  Toronto City Centre Airport  their hub.   Most Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from  Air Canada Jazz  or smaller airlines and charter companiesflights from the larger cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury,  North Bay ,  Timmins , Windsor, London, and  Kingston  feed directly into Toronto Pearson.  Bearskin Airlines  also runs flights along the northerly east-west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, and Thunder Bay directly without requiring connections at Toronto Pearson.   Isolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on  air service  for travel, goods, and even ambulance services, since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail.     [ edit ]   Government          The wordmark of the Government of Ontario, featuring a stylized version of the provincial flower, the trillium. This wordmark was introduced in late 2007.              The previous wordmark of the Government of Ontario, which was in use from the late-1960s until 2007 (not counting the lettering used here).              The  Ontario Legislature  at  Queen's Park.       The  British North America Act  1867  section 69 stipulated ""There shall be a Legislature for Ontario consisting of the  Lieutenant Governor  and of One House, styled the  Legislative Assembly of Ontario ."" The assembly has 107 seats representing  ridings  elected in a  first-past-the-post  system across the province. The legislative buildings at  Queen's Park  in Toronto are the seat of government. Following the  Westminster system , the leader of the party holding the most seats in the assembly is known as the "" Premier and President of the Council "" (Executive Council Act R.S.O. 1990). The Premier chooses the  cabinet  or  Executive Council  whose members are deemed ""ministers of the Crown."" Although the  Legislative Assembly Act (R.S.O. 1990)  refers to  members of the assembly , the legislators are now commonly called MPPs ( Members of the Provincial Parliament ) in English and  dputs de l'Assemble lgislative  in French, but they have also been called MLAs ( Members of the Legislative Assembly ), and both are acceptable. The title of  Prime Minister of Ontario , while permissible in English and correct in French ( le Premier ministre ), is generally avoided in favour of ""Premier"" to avoid confusion with the Prime Minister of Canada.   Further information:  Monarchy in Ontario  and  Executive Council of Ontario     [ edit ]   Politics       Main article:  Politics of Ontario       Ontario has traditionally operated under a three-party system. In the last few decades the liberal  Ontario Liberal Party , conservative  Ontario Progressive Conservative Party , and social-democratic  Ontario New Democratic Party  have all ruled the province at different times.   Ontario is currently under a  Liberal  government headed by Premier  Dalton McGuinty . The present government, first elected in 2003,  was re-elected  on  10 October   2007 .   Federally, Ontario is known as being the province that offers strong support for the  Liberal Party of Canada . Currently, half of the party's 76 seats in the  Canadian House of Commons  represent Ontario ridings. Although, in the 2008 federal election, for the first time since the Mulroney government, the Conservatives won a plurality of the seats and the vote. As the province has the most seats of any province in Canada, earning support from Ontario voters is considered a crucial matter for any party hoping to win a  Canadian federal election .

During a blizzard early in 1971, highway travellers stranded at a Highway 401 service center, with Premier Robarts (in his last months of office), asked him the slogan in an ironic twist.   In 1967, in conjunction with the celebration of  Canada's centennial , the song "" A Place to Stand "" was introduced at the inauguration of Ontario's pavilion at the  Expo 67   World's Fair , and became the background for the province's advertising for decades.   In 1973 the first slogan to appear on  licence plates  in Ontario was ""Keep It Beautiful"". This was replaced by ""Yours to Discover"" in 1982, [ 34 ]  apparently inspired by a tourism slogan, ""Discover Ontario,"" dating back to 1927. [ 35 ]  (From 1988 to 1990, [ 36 ]  ""Ontario Incredible"" [ 37 ]  gave ""Yours to Discover"" a brief respite.)   In 2007, a new song replaced "" A Place to Stand "" after four decades. "" There's No Place Like This "" (Un Endroit Sans Pareil) is featured in current  television advertising , performed by Ontario artists including  Molly Johnson ,  Brian Byrne ,  Tomi Swick  (from  Hamilton ) and  Keshia Chante  (born in  Ottawa ). [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Famous Ontarians   The singer-songwriter, guitarist, and film director  Neil Young  was born in  Toronto  and spent part of his childhood in  Omemee , a town he memorialized in his song  ""Helpless""  (written for Young's band  Crazy Horse  but most famously recorded on the  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  album  Dj Vu ). The first lines of the song read, ""There is a town in north Ontario / With dream comfort memory to spare / And in my mind I still need a place to go / All my changes were there.""

The first London museum of its kind, the  Churchill Museum  covers all ninety years of Winston Churchill life, divided into five chapters: his early year as British Prime Minister starting May 1940; his later years; his childhood; his early political career and the period famously known as the athering Storm   The  Churchill Museum  uses cutting edge technology and unique media displays to chart the life of Winston Churchill, including a fifteen metre long ifeline which visitors can touch to access a digital iling cabinetof Churchill life, categorised by time.   The  Cabinet War Rooms  which now house the Churchill Museum are the very place that Sir Winston Churchill directed the British war efforts of World War II.    Highlights of the  Cabinet War Rooms  include the Map Room - the hub and planning centre; the Cabinet Room used for meetings of British decision makers; Churchill Room where he slept when unable to return to No.10 Downing St; and the Transatlantic Telephone Room where Churchill would converse with the American President and strategise their war efforts.   As fun as it is informative, the  Churchill Museum & Cabinet War Rooms  is a must of your sightseeing tour of London.                                                    Other attractions in close proximity: A Banqueting House Torre das Jas City Cruises Thames River Cruise                                                                                                                                                        Exchange Links      •  Privacy Policy    •  Legal Notice    •  Other City Cards      •  Affiliates/Marketing    •  Press Office    •  Awards    •  Site Map            London Pass  |  Visitas Turísticas a Londres  |  Torre de Londres  |  Atracções Turísticas em  Londres  |  Comprar Passes de Londres  |  Locais de Interesse em Londres  |  VisitLondon  |  O que fazer em Londres  |  O que ver em Londres  |  ZSL Zoo de  Londres  |  Museus em Londres  |  Galerias  |  Palácio de Buckingham  |  Palácio de  Hampton Court  |  Palácio de Kensington  |  Catedral de São  Paulo  |  Exposição da Tower Bridge  |  Teatro Globe de Shakespeare  |  Travelcard Londres  |  Viagem a Londres  |  Transportes de Londres  - Metro de Londres  |  Passe de Transportes Travelcard e Passe de Turista Londres  |  Museu de Londres  |  Castelos de Londres  |  Cruzeiro no Rio Tamisa  |  Wimbledon  |  Covent Garden  |  Wagamama  |  Harrods  |  Charing Cross  |  Leicester Square  |  Piccadilly Circus                                                             Cesta de la compra         -   La cesta está vacía.              Oferecer Termina:  12/01/2009       Top 10 das Atracções     •  Tower of London   •  St Paul’s Cathedral   •  The Tower Bridge Exhibition   •  Windsor Castle   •  London Zoo   •  Kensington Palace   •  HMS Belfast   •  Churchill Museum & Cabinet War Rooms   •  Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Tour and Exhibition   •  Kew Gardens      Top 5 dos Benefícios     • Entrada gratuita para as atracções    • não fique à espera – passe à frente nas filas    • Guia turístico de Londres gratuito     • Mais de £420 em entradas     • Transportes públicos gratuitos*      Quanto é que vai poupar?     • Passe de seis dias - Poupe £123*    • Passe de três dias - Poupe £64*    • Passe de dois dias - Poupe £38*    • Passe de um dia - Poupe £8*       * Free public transport included only when the  London  Pass with travel  is purchased.

clueweb09-enwp03-01-05817	"                     Samuel Brooks          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          Samuel Brooks  (17921864) was born at  Great Harwood , near Whalley in  Lancashire ,  England , the second son of  William Brooks . In 1815 he became a partner in his fathers  Blackburn -based business,  Cunliffe Brooks & Co . This business supplied  cotton   [ 1 ]  and/or textile equipment  [ 2 ]  and also ran a  bank  as a sideline. Around 1819 his father set up Samuel and his two brothers as junior partners in three separate firms of calico printers in Manchester. Samuel opened a small branch of his fathers bank in a corner of his warehouse. Gradually, banking became his principal activity, and in 1826 the bank moved to its own premises. It soon became established as one of  Manchesters  leading banks. In 1830, Brooks chaired the first meeting of the promoters of the  Manchester and Leeds Railway Railway , and became its first deputy chairman.

He drained it and built villas for wealthy businessmen such as himself. The area was named  Whalley Range  after his boyhood home. A tollbar guarded this exclusive area and this place is still called Brookss Bar.     [ edit ]   Brooklands   In 1856 Samuel bought a vast area of land in North  Cheshire  (within  Trafford  since 1974) from the Earl of Stamford and made further purchases later. He enhanced its value by draining, scrub clearance and tree planting. The area was crossed by the  Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway , opened in 1849.     [ edit ]   Railway station   A road crossed this railway between  Sale  and  Timperley  stations, and in 1855, 45 residents petitioned for a station there. The company took no action but in 1859, Brooks negotiated terms for a station. He offered an acre of land for 200, and guaranteed to pay the company 300 if annual receipts had not reached 100 after five years. The unofficial name ""Brookss land"" soon became  Brooklands , and the station so named opened there on  1 December   1859 . Annual receipts reached 100 after two years.     [ edit ]   Private road   As at Whalley Range, so at Brooklands he built a private road in 1862 with land available for superior residences. This road was four miles long and led to the station. It was wide and tree lined, with a sound stone foundation. From Brooklands Station it led straight in a south-easterly direction for 2  miles. It crossed the  Stockport - Altrincham   turnpike  (now the A560) and two minor roads: Dobbinetts Lane and Whitecarr lane. It then used Roaring Gate Lane to  Davenport  Green before providing a further new road to the Altrincham- Wilmslow  road (now the A538) in the village of  Hale . Brookss road can easily be followed today (2007).   Beyond the immediate vicinity of Brooklands, most of this road was not used for development. It may have been made for Samuels own convenience in travelling around his estate. Since World War II, development has been restricted by planning laws and some of the road still passes through greenbelt agricultural land. Other parts are likely to be developed in the near future.
