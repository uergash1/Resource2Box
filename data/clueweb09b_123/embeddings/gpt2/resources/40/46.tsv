Alice/All -  The CAP Pipe Band was from the Brockton Cadet Sqd in Massachusetts. They wore the uniform you mentioned, and when they need to wear a jacket, they wore the old ""Ike"" jackets. The base drummer was the then Mass Wing Commander, Col Ed Raymond, and I believe the Pipe major was one of his sons. Sad to say, but the band does not exsist any more. The Pipe Band did play at a Presidential Inaguaration one year, although I do not remember who the President was.  The USAF Reserve has a Pipe Band, based out of Dobbins AFB I believe. They wear the USAF Reserve tartan, which was approved by the Tartan Society in Scotland. This band has performed all over the world.

In this regard I feel that if you are doing comm. as a specialty track you should want all quals possible in comm..  So to this end you must have MRO to get CUL.

The mission of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) Communications Program is to organize and maintain a reliable, nationwide, point-to-point, air-to ground, and ground mobile radio capability in support of the missions of CAP. 1-2. Purpose. The primary purpose of any CAP communications facility is to provide the commander with the means for controlling his/her units and their activities. In addition, it provides the commander at each echelon the ability to communicate with superior and subordinate commanders.   Lt Tom    --- Outgoing mail is certified Virus Free.

It is  simply NOT true that,            ""Civil Air Patrol does 98 percent of search and rescue in the           United States."" If a reporter had an axe to grind, he could accuse the speaker of simply  lying about the importance of the organization.  That would needlessly create  a major issue which would divert attention from the very valid point she was  trying to make.  It's this sort of glittering generality that gets us into  trouble time and time again.  It would have been very easy to say that we do  ""most of"" the air/ground searches as tasked by the Air Force Rescue  Coordination Center (although I have my serious doubts about that). --Lewis, CPT, C*P   In a message dated 2/19/2001 1:21:10 PM Central Standard Time,  Shawn.Stanford@alltel.com writes:  <<       By The Associated Press                    Wyoming could lose one of four airplanes used for Civil Air           Patrol search and rescue missions if more flying time for the           planes is not logged.                    The Civil Air Patrol is required to log at least 200 hours per           plane. Wyoming's planes in Cheyenne, Laramie, Casper and Jackson           average less than that, meaning one plane could be given to           Colorado, according to Lari Sparks, Powder River Composite           Squadron commander.                    Colorado has 14 Civil Air Patrol planes to cover roughly the           same amount of area as Wyoming, or about 100,000 square miles.

Our folks report to the appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.""  I will be explaining exactly the same thing at our District's Annual Conference in California this weekend, except I will be speaking to Coast Guard Auxiliary communicators, virtually all of whom have been indoctrinated into the ICS organizational model.  Without communications assets anywhere near approaching those within CAP, we find ourselves involved in ICS operations when responding to shoreside maritime SAR cases that have Coast Guard assets on the water and local fire, police and EMS units ashore.  The senior Coast Guard official gets together with the senior shoreside official and they determine who will serve as IC (or flip a coin).  Once done, our Auxiliary land-mobile units deploy as directed by the IC, and utilize existing nets, frequencies and repeaters to pass traffic.  It has worked well for us in several large-scale multi-day exercises and in a few real-world maritime SAR incidents.  Glad to see that you've experienced some of the same growing pains with ICS that we have, and that you're making steady progress to becoming experts at it.

At least around here there used to be an iron curtain at the state boundary.  That all started changing about 7 years ago when we started the Northeast ""Stratops"" conferences.  The wings of the region standardized a lot of procedures and the Ops and ES folks got to know each other.  What really confused things was when we started to change over to ICS the USAF insisted that each Wing have its own IC in the SAR/DR evals, even when they were combined multi wing affairs.  I think finally it is starting to sink in that except for lost aircraft missions where CAP is in charge of the operations by contract between AFRCC and the State, CAP never has an Incident Commander.  CAP is an agency that supplies resources to the ICS organization.  Rarely will CAP be called upon to staff even a Chief level position.  The top CAP official is the Agency Representative.  Our folks report to the appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.  As an example, in a Disaster Relief mission CAP will not have a Comm Unit Director.  The Comm Unit Director could be a CAP member who happens to be appointed to that job for the entire event - controlling CAP and NON CAP communications assets.  That person will report to the Logistics Chief who will almost never be a CAP member.  CAP should figure on accepting functional call signs from the Comm Unit Director who is NOT A CAP MEMBER in most cases.  CAP maintains control of its assets through the Agency Representative who is responsible for accepting and declining assignments.  We have certainly not made the transition completely, but many of us are getting the idea.  We have to be a team player if we want to participate in missions that another agency or jurisdiction has responsibility and authority.  Sometimes we will be assigned the job of air operations and also provide the planning functions for that, but we had better get prepared to manage helicopter assets, and aircraft assets from other agencies if we want to accept that role.  All in all - we have come along way - but we have a long way to go (at least here in NJ) to become the serious air asset that many of us want to become.

Apparently he was surprised to learn that the USAF AUXILIARY has a distinct ""military"" tone and was not just a ""nice casual organization"" (i.e., a flying club).             But please notice that Mr. Chapman's FIRST concern was building flight time for himself.  In short, he was looking for a cheap way to built pilot time, not an expensive way for him to serve his community and nation.             Mr. Chapman may mature somewhat and become a contributing member of the CAP team.  But it will take significant attitude adjustment.

ES is only part of the work we do.  ICS is  part of all our missions, however.  An Airshow, or a Model Rocket shoot, are excellent examples to show ICS as  an excellent way of doing business.  At an airshow, we should accept tactical calls from whoever is in charge of  communications at the airshow, which might very well be delegated to CAP if we have the most qualified  people there.  We have to remember that we don't run the airshow, and what  we do in support of the airshow is under the command of the airshow IC.  For a model rocket shoot CAP actually has an Incident Commander in charge,  since it is a CAP activity.  ICS is a management system which works for any event, and is flexible  enough for little events and big events.  I personally feel that the specialty track should be changed.  A  communicator who has not qualified as an MRO is pretty useless to the  organization, unless they are an engineer who maintains communications  systems.  Remember communications is NOT a mission of CAP.  There are some who claim  that it is a separate mission, as it was not part of early wartime CAP, but adopted from another section of Civil  Defense during the war. Notwithstanding that,  the only reason for CAP  communications to exist is to support the CAP missions.  Every communications effort, expenditure, plan, and exercise must support  the operations of CAP, and not just build a communications infrastructure  for the sake of itself.  CAP radio nets used to have an operational purpose  - to relay traffic in the command structure of the  organization.  Telephones are point to point, not point to multipoint and  VHF and HF nets accomplished that purpose.  The internet has totally replaced that purpose during non emergency  times.  This mailing list is proof of that.  At this time the only purposes  for scheduled nets are for training and equipment testing.  These are not  operational necessities.  Where the training does not directly support a  capability we need for another mission,  or reasonably test network  availability, then they serve no purpose.  I would like to open a dialog on actual useful mission (not ES mission  particularly) tasks which CAP communications are really needed.  By  focusing on the things we really need to support, then we might be able to  properly manage a communications capability within the organization.  I  will send the message separately from this thread.  I do not intend to start a flame war with this post, but hope to get people  thinking about what we are attempting to accomplish with our communications  efforts.  By getting a clear picture of the goals for communications (that  is in alignment with the needs of the organization as seen by the  commanders) we will be more effective in building what is needed.

At least around here there used to  be an iron curtain at the state boundary.  That all started changing about 7 years ago when we started the Northeast  ""Stratops"" conferences.  The wings of the region standardized a lot of  procedures and the Ops and ES folks got to know each other.  What really confused things was when we started to change over to ICS the  USAF insisted that each Wing have its own IC in the SAR/DR evals, even when  they were combined multi wing affairs.  I think finally it is starting to sink in that except for lost aircraft  missions where CAP is in charge of the operations by contract between AFRCC  and the State, CAP never has an Incident Commander.  CAP is an agency that  supplies resources to the ICS organization.  Rarely will CAP be called upon to staff even a Chief level position.  The  top CAP official is the Agency Representative.  Our folks report to the  appropriate level  that they are assigned of the ICS organization.  As an example, in a Disaster Relief mission CAP will not have a Comm Unit  Director.  The Comm Unit Director could be a CAP member who happens to be  appointed to that job for the entire event - controlling CAP and NON CAP  communications assets.  That person will report to the Logistics Chief who  will almost never be a CAP member.  CAP should figure on accepting  functional call signs from the Comm Unit Director who is NOT A CAP MEMBER  in most cases.  CAP maintains control of its assets through the Agency Representative who  is responsible for accepting and declining assignments.  We have certainly not made the transition completely, but many of us are  getting the idea.  We have to be a team player if we want to participate in  missions that another agency or jurisdiction has responsibility and  authority.  Sometimes we will be assigned the job of air operations and also provide  the planning functions for that, but we had better get prepared to manage  helicopter assets, and aircraft assets from other agencies if we want to  accept that role.  All in all - we have come along way - but we have a long way to go (at  least here in NJ) to become the serious air asset that many of us want to  become.  Much of what stands in our way is the ""old way"" of doing business.

Ya never know. This sounds like the first time a test with fast movers like  F-16s has been done over real city lights and most likely to be done with  USAF's top fighter pilots who do the Andrews AFB alert duty.  I'd be  pleasantly surprised if the first test worked 100% given all the  variables.  Still, there have been some wonderful developments in radar,  cockpit systems, and weaponry in recent years.  If we can put a man on the  Moon, we **can** do this simple intercept, ID and destroy procedure even  over Washington DC.  Or... we can play high stakes poker with terrorists as the Allies and Nazis  did with each other over the effectiveness of chaff countermeasures. -------------- next part -------------- An HTML attachment was scrubbed...

I never said otherwise. All I pointed out is, that USAF reg's do say that it is ok for members, veterans and retirees to wear their medals, ribbons and badges on appropriate occassions and on appropriate types of clothing.  I do a lot of Scottish events throughout the year, and I wear my USAF (only) awards and badges on both my Highland Formal and Day articles of clothing. Since these are appropriate articles of clothing and the events are appropriate events, there is no problem. I have been known to wear my Highland Formal to CAP and USAF formal events, in place of my Mess Dress...     I recall seeeing a CAP bagpipe band marching in a photo in a CAP Annual  Report to Congress.  They were wearing CAP blue shirts-USAF-style, with  kilts.  Very snazzy!  Anyone know what happened to that band?  Are they  still marching and piping?  The USAF *does* have a tartan officially  approved by the proper Scottish tartan organization.

If the input numbers are truly random, then a modulos hash will distribute well whether or not the hash size is prime.  However, if the input numbers are not truly random, then a modulos hash may pick out some regularity in the input, and preferentially hash to a given set of buckets.  For a trivial example, if the numbers tend to be even, then an even modulos hash will tend toward using the even numbered buckets.  A prime modulos hash minimizes the types of regularity which will lead to a poor hash distribution.  Unix file system inode numbers are not truly random.  Therefore, it's wise to choose a prime conf-split.  Ian              Follow-Ups :    Re: Why conf-split prime?   From:  Dave Sill         References :    Why conf-split prime?

Funny, I can reproduce it easily.  Sure your random numbers are random? With the attached Python script (it depends on the popular stats.py and pstat.py modules), analyzing 250000 15-bit random integers (read from a text file, one per line), I get the following:  [charlesc@charon personal]$ ./buckets.py 12 13 A:  12 buckets   count:          250000   mean:       20833.3333   std. dev.:  196.3153  B:  13 buckets   count:          250000   mean:       19230.7692   std. dev.:  103.8646   The effect does appear to diminish significantly for large values, though.

My main interest would be in speciation, SI, mixing, forward modeling and inverse modeling.   PHREEQC has an ion-association model, which is limited to the lowest concentrations that you mention. The program will make calculations at higher concentrations, but I think the aqueous model would be suspect. You really need a Pitzer (specific ion interaction) model for the high ionic strengths. Geochemist's Workbench, EQ3/6, TEQUIL, SOLMINEQ, and PHRQPITZ implement Pitzer models. I maintain PHRQPITZ, but I don't advocate its use. It is old and difficult to run, although I am confident that it does the calculations correctly.      Dear David,     Many thanks for your message. I have used PHREEQC for several years in  natural waters and in different ways ( I give a course in UNAM-major  Mexican U¿university).

The conf-split idea makes the assumption that each time an e-mail arrives, a constant number of inodes (say, ""N"") need to be used, and that they might be chosen/allocated consecutively.  So, one wants a prime number which is larger than N (say, ""CS"").  This guarantees that gcd(CS, N) = 1, i.e. that N and CS share no prime factors.  That way, the inode numbers MOD CS will distribute into the CS buckets (the directories) evenly.  The idea breaks down if one chooses N >= CS.  CS = 2 is a particularly naughty choice, because it means that any even N (even = has 2 as a prime factor) will cause the messages not to distribute evenly.  For example, assume inode numbers are incremented by 4 for each file, then we get a sequence like 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, i.e. all the e-mail going into the same conf-split directory.  You wrote:  > It's primeness that matters, not oddness, and 2 is prime.  Actually, primeness does not matter, and oddness does not matter.  What is required is that gcd(CS, N) = 1 (that CS and N share no prime factors). However, DJB chose 23 because it is prime and larger than any conceivable N. In other words, it was the best choice with incomplete information about how a given qmail setup behaves.  It guarantees that all 1 <= N <= 22 will be OK.  CS=2 is an irrational choice only if N is even.  But I'm not sure anybody knows what N is for a practical system, and it might change as the qmail configuration is altered.  A prime number larger than N is the safest choice with incomplete information.  What I'm really trying to say is that 2 for conf-split is really no better than 1.  If N is even, you've bought nothing.  Most e-mail will go into the same directory.  Best regards, Dave.

Exactly.

Which is the defined behavior, and the default behavior in sendmail, qmail, and most other mailers I know of.  Once the mail gets to the lowest-numbered MX, then any funny ""local"" processing happens.  If a host is configured as ""fallback"" but only for use when the primary has a problem, yet the DNS is not changed to reflect the seondary's new status when the primary does fail, then one is sending the world mixed signals, and one gets what one deserves.  The more typical setup is to give them idenitical MXs, in which case even qmail will try more than one given bad delivery problems.   >  > The secondary MX exists to cover cases when the primary is down.

The secondary MX exists to receive mail for holding and requeuing to pass onto the primary when the primary is not reachable by the sender and the sender wants to unqueue the mail.  If you're talking about failover, you either need equal MX weights, or you need to have the DNS adjust when the lower MX goes down.  Anything else is a kludge, and an insistence thatthe world support various kludges, when doing it right is quite simple.  As Russ noted, it may be not ""incorrectly configured"" DNS if the main mail server is down, but it's certainly not correct if you have two hosts acting as final mail destinations yet with differing MX weights, and you expect there never to be a glitch if the lower-numbered one is acting sort-of alive yet is unable to really receive mail.        -M  Michael Brian Scher (MS683/MS3213)  Anthropologist, Attorney, Policy Analyst             Mainlining Internet Connectivity for Fun and Profit    strange@xxxxxxxxxxx     strange@xxxxxxxxxxxx     strange@xxxxxxxxx      Give me a compiler and a box to run it, and I can move the mail.

I'm having the weirdest problems with static routes. It doesn't happen often. When it happens, it can really mess things up. The static route on one of my machines changed earlier today, and the machine stopped allowing people to login. The machine is an alpha 4100, 2GB RAM, 1 NIC, running Tru64 UNIX 4.0f (jumbo pak 1).  It's an SAP test machine. It's set up so that the machine gets a static route on boot up.  It's not running routed or gated. Here are relevant segments of config files:  /etc/routes: default 22.22.22.1  /etc/rc.config: ROUTED=""no"" ROUTED_FLAGS= ROUTER=""no"" GATED=""no"" GATED_FLAGS=""""  And here's what I see for default route when I ran netstat -r:  default          rocdcr1-e0-0.vta.o UGS         0       24  tu0  I also see a bunch of dynamic routes to the PC's that are connected to this machine, but I don't care much about those.  This morning, when I was fixing the static route problem, the default route looked like the following:   default          rocdcr3.vta.org    UGMS        1     6788  tu0  I looked up the man pages and the ""M"" means modified by redirect.  What I've managed to gather from our network guys is that there was some sort of ""network event"" in one of our buildings, around the time the static route changed. It leads me to believe that the machine was trying to respond to connected users, but was not able to reach them. It decided it needs to take another route to reach the connected users.  If this is indeed what had happened, how do I prevent it from happening again? Is there something I can do to make static routes truly unchangeable? Thanks, I will summarize.

Threads make a number of things a lot easier, and are a very useful addition to your bag of programming tricks.       What Is A Thread Anyway?    A thread is a flow of control through a program with a single execution point.    Sounds an awful lot like a process, doesn't it? Well, it should. Threads are one of the pieces of a process. Every process has at least one thread and, up until now, every process running Perl had only one thread. With 5.005, though, you can create extra threads. We're going to show you how, when, and why.       Threaded Program Models    There are three basic ways that you can structure a threaded program. Which model you choose depends on what you need your program to do. For many non-trivial threaded programs you'll need to choose different models for different pieces of your program.       Boss/Worker    The boss/worker model usually has one `boss' thread and one or more `worker' threads. The boss thread gathers or generates tasks that need to be done, then parcels those tasks out to the appropriate worker thread.    This model is common in GUI and server programs, where a main thread waits for some event and then passes that event to the appropriate worker threads for processing. Once the event has been passed on, the boss thread goes back to waiting for another event.    The boss thread does relatively little work. While tasks aren't necessarily performed faster than with any other method, it tends to have the best user-response times.       Work Crew    In the work crew model, several threads are created that do essentially the same thing to different pieces of data. It closely mirrors classical parallel processing and vector processors, where a large array of processors do the exact same thing to many pieces of data.    This model is particularly useful if the system running the program will distribute multiple threads across different processors. It can also be useful in ray tracing or rendering engines, where the individual threads can pass on interim results to give the user visual feedback.       Pipeline    The pipeline model divides up a task into a series of steps, and passes the results of one step on to the thread processing the next. Each thread does one thing to each piece of data and passes the results to the next thread in line.    This model makes the most sense if you have multiple processors so two or more threads will be executing in parallel, though it can often make sense in other contexts as well. It tends to keep the individual tasks small and simple, as well as allowing some parts of the pipeline to block (on I/O or system calls, for example) while other parts keep going. If you're running different parts of the pipeline on different processors you may also take advantage of the caches on each processor.    This model is also handy for a form of recursive programming where, rather than having a subroutine call itself, it instead creates another thread. Prime and Fibonacci generators both map well to this form of the pipeline model. (A version of a prime number generator is presented later on.)       Native threads    There are several different ways to implement threads on a system. How threads are implemented depends both on the vendor and, in some cases, the version of the operating system. Often the first implementation will be relatively simple, but later versions of the OS will be more sophisticated.    While the information in this section is useful, it's not necessary, so you can skip it if you don't feel up to it.    There are three basic categories of threads-user-mode threads, kernel threads, and multiprocessor kernel threads.    User-mode threads are threads that live entirely within a program and its libraries. In this model, the OS knows nothing about threads. As far as it's concerned, your process is just a process.    This is the easiest way to implement threads, and the way most OSes start. The big disadvantage is that, since the OS knows nothing about threads, if one thread blocks they all do. Typical blocking activities include most system calls, most I/O, and things like  sleep().     Kernel threads are the next step in thread evolution. The OS knows about kernel threads, and makes allowances for them. The main difference between a kernel thread and a user-mode thread is blocking. With kernel threads, things that block a single thread don't block other threads. This is not the case with user-mode threads, where the kernel blocks at the process level and not the thread level.    This is a big step forward, and can give a threaded program quite a performance boost over non-threaded programs. Threads that block performing I/O, for example, won't block threads that are doing other things. Each process still has only one thread running at once, though, regardless of how many CPUs a system might have.    Since kernel threading can interrupt a thread at any time, they will uncover some of the implicit locking assumptions you may make in your program. For example, something as simple as  $a = $a + 2  can behave unpredictably with kernel threads if  $a  is visible to other threads, as another thread may have changed  $a  between the time it was fetched on the right hand side and the time the new value is stored.    Multiprocessor Kernel Threads are the final step in thread support. With multiprocessor kernel threads on a machine with multiple CPUs, the OS may schedule two or more threads to run simultaneously on different CPUs.    This can give a serious performance boost to your threaded program, since more than one thread will be executing at the same time. As a tradeoff, though, any of those nagging synchronization issues that might not have shown with basic kernel threads will appear with a vengeance.    In addition to the different levels of OS involvement in threads, different OSes (and different thread implementations for a particular OS) allocate CPU cycles to threads in different ways.    Cooperative multitasking systems have running threads give up control if one of two things happen. If a thread calls a yield function, it gives up control. It also gives up control if the thread does something that would cause it to block, such as perform I/O. In a cooperative multitasking implementation, one thread can starve all the others for CPU time if it so chooses.    Preemptive multitasking systems interrupt threads at regular intervals while the system decides which thread should run next. In a preemptive multitasking system, one thread usually won't monopolize the CPU.    On some systems, there can be cooperative and preemptive threads running simultaneously. (Threads running with realtime priorities often behave cooperatively, for example, while threads running at normal priorities behave preemptively.)       What kind of threads are perl threads?    If you have experience with other thread implementations, you might find that things aren't quite what you expect. It's very important to remember when dealing with Perl threads that Perl Threads Are Not X Threads, for all values of X. They aren't POSIX threads, or DecThreads, or Java's Green threads, or Win32 threads. There are similarities, and the broad concepts are the same, but if you start looking for implementation details you're going to be either disappointed or confused. Possibly both.    This is not to say that Perl threads are completely different from everything that's ever come before--they're not. Perl's threading model owes a lot to other thread models, especially POSIX. Just as Perl is not C, though, Perl threads are not POSIX threads. So if you find yourself looking for mutexes, or thread priorities, it's time to step back a bit and think about what you want to do and how Perl can do it.       Threadsafe Modules    The addition of threads has changed Perl's internals substantially. There are implications for people who write modules--especially modules with XS code or external libraries. While most modules won't encounter any problems, modules that aren't explicitly tagged as thread-safe should be tested before being used in production code.    Not all modules that you might use are thread-safe, and you should always assume a module is unsafe unless the documentation says otherwise. This includes modules that are distributed as part of the core. Threads are a beta feature, and even some of the standard modules aren't thread-safe.    If you're using a module that's not thread-safe for some reason, you can protect yourself by using semaphores and lots of programming discipline to control access to the module. Semaphores are covered later in the article. Perl Threads Are Different       Thread Basics    The core Thread module provides the basic functions you need to write threaded programs. In the following sections we'll cover the basics, showing you what you need to do to create a threaded program. After that, we'll go over some of the features of the Thread module that make threaded programming easier.       Basic Thread Support    Thread support is a Perl compile-time option-it's something that's turned on or off when Perl is built at your site, rather than when your programs are compiled. If your Perl wasn't compiled with thread support enabled, then any attempt to use threads will fail.    Remember that the threading support in 5.005 is in beta release, and should be treated as such. You should expect that it may not function entirely properly, and the thread interface may well change some before it is a fully supported, production release. The beta version shouldn't be used for mission-critical projects. Having said that, threaded Perl is pretty nifty, and worth a look.    Your programs can use the Config module to check whether threads are enabled. If your program can't run without them, you can say something like:       $Config{usethreads} or die ""Recompile Perl with threads to run this program."";     A possibly-threaded program using a possibly-threaded module might have code like this:         use Config;      use MyMod;           if ($Config{usethreads}) {          # We have threads          require MyMod_threaded;          import MyMod_threaded;      } else {          require MyMod_unthreaded;          import MyMod_unthreaded;      }      Since code that runs both with and without threads is usually pretty messy, it's best to isolate the thread-specific code in its own module. In our example above, that's what MyMod_threaded is, and it's only imported if we're running on a threaded Perl.       Creating Threads    The Thread package provides the tools you need to create new threads. Like any other module, you need to tell Perl you want to use it; use Thread imports all the pieces you need to create basic threads.    The simplest, straightforward way to create a thread is with  new():          use Thread;           $thr = new Thread \&sub1;          sub sub1 {          print ""In the thread\n"";      }     The  new()  method takes a reference to a subroutine and creates a new thread, which starts executing in the referenced subroutine. Control then passes both to the subroutine and the caller.    If you need to, your program can pass parameters to the subroutine as part of the thread startup. Just include the list of parameters as part of the  Thread::new  call, like this:         use Thread;      $Param3 = ""foo"";      $thr = new Thread \&sub1, ""Param 1"", ""Param 2"", $Param3;      $thr = new Thread \&sub1, @ParamList;      $thr = new Thread \&sub1, qw(Param1 Param2 $Param3);          sub sub1 {          my @InboundParameters = @_;          print ""In the thread\n"";          print ""got parameters >"", join(""<>"", @InboundParameters), ""<\n"";      }     The subroutine runs like a normal Perl subroutine, and the call to new Thread returns whatever the subroutine returns.    The last example illustrates another feature of threads. You can spawn off several threads using the same subroutine. Each thread executes the same subroutine, but in a separate thread with a separate environment and potentially separate arguments.    The other way to spawn a new thread is with  async(),  which is a way to spin off a chunk of code like  eval(),  but into its own thread:         use Thread qw(async);          $LineCount = 0;           $thr = async {          while(<>) {$LineCount++}                  print ""Got $LineCount lines\n"";     };           print ""Waiting for the linecount to end\n"";      $thr->join;      print ""All done\n"";     You'll notice we did a use Thread  qw(async)  in that example. async is not exported by default, so if you want it, you'll either need to import it before you use it or fully qualify it as Thread::async. You'll also note that there's a semicolon after the closing brace. That's because  async()  treats the following block as an anonymous subroutine, so the semicolon is necessary.    Like  eval(),  the code executes in the same context as it would if it weren't spun off. Since both the code inside and after the async start executing, you need to be careful with any shared resources. Locking and other synchronization techniques are covered later.       Giving up control    There are times when you may find it useful to have a thread explicitly give up the CPU to another thread. Your threading package might not support preemptive multitasking for threads, for example, or you may be doing something compute-intensive and want to make sure that the user-interface thread gets called frequently. Regardless, there are times that you might want a thread to give up the processor.    Perl's threading package provides the  yield()  function that does this.  yield()  is pretty straightforward, and works like this:         use Thread qw(yield async);      async {          my $foo = 50;          while ($foo--) { print ""first async\n"" }         yield;          $foo = 50;          while ($foo--) { print ""first async\n"" }      };      async {          my $foo = 50;          while ($foo--) { print ""second async\n"" }         yield;          $foo = 50;          while ($foo--) { print ""second async\n"" }      };        Waiting For A Thread To Exit    Since threads are also subroutines, they can return values. To wait for a thread to exit and extract any scalars it might return, you can use the  join()  method.         use Thread;      $thr = new Thread \&sub1;          @ReturnData = $thr->join;      print ""Thread returned @ReturnData"";           sub sub1 { return ""Fifty-six"", ""foo"", 2; }     In the example above, the  join()  method returns as soon as the thread ends. In addition to waiting for a thread to finish and gathering up any values that the thread might have returned,  join()  also performs any OS cleanup necessary for the thread. That cleanup might be important, especially for long-running programs that spawn lots of threads. If you don't want the return values and don't want to wait for the thread to finish, you should call the  detach()  method instead.  detach()  is covered later in the article.       Errors In Threads    So what happens when an error occurs in a thread? Any errors that could be caught with  eval()  are postponed until the thread is joined. If your program never joins, the errors appear when your program exits.    Errors deferred until a  join()  can be caught with  eval():          use Thread qw(async);      $thr = async {$b = 3/0};   # Divide by zero error     $foo = eval {$thr->join};      if ($@) {          print ""died with error $@\n"";      } else {          print ""Hey, why aren't you dead?\n"";      }      eval()  passes any results from the joined thread back unmodified, so if you want the return value of the thread, this is your only chance to get them.       Ignoring A Thread     join()  does three things:it waits for a thread to exit, cleans up after it, and returns any data the thread may have produced. But what if you're not interested in the thread's return values, and you don't really care when the thread finishes? All you want is for the thread to get cleaned up after when it's done.    In this case, you use the  detach()  method. Once a thread is detached, it'll run until it's finished, then Perl will clean up after it automatically.         use Thread;      $thr = new Thread \&sub1; # Spawn the thread          $thr->detach; # Now we officially don't care any more          sub sub1 {          $a = 0;          while (1) {              $a++;              print ""\$a is $a\n"";              sleep 1;          }      }     Once a thread is detached, it may not be joined, and any output that it might have produced (if it was done and waiting for a join) is lost.       Threads And Data    Now that we've covered the basics of threads, it's time for our next topic: data. Threading introduces a couple of complications to data access that non-threaded programs never need to worry about.       Shared And Unshared Data    The single most important thing to remember when using threads is that all threads potentially have access to all the data anywhere in your program. While this is true with a nonthreaded Perl program as well, it's especially important to remember with a threaded program, since more than one thread can be accessing this data at once.    Perl's scoping rules don't change because you're using threads. If a subroutine (or block, in the case of  async())  could see a variable if you weren't running with threads, it can see it if you are. This is especially important for the subroutines that create, and makes my variables even more important. Remember--if your variables aren't lexically scoped (declared with  my ) you're probably sharing it between threads.       Thread Pitfall: Races    While threads bring a new set of useful tools, they also bring a number of pitfalls. One pitfall is the race condition:         use Thread;      $a = 1;      $thr1 = Thread->new(\&sub1);      $thr2 = Thread->new(\&sub2);           sleep 10;      print ""$a\n"";          sub sub1 { $foo = $a; $a = $foo + 1; }     sub sub2 { $bar = $a; $a = $bar + 1; }     What do you think  $a  will be? The answer, unfortunately, is ``it depends.'' Both  sub1()  and  sub2()  access the global variable $a, once to read and once to write. Depending on factors ranging from your thread implementation's scheduling algorithm to the phase of the moon,  $a  can be 2 or 3.    Race conditions are caused by unsynchronized access to shared data. Without explicit synchronization, there's no way to be sure that nothing has happened to the shared data between the time you access it and the time you update it. Even this simple code fragment has the possibility of error:         use Thread qw(async);      $a = 2;      async{ $b = $a; $a = $b + 1; };      async{ $c = $a; $a = $c + 1; };     Two threads both access $a. Each thread can potentially be interrupted at any point, or be executed in any order. At the end,  $a  could be 3 or 4, and both  $b  and  $c  could be 2 or 3.    Whenever your program accesses data or resources that can be accessed by other threads, you must take steps to coordinate access or risk data corruption and race conditions.       Controlling access: lock()    The  lock()  function takes a variable (or subroutine, but we'll get to that later) and puts a lock on it. No other thread may lock the variable until the locking thread exits the innermost block containing the lock. Using  lock()  is straightforward:         use Thread qw(async);      $a = 4;      $thr1 = async {          $foo = 12;          {              lock ($a); # Block until we get access to $a              $b = $a;              $a = $b * $foo;          }          print ""\$foo was $foo\n"";     };      $thr2 = async {          $bar = 7;          {              lock ($a); # Block until we can get access to $a             $c = $a;              $a = $c * $bar;          }          print ""\$bar was $bar\n"";     };      $thr1->join;      $thr2->join;      print ""\$a is $a\n"";      lock()  blocks the thread until the variable being locked is available. When  lock()  returns, your thread can be sure that no other thread can lock that variable until the innermost block containing the lock exits.    It's important to note that locks don't prevent access to the variable in question, only lock attempts. This is in keeping with Perl's longstanding tradition of courteous programming, and the advisory file locking that  flock()  gives you. Locked subroutines behave differently, however. We'll cover that later in the article.    You may lock arrays and hashes as well as scalars. Locking an array, though, will not block subsequent locks on array elements, just lock attempts on the array itself.    Finally, locks are recursive, which means it's okay for a thread to lock a variable more than once. The lock will last until the outermost  lock()  on the variable goes out of scope.       Thread Pitfall: Deadlocks    Locks are a handy tool to synchronize access to data. Using them properly is the key to safe shared data. Unfortunately, locks aren't without their dangers. Consider the following code:         use Thread qw(async yield);      $a = 4;      $b = ""foo"";      async {          lock($a);          yield;          sleep 20;          lock ($b);      };      async {          lock($b);          yield;          sleep 20;          lock ($a);      };     This program will probably hang until you kill it. The only way it won't hang is if one of the two  async()  routines acquires both locks first. A guaranteed-to-hang version is more complicated, but the principle is the same.    The first thread spawned by  async()  will grab a lock on  $a  then, a second or two later, try to grab a lock on $b. Meanwhile, the second thread grabs a lock on $b, then later tries to grab a lock on $a. The second lock attempt for both threads will block, each waiting for the other to release its lock.    This condition is called a deadlock, and it occurs whenever two or more threads are trying to get locks on resources that the others own. Each thread will block, waiting for the other to release a lock on a resource. That never happens, though, since the thread with the resource is itself waiting for a lock to be released.    There are a number of ways to handle this sort of problem. The best way is to always have all threads acquire locks in the exact same order. If, for example, you lock variables $a, $b, and $c, always lock  $a  before $b, and  $b  before $c. It's also best to hold on to locks for as short a period of time to minimize the risks of deadlock.       Queues: Passing Data Around    A queue is a special thread-safe object that lets you put data in one end and take it out the other without having to worry about synchronization issues. They're pretty straightforward, and look like this:         use Thread qw(async);      use Thread::Queue;          my $DataQueue = new Thread::Queue;      $thr = async {          while ($DataElement = $DataQueue->dequeue) {              print ""Popped $DataElement off the queue\n"";         }      };           $DataQueue->enqueue(12);      $DataQueue->enqueue(""A"", ""B"", ""C"");      $DataQueue->enqueue(\$thr);      sleep 10;      $DataQueue->enqueue(undef);     You create the queue with new Thread::Queue. Then you can add lists of scalars onto the end with  enqueue(),  and pop scalars off the front of it with  dequeue().  A queue has no fixed size, and can grow as needed to hold everything pushed on to it.    If a queue is empty,  dequeue()  blocks until another thread enqueues something. This makes queues ideal for event loops and other communications between threads.       Threads And Code    In addition to providing thread-safe access to data via locks and queues, threaded Perl also provides general-purpose semaphores for coarser synchronization than locks provide and thread-safe access to entire subroutines.       Semaphores: Synchronizing Data Access    Semaphores are a kind of generic locking mechanism. Unlike lock, which gets a lock on a particular scalar, Perl doesn't associate any particular thing with a semaphore so you can use them to control access to anything you like. In addition, semaphores can allow more than one thread to access a resource at once, though by default semaphores only allow one thread access at a time.     Basic semaphores    Semaphores have two methods, down and up. down decrements the resource count, while up increments it. down calls will block if the semaphore's current count would decrement below zero. This program gives a quick demonstration:         use Thread qw(yield);      use Thread::Semaphore;      my $semaphore = new Thread::Semaphore;      $GlobalVariable = 0;          $thr1 = new Thread \&sample_sub, 1;      $thr2 = new Thread \&sample_sub, 2;      $thr3 = new Thread \&sample_sub, 3;          sub sample_sub {          my $SubNumber = shift @_;          my $TryCount = 10;          my $LocalCopy;          sleep 1;          while ($TryCount--) {              $semaphore->down;              $LocalCopy = $GlobalVariable;              print ""$TryCount tries left for sub $SubNumber (\$GlobalVariable is $GlobalVariable)\n"";              yield;              sleep 2;              $LocalCopy++;              $GlobalVariable = $LocalCopy;              $semaphore->up;          }      }     The three invocations of the subroutine all operate in sync. The semaphore, though, makes sure that only one thread is accessing the global variable at once.   Advanced Semaphores    By default, semaphores behave like locks, letting only one thread  down()  them at a time. However, there are other uses for semaphores.    Each semaphore has a counter attached to it.  down()  decrements the counter and  up()  increments the counter. By default, semaphores are created with the counter set to one,  down()  decrements by one, and  up()  increments by one. If  down()  attempts to decrement the counter below zero, it blocks until the counter is large enough. Note that while a semaphore can be created with a starting count of zero, any  up()  or  down()  always changes the counter by at least one. $semaphore->down(0) is the same as $semaphore->down(1).    The question, of course, is why would you do something like this? Why create a semaphore with a starting count that's not one, or why decrement/increment it by more than one? The answer is resource availability. Many resources that you want to manage access for can be safely used by more than one thread at once.    For example, let's take a GUI driven program. It has a semaphore that it uses to synchronize access to the display, so only one thread is ever drawing at once. Handy, but of course you don't want any thread to start drawing until things are properly set up. In this case, you can create a semaphore with a counter set to zero, and up it when things are ready for drawing.    Semaphores with counters greater than one are also useful for establishing quotas. Say, for example, that you have a number of threads that can do I/O at once. You don't want all the threads reading or writing at once though, since that can potentially swamp your I/O channels, or deplete your process' quota of filehandles. You can use a semaphore initialized to the number of concurrent I/O requests (or open files) that you want at any one time, and have your threads quietly block and unblock themselves.    Larger increments or decrements are handy in those cases where a thread needs to check out or return a number of resources at once.         Attributes: Restricting Access To Subroutines    In addition to synchronizing access to data or resources, you might find it useful to synchronize access to subroutines. You may be accessing a singular machine resource (perhaps a vector processor), or find it easier to serialize calls to a particular subroutine than to have a set of locks and sempahores.    One of the additions to Perl 5.005 is subroutine attributes. The Thread package uses these to provide several flavors of serialization. It's important to remember that these attributes are used in the compilation phase of your program so you can't change a subroutine's behavior while your program is actually running.       Subroutine Locks    The basic subroutine lock looks like this:         sub test_sub {          use attrs qw(locked);      }     This ensures that only one thread will be executing this subroutine at any one time. Once a thread calls this subroutine, any other thread that calls it will block until the thread in the subroutine exits it. A more elaborate example looks like this:         use Thread qw(yield);           new Thread \&thread_sub, 1;      new Thread \&thread_sub, 2;      new Thread \&thread_sub, 3;      new Thread \&thread_sub, 4;          sub sync_sub {          use attrs qw(locked);          my $CallingThread = shift @_;          print ""In sync_sub for thread $CallingThread\n"";         yield;          sleep 3;          print ""Leaving sync_sub for thread $CallingThread\n"";      }          sub thread_sub {          my $ThreadID = shift @_;          print ""Thread $ThreadID calling sync_sub\n"";         sync_sub($ThreadID);          print ""$ThreadID is done with sync_sub\n"";      }     The use attrs  qw(locked)  locks  sync_sub(),  and if you run this, you can see that only one thread is in it at any one time.       Methods    Locking an entire subroutine can sometimes be overkill, especially when dealing with Perl objects. When calling a method for an object, for example, you want to serialize calls to a method, so that only one thread will be in the subroutine for a particular object, but threads calling that subroutine for a different object aren't blocked. The method attribute indicates whether the subroutine is really a method.         use Thread;          sub tester {          my $thrnum = shift @_;          my $bar = new Foo;          foreach (1..10) {                    print ""$thrnum calling per_object\n"";              $bar->per_object($thrnum);               print ""$thrnum out of per_object\n"";              yield;              print ""$thrnum calling one_at_a_time\n"";             $bar->one_at_a_time($thrnum);                    print ""$thrnum out of one_at_a_time\n"";              yield;          }      }          foreach my $thrnum (1..10) {          new Thread \&tester, $thrnum;      }          package Foo;      sub new {          my $class = shift @_;          return bless [@_], $class;      }          sub per_object {          use attrs qw(locked method);          my ($class, $thrnum) = @_;          print ""In per_object for thread $thrnum\n"";          yield;          sleep 2;          print ""Exiting per_object for thread $thrnum\n"";      }          sub one_at_a_time {          use attrs qw(locked);          my ($class, $thrnum) = @_;          print ""In one_at_a_time for thread $thrnum\n"";              yield;          sleep 2;          print ""Exiting one_at_a_time for thread $thrnum\n"";      }     As you can see from the output (omitted for brevity; it's 800 lines) all the threads can be in  per_object()  simultaneously, but only one thread is ever in  one_at_a_time()  at once.       Locking A Subroutine    You can lock a subroutine as you would lock a variable. Subroutine locks work the same as a  use attrs qw(locked)  in the subroutine, and block all access to the subroutine for other threads until the lock goes out of scope. When the subroutine isn't locked, any number of threads can be in it at once, and getting a lock on a subroutine doesn't affect threads already in the subroutine. Getting a lock on a subroutine looks like this:         lock(\&sub_to_lock);     Simple enough. Unlike use attrs, which is a compile time option, locking and unlocking a subroutine can be done at runtime at your discretion. There is some runtime penalty to using  lock(\&sub)  instead of use attrs  qw(locked),  so make sure you're choosing the proper method to do the locking.    You'd choose  lock(\&sub)  when writing modules and code to run on both threaded and unthreaded Perl, especially for code that will run on 5.004 or earlier Perls. In that case, it's useful to have subroutines that should be serialized lock themselves if they're running threaded, like so:         package Foo;      use Config;      $Running_Threaded = 0;          BEGIN { $Running_Threaded = $Config{'usethreads'} }          sub sub1 { lock(\&sub1) if $Running_Threaded }     This way you can ensure single-threadedness regardless of which version of Perl you're running.       General Thread Utility Routines    We've covered the workhorse parts of Perl's threading package, and with these tools you should be well on your way to writing threaded code and packages. There are a few useful little pieces that didn't really fit in anyplace else.       What Thread Am I In?    The Thread->self method provides your program with a way to get an object representing the thread it's currently in. You can use this object in the same way as the ones returned from the thread creation.       Thread IDs     tid()  is a thread object method that returns the thread ID of the thread the object represents. Thread IDs are integers, with the main thread in a program being 0. Currently Perl assigns a unique tid to every thread ever created in your program, assigning the first thread to be created a tid of 1, and increasing the tid by 1 for each new thread that's created.       Are These Threads The Same?    The  equal()  method takes two thread objects and returns true if the objects represent the same thread, and false if they don't.       What Threads Are Running?    Thread->list returns a list of thread objects, one for each thread that's currently running. Handy for a number of things, including cleaning up at the end of your program:         # Loop through all the threads      foreach $thr (Thread->list) {          # Don't join the main thread or ourselves          if ($thr->tid && !Thread::equal($thr, Thread->self)) {              $thr->join;          }      }     The example above is just for illustration. It isn't strictly necessary to join all the threads you create, since Perl detaches all the threads before it exits.       A Complete Example    Confused yet? It's time for an example program to show some of the things we've covered. This program finds prime numbers using threads.         1  #!/usr/bin/perl -w     2  # prime-pthread, courtesy of Tom Christiansen     3     4  use strict;     5     6  use Thread;     7  use Thread::Queue;     8     9  my $stream = new Thread::Queue;     10 my $kid    = new Thread(\&check_num, $stream, 2);     11     12 for my $i ( 3 .. 1000 ) {     13     $stream->enqueue($i);     14 }      15     16 $stream->enqueue(undef);     17 $kid->join();     18     19 sub check_num {     20     my ($upstream, $cur_prime) = @_;     21     my $kid;     22     my $downstream = new Thread::Queue;     23     while (my $num = $upstream->dequeue) {     24         next unless $num % $cur_prime;     25         if ($kid) {     26            $downstream->enqueue($num);     27                  } else {     28            print ""Found prime $num\n"";     29                $kid = new Thread(\&check_num, $downstream, $num);     30         }     31     }      32     $downstream->enqueue(undef) if $kid;     33     $kid->join()         if $kid;     34 }     This program uses the pipeline model to generate prime numbers. Each thread in the pipeline has an input queue that feeds numbers to be checked, a prime number that it's responsible for, and an output queue that it funnels numbers that have failed the check into. If the thread has a number that's failed its check and there's no child thread, then the thread must have found a new prime number. In that case, a new child thread is created for that prime and stuck on the end of the pipeline.    This probably sounds a bit more confusing than it really is, so lets go through this program piece by piece and see what it does. (For those of you who might be trying to remember exactly what a prime number is, it's a number that's only evenly divisible by itself and 1)    The bulk of the work is done by the  check_num()  subroutine, which takes a reference to its input queue and a prime number that it's responsible for. After pulling in the input queue and the prime that the subroutine's checking (line 20), we create a new queue (line 22) and reserve a scalar for the thread that we're likely to create later (line 21).    The while loop from lines 23 to line 31 grabs a scalar off the input queue and checks against the prime this thread is responsible for. Line 24 checks to see if there's a remainder when we modulo the number to be checked against our prime. If there is one, the number must not be evenly divisible by our prime, so we need to either pass it on to the next thread if we've created one (line 26) or create a new thread if we haven't.    The new thread creation is line 29. We pass on to it a reference to the queue we've created, and the prime number we've found.    Finally, once the loop terminates (because we got a 0 or undef in the queue, which serves as a note to die), we pass on the notice to our child and wait for it to exit if we've created a child (Lines 32 and 37).    Meanwhile, back in the main thread, we create a queue (line 9) and the initial child thread (line 10), and pre-seed it with the first prime: 2. Then we queue all the numbers from 3 to 1000 for checking (lines 12-14), then queue a die notice (line 16) and wait for the first child thread to terminate (line 17). Because a child won't die until its child has died, we know that we're done once we return from the join.    That's how it works. It's pretty simple; as with many Perl programs, the explanation is much longer than the program.       Conclusion    A complete thread tutorial could fill a book (and has, many times), but this should get you well on your way. The final authority on how Perl's threads behave is the documention bundled with the Perl distribution, but with what we've covered in this article, you should be well on your way to becoming a threaded Perl expert.

I'm currently looking at implementing some sort of anti-spam measures, one of which is to use bogofilter for all mail deliveries. This means I need to rebuild qmail with the qmailqueue patch and, while I'm at it, I thought I'd consider any other relevant patches.  So, is there a set of ""recommended"" patches that I should use?  Thanks for any suggestions and discussion.

Thanks. >>  In the words of Lyn Sapowsky-Smith:   ""I would take this discussion one step closer to home and present for discussion the assumption that most of those individuals who follow the spirit of the weasel are just as firm in their conviction of righteousness as those who follow the spirit of the eagle.  The differentiating factors everyone points out on this list is based on our own individual standard of what is morally acceptable.  Of course there are those individuals who consciously know their actions violate the integrity of this organization and 'service before self' only applies to other people.  It takes a lot of courage to stand up for what one believes in amidst a large number of people who would rather 'go along to get along' or (as one cadet recently expressed) 'suffer in silence'.  These are the moral obstacles which prevent the organization from ever reaching its potential.  Our organizational Bylaws and regulations are *supposed* to be the standard by which we *all* operate, but if we don't stand up against minor violations, we are doomed to suffer major violations.  That is where, I believe we should begin to turn things around, at the very first breech of order.  The first time we observe a minor violation, by either cadet or senior member, we should speak out and put that perpetrator on notice that violations are not acceptable.  If this action were taken today, right now, by every single member, it would do more to strengthen the organizational structure than any act of Congress will ever do.""  She said it better than I can, however I shall try to simplify for simple  minds.  As long as CAP is in the business of teaching our kids morality  through our programs and our actions, the discussion is relevant.  Thus, I  prefer that it stay on-list.    Matt, please note that we have changed the subject line to ""morality"" (except  this message) so from here on out, you can simply delete the messages on this  topic unread, as is your privilege.

System:  DEC Alpha 500/333.   Operating Sys: OSF1 V4.0b (revision 564)  Firmware: 6.4  I have physically installed the card. 'show config' recognizes both net cards, the original at:  BUS 00 slot 06: DECchip 21040 Network controller ewa0.0.0.6.0 and the new one at:  BUS 00 slot 12: DE500-BA Network controller ewb.0.0.0.12.0  The card, lights-up the '100 Mb/s orange LED' and the 'Link status LED' blinks - as if it has traffic. But no net activity on the machine...  I have correctly performed the kernel rebuild procedure,  (I know I did it right, because I also added a second SCSI controller at the same time and the system picked it up immediately) but the DE500-BA was not detected and nowhere to be found in the temprary kernel. Upon boot-up no indication of a 'tu1'. Only 'tu0' appears.  Has anyone seen this? Is there a patch or a firmware upgrade I need to do to get the card to be recognized by genvmunix? Should I just manually add the entry:  controller      tu1        at pci0      slot  12  in the kernel (/sys/conf/<SYSNAME>) and rebuild?   Following I have included my kernel file section. Any help will be appreciated. I will summarize.

I feel that while ALL of the problems at National are caused by the  ""leadership"" the corporation has had for the last xx years, the solution  will not be quickly or easily solved by implementing the changes you  propose, or by replacing the HWIC (head weasel in charge).  The pandering  to the HWIC that has been going on by the LW's (lesser weasels) is such  that only drastic surgery (decapitation) will suffice to fix it.  Moving  some of the weasels at various levels around (up from SER ""leadership"",  back down to SER staff, ring-around-the-maypole, etc) won't suffice.  Only  a drastic change in EVERYTHING will suffice, from the sponsoring AF  organization to the brand of coffee served in the break room.  The bad  actions and bad actors at the corporate headquarters are a cancer - the  only way to not be killed by it is to poison it to death (without killing  the patient) or by cutting it out (ditto).    Those employees that are in the organization for the organization will  remain valuable.  Those that are in so they can weasel around and get by on  CAP salary (plus retirement pay) most likely won't move.  With more and  better people to choose from to be employees, we will have a better staff.

We can do  our SAR missions, AE, the cadet programs, and at the very least have no  more difficulty than we do now with AU and AETC.            REPLY:  What John Kilgalon originally suggested was that we first  identify  the things which are broke and then suggest how to fix them.  While I quite  agree that CAP should no longer be under the AU, it is for a different  reason.            The ""broke"" things which most reduce the vitality of CAP are:    1.  the ""corporate or military"" identity crisis (which underlies the ""cadet  program or emergency services"" identity crisis)    2.  the appointment as officers of persons who would not qualify or barely  qualify for enlistment in the real military    3.   the utter insufficiency of the training program in subject matter,  amount and qualiity of material and educational level at which conducted,  and the lack of testing and quality control in even the minimal training  program which exists    4.  the lack of higher level management training after proficiency is  reached in the specialty tracks    6.  the lack of meaningful training for command and of a coherent command  selection system, instead of the the capricious method of appointing  commanders at the whimsy of the next senior commander    7.  the lack of a strong NCO corps to administer the day-to-day functions  which support programs and operations to free commanders and managers for  proactive planning instead of reactive planning    8.  the lack of a coherent justice code by which everyone can know the  rules, with a just system of administering disciplinary actions instead of  the whimsical and arbitrary hodge-podge of regulations now in place    9.  the lack of integrity which has been fostered by ""cheap"" officer rank,  non-existent honor standards (""officership""), political promotions to  secure support in National Board politics, etc.    10.  the lack of control of the BoG over the corporate officers (the BoG  should select, appoint, discipline and even dismiss the National Commander  and every national-level officer)            As to #10, my opinion is that the NC and all national level officers  should be like EMPLOYEES, selected by and accountable to the BoG.  There  should be ONE representative of the command structure ELECTED to the BoG by  the National Board.            CAP needs to be under the Homeland Command, just as it was originally  under the Office of Civil Defense.  We CAN play a vital role, but it won't  happen until the ""real"" homeland defenders see us clean up our own house.

It is sufficient to open a file (actually, this should work even if it's opened read-only), link to it or unlink it, fsync the file descriptor, and close.

REPLY:  I quite agree that we need to rid CAP of some particular people - and I don't mean by a gold watch and retriement party full of flatulence about how wonderful Weasel Joe was for CAP.  We need to ensure the members who stay that the word ""accountability"" really means something to the BoG.   OTOH, I don't believe we can just make a wholesale slaughter, like the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.  Certain people need to be removed from office, but not necessarily tossed out of CAP.  Some need to be removed from office and their misconduct documented, so that no one will ever put them in charge of anything again.  Still others need to be removed from office and demoted, their misconduct documented, but with the opportunity to rehabilitate themselves if they wish.  Still others need to be removed from office, solely on the BoG's discretion to choose who shall lead the reformed CAP.   And while I have harped and harped on implementing CAPJC, I believe there is legal justification for using the termination, non-renewal, and demotion regs which were in effect at the time of the Weasel misconduct to determine their future in CAP.   Have you noticed that a large segment of the Weasel Empire now resides in the National Excutive Committee?  That body was originally supposed to be an arm of the National Board, a smaller body which could respond promptly to circumstances arising between meetings of the larger (somewhat unwieldy) NB.  In reality, the NEC has become the NC's gestapo, enforcing a reign in which WC's are literally afraid to question or challenge the royal edicts from on high.  Now that all corporate powers have been vested in the BoG by congress, there is no need whatsoever for an ""executive committee"" of the NB.  Abolishing the NEC would be one giant leap for reforming CAP (apologies to Neil Armstrong).   Most of all, we cannot conduct the ""new CAP"" the same way the Weasels did. Misconduct need not be proven ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" (the criminal court standard) but only to the ""reasoned judgment"" of the convening authority"" (the UCMJ Article 32 standard).  In this matter, the convening authority ought to be the BoG.

Years ago, when CAP had  an aircraft in the Memphis Area, we did Sunset Safety Patrols and were tied in with the CG.   The CG was involved in rescues and environamental patrols. There is also heavy barge traffic on the Mighty Miss. When they break loose from the tugs and go downstream they pose a danger to the bridges. The bridges have been closed till they made detailed inspections of the damage from barge strikes.   Later after CAP had a MOU with CG, we had an arrangement with the CG to fly flights for them at our expense; river safety and environmental flights that were squashed by Wing. No explanation except Insurance wouldn't cover it. Years before Bowling we were applauded for it.  I checked two weeks ago and the CG is interested in setting up an Air for the CG Aux in this area now. A few years ago they were interested in working with CAP.    I believe CAP is making a mistake not tying in with the CG in places they can.    Tom R.                      Prev by Date:  AFAux Vs.

PAL and NTSC are miles away from being able to resolve that, let alone PAL/NTSC after subsampling and compressing by H.261/whatever.  However, almost all visualizers have a zoom function and with that you can usually zoom in until the text is legible, but the lines may then be too long to fit across the screen!  As ever, the slides would have to be prepared with the medium (in this case resampled video) in mind.  We use Elmo visualizers (xxx-5500) which are XGA (1024x768) native resolution cameras, and have an XGA (15 pin) output. With the right card, you could continuously capture that into the capture machine, and then use VNC on the resulting image to get a pixel-for-pixel copy out to others, but I don't know anyone who has tried it.  That would give you some serious resolution, albeit that VNC would give you a slowish update date, but it would settle (after the handwriting had stopped) quite quickly.
