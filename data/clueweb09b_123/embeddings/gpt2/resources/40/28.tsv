The origin of the Korean language is as obscure as the origins of the Korean people.  In the 19th century when Western scholars ""discovered"" the Korean language, from what family of languages the Korean language derived was one of the first questions posed about the language. These scholars proposed various theories linking the Korean language with Ural-Altaic, Japanese, Chinese, Tibetan, Dravidian Ainu, Indo-European and other languages.  Among these theories, only the relationship between Korean and Altaic (which groups the Turkic, Mongolian and Manchu-Tungus languages) and the relationship between Korean and Japanese have continuously attracted the attention of comparative linguists in the 20th century.   Altaic, Korean and Japanese not only exhibit similarities in their general structure, but also share common features such as vowel harmony and lack of conjunctions, although the vowel harmony in old Japanese has been the object of dispute among specialists in the field. Moreover, it has been found that these languages have various common elements in their grammar and vocabulary.  Although much work remains to be done, research seems to show that Korean is probably related to both Altaic and Japanese.   Back to top             HISTORY   According to early historical records, two groups of languages were spoken in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula at the dawn of the Christian era: one belonged to the Northern Puyo group and the other to the Southern Han group.  Around the middle of the seventh century when the kingdom of Shilla unified the peninsula, its language became the dominant form of communication.  As a result, the linguistic unification of the peninsula was achieved on the basis of the Shilla language.   When the Koryo Dynasty was founded in the 10th century, the capital was moved to Kaesong, located at the center of the Korean Peninsula.  From that time onward, the dialect of Kaesong became the standard national language.  After the Choson Dynasty was founded at the end of the 14th century, the capital was moved to Seoul.  However, since Seoul is geographically close to Kaesong, the move had little significant effect on the development of the language.     Back to top             SCRIPT   The Korean script which is now generally called  Han-gul  was invented in 1443 under the reign of Hing Sejong (r. 1418-1450), the fourth king of the Choson Dynasty.  It was then called  Hunmin Chong-um , or proper sounds to instruct the people.  However, evidence for a script version did not appear until 1446 when  Hunmin Chong-um  appeared in a written document.  The motivation behind the invention of the Korean script, according to King Sejong's preface to the above book, was to enable the Korean people to write their own language without the use of Chinese characters.  Until the introduction of  Hunmin Chong-um , Chinese characters were used by the upper classes, and Idu letters, a kind of Chinese-based Korean character system, were used by the populace.  There also seems to have been a second motivation behind the development of Korean script: to represent the ""proper"" sound associated with each Chinese character.   In attempting to invent a Korean writing system, King Sejong and the scholars who assisted him probably looked to several writing systems known to them at the time, such as Chinese old seal characters, the Uighur script and the Mongolian scripts.  The system that they came up with, however, is predominantly based upon their phonological studies.  Above all, they developed a theory of tripartite division of the syllable into initial, medial and final, as opposed to the bipartite division of traditional Chinese phonology.   The initial sounds (consonants) are represented by 17 letters of which there are five basic forms.  The other initial letters were derived by adding strokes to the basic letters.  No letters were invented for the final sounds, the initial letters being used for that purpose.  The original  Humin Chong-um  text also explains that the medial sounds (vowels) are represented by 11 letters of which there are three basic forms.    After the promulgation of the Korean alphabet, its popularity gradually increased, particularly in modern times, to the point where it has replaced Chinese characters as the primary writing system altogether.    One of the more interesting characteristics of the Korean script is its syllabic grouping of the initial, medial and final letters.  However, the Korean script is essentially different from such syllabic writing systems as Japanese Kana.  It is an alphabetic system which is characterized by syllabic grouping.    Back to top               Standard Language and Orthography    Modern Korean is divided into six dialects: Central, Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Cheju.  Except for the Cheju dialect, these are similar enough for speakers of the various dialects to communicate.  This is due to the fact that Korea has been a centralized state for more than a thousand years.  The language of the capital exercised a steady influence on the language spoken throughout the country.    The language of the capital was established as the basis for modern standard Korea in 1936, as a result of the deliberations of a committee organized by the Korean Language Research Society.  The language of the political and cultural center of a nation usually becomes standard language for the entire population.  In Korea, however, he case was somewhat different, since the guidelines for the national language standard were set forth by a small but dedicated group of scholars who had worked during the Japanese occupation.  They endeavored to preserve their own language in the face of an oppressive regime which had sought the eventual extinction of the Korean language.    Modern orthography was also determined by this same Korean Language Research Society in 1933.  In this way, Korean orthography, rather than being a product of a gradual process of natural selection, was deliberately manufactured.  Whereas 15th century orthography had been based on a phonemic principle, which each letter representing one phoneme, modern Korean orthography operates on a morphophonemic principle.  That is, while a morpheme, or a minimum meaningful unit, may be realized differently according to its context, its orthographic representation is a single base form.    Back to top               Phonology    The Korean language possesses a rich variety of vowels and consonants with nine simple vowels and three series of stops and affricates: plain, aspirated, and glottalized.  These  variations make it difficult for foreigners to lean and pronounce the language.  They also complicate the task of Romanization.    Phonemes of the plain stop series are realized as unvoiced sounds in the world-initial position, voiced sounds in the intervocalic position and unreleased sounds in the word-final position, e.g.  kap (kap)  ""case or small box"" and  kap-e  "" (kabe) in the case."" The liquid phoneme is realized as ""r"" in the intervocalic position and ""l"" in the word-final position.  For example,  tar  (tal) ""moon"" and  tar-e  (tare) ""at the moon.""    Another characteristic of modern Korean is that there are no consonant clusters or liquid sounds in the word-initial position.  As a result, Koreans pronounce the English word ""stop"" in two syllables, as (swt'op), and change the initial ""l"" or ""r"" in foreign words to ""n.""  Recently, however, there has been a tendency to pronounce initial liquid sounds in Western loan words.    Back to top               The Korean Alphabet    Korean is similar to the Altaic languages in that it possesses vowel harmony.  Evidence that vowel harmony was rigidly observed in old Korean, but rules have been significantly weakened in modern Korean.  Vowel harmony nevertheless continues to play an important role in the onomatopoetic and mimetic words so abundant in the language.    Back to top               Romanization   Korean is a difficult language to Romanize, given the variety of vowel and consonant phonemes and the complex rules for their realization.  of the Romanization systems that have been used since the 19th century, the most widely accepted have been the McCume-Reischauer System (1939), and the Ministry of Education System (1959).  The former has been used mainly in the United States and other Western countries, while the latter has been used in Korea.  In 1984, however, the Korean system was revised along the lines of the McCune-Reischauer System, with a few modifications, so that the two systems most widely used in Korean and the West are now, in effect, the same.   The system is a phonetic one, designed to faithfully represent modern Korean pronunciation with the Latin alphabet.  Under this system, a single phoneme of Korean may be represented by more than one Latin letter, depending on how the Korean phoneme is realized in a given context.  As explained above, plain stops and affricates in modern Korea are pronounced as either unvoiced or voiced sounds, and the liquid ""r"" and ""l,"" depending on the context.  The 1984 Romanization system reflects these variations.   Back to top             Vocabulary   The vocabulary of the Korean language is composed of indigenous words and loanwords, the latter being the result of contacts with other languages.  The majority of the loanwords are of Chinese origin, often called Sino-Korean words, a reflection of several millennia of Chinese cultural influence on Korea.  In modern Korean, native words are significantly outnumbered by Sino-Korean words.  As a result, a dual system of native and Sino-Korean words pervades the Korean lexicon, including two sets of native numbers are used with the  shi  (the house, i.e.  ahop shi , ""nine o'clock"") but Sino-Korean numerals are used with  pun  (the minute, i.e.  ka pun , ""nine minutes"").  The process of modernization has resulted in a steady flow of Western words entering the Korean language.  Technological and scientific terms represent the majority of these loanwords, although Western terms have been introduced into almost every field.

The origin of the Korean language is as obscure as the origins of the Korean people.  In the 19th century when Western scholars ""discovered"" the Korean language, from what family of languages the Korean language derived was one of the first questions posed about the language. These scholars proposed various theories linking the Korean language with Ural-Altaic, Japanese, Chinese, Tibetan, Dravidian Ainu, Indo-European and other languages.  Among these theories, only the relationship between Korean and Altaic (which groups the Turkic, Mongolian and Manchu-Tungus languages) and the relationship between Korean and Japanese have continuously attracted the attention of comparative linguists in the 20th century.   Altaic, Korean and Japanese not only exhibit similarities in their general structure, but also share common features such as vowel harmony and lack of conjunctions, although the vowel harmony in old Japanese has been the object of dispute among specialists in the field. Moreover, it has been found that these languages have various common elements in their grammar and vocabulary.  Although much work remains to be done, research seems to show that Korean is probably related to both Altaic and Japanese.   Back to top             HISTORY   According to early historical records, two groups of languages were spoken in Manchuria and on the Korean Peninsula at the dawn of the Christian era: one belonged to the Northern Puyo group and the other to the Southern Han group.  Around the middle of the seventh century when the kingdom of Shilla unified the peninsula, its language became the dominant form of communication.  As a result, the linguistic unification of the peninsula was achieved on the basis of the Shilla language.   When the Koryo Dynasty was founded in the 10th century, the capital was moved to Kaesong, located at the center of the Korean Peninsula.  From that time onward, the dialect of Kaesong became the standard national language.  After the Choson Dynasty was founded at the end of the 14th century, the capital was moved to Seoul.  However, since Seoul is geographically close to Kaesong, the move had little significant effect on the development of the language.     Back to top             SCRIPT   The Korean script which is now generally called  Han-gul  was invented in 1443 under the reign of Hing Sejong (r. 1418-1450), the fourth king of the Choson Dynasty.  It was then called  Hunmin Chong-um , or proper sounds to instruct the people.  However, evidence for a script version did not appear until 1446 when  Hunmin Chong-um  appeared in a written document.  The motivation behind the invention of the Korean script, according to King Sejong's preface to the above book, was to enable the Korean people to write their own language without the use of Chinese characters.  Until the introduction of  Hunmin Chong-um , Chinese characters were used by the upper classes, and Idu letters, a kind of Chinese-based Korean character system, were used by the populace.  There also seems to have been a second motivation behind the development of Korean script: to represent the ""proper"" sound associated with each Chinese character.   In attempting to invent a Korean writing system, King Sejong and the scholars who assisted him probably looked to several writing systems known to them at the time, such as Chinese old seal characters, the Uighur script and the Mongolian scripts.  The system that they came up with, however, is predominantly based upon their phonological studies.  Above all, they developed a theory of tripartite division of the syllable into initial, medial and final, as opposed to the bipartite division of traditional Chinese phonology.   The initial sounds (consonants) are represented by 17 letters of which there are five basic forms.  The other initial letters were derived by adding strokes to the basic letters.  No letters were invented for the final sounds, the initial letters being used for that purpose.  The original  Humin Chong-um  text also explains that the medial sounds (vowels) are represented by 11 letters of which there are three basic forms.    After the promulgation of the Korean alphabet, its popularity gradually increased, particularly in modern times, to the point where it has replaced Chinese characters as the primary writing system altogether.    One of the more interesting characteristics of the Korean script is its syllabic grouping of the initial, medial and final letters.  However, the Korean script is essentially different from such syllabic writing systems as Japanese Kana.  It is an alphabetic system which is characterized by syllabic grouping.    Back to top               Standard Language and Orthography    Modern Korean is divided into six dialects: Central, Northwest, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest and Cheju.  Except for the Cheju dialect, these are similar enough for speakers of the various dialects to communicate.  This is due to the fact that Korea has been a centralized state for more than a thousand years.  The language of the capital exercised a steady influence on the language spoken throughout the country.    The language of the capital was established as the basis for modern standard Korea in 1936, as a result of the deliberations of a committee organized by the Korean Language Research Society.  The language of the political and cultural center of a nation usually becomes standard language for the entire population.  In Korea, however, he case was somewhat different, since the guidelines for the national language standard were set forth by a small but dedicated group of scholars who had worked during the Japanese occupation.  They endeavored to preserve their own language in the face of an oppressive regime which had sought the eventual extinction of the Korean language.    Modern orthography was also determined by this same Korean Language Research Society in 1933.  In this way, Korean orthography, rather than being a product of a gradual process of natural selection, was deliberately manufactured.  Whereas 15th century orthography had been based on a phonemic principle, which each letter representing one phoneme, modern Korean orthography operates on a morphophonemic principle.  That is, while a morpheme, or a minimum meaningful unit, may be realized differently according to its context, its orthographic representation is a single base form.    Back to top               Phonology    The Korean language possesses a rich variety of vowels and consonants with nine simple vowels and three series of stops and affricates: plain, aspirated, and glottalized.  These  variations make it difficult for foreigners to lean and pronounce the language.  They also complicate the task of Romanization.    Phonemes of the plain stop series are realized as unvoiced sounds in the world-initial position, voiced sounds in the intervocalic position and unreleased sounds in the word-final position, e.g.  kap (kap)  ""case or small box"" and  kap-e  "" (kabe) in the case."" The liquid phoneme is realized as ""r"" in the intervocalic position and ""l"" in the word-final position.  For example,  tar  (tal) ""moon"" and  tar-e  (tare) ""at the moon.""    Another characteristic of modern Korean is that there are no consonant clusters or liquid sounds in the word-initial position.  As a result, Koreans pronounce the English word ""stop"" in two syllables, as (swt'op), and change the initial ""l"" or ""r"" in foreign words to ""n.""  Recently, however, there has been a tendency to pronounce initial liquid sounds in Western loan words.    Back to top               The Korean Alphabet    Korean is similar to the Altaic languages in that it possesses vowel harmony.  Evidence that vowel harmony was rigidly observed in old Korean, but rules have been significantly weakened in modern Korean.  Vowel harmony nevertheless continues to play an important role in the onomatopoetic and mimetic words so abundant in the language.    Back to top               Romanization   Korean is a difficult language to Romanize, given the variety of vowel and consonant phonemes and the complex rules for their realization.  of the Romanization systems that have been used since the 19th century, the most widely accepted have been the McCume-Reischauer System (1939), and the Ministry of Education System (1959).  The former has been used mainly in the United States and other Western countries, while the latter has been used in Korea.  In 1984, however, the Korean system was revised along the lines of the McCune-Reischauer System, with a few modifications, so that the two systems most widely used in Korean and the West are now, in effect, the same.   The system is a phonetic one, designed to faithfully represent modern Korean pronunciation with the Latin alphabet.  Under this system, a single phoneme of Korean may be represented by more than one Latin letter, depending on how the Korean phoneme is realized in a given context.  As explained above, plain stops and affricates in modern Korea are pronounced as either unvoiced or voiced sounds, and the liquid ""r"" and ""l,"" depending on the context.  The 1984 Romanization system reflects these variations.   Back to top             Vocabulary   The vocabulary of the Korean language is composed of indigenous words and loanwords, the latter being the result of contacts with other languages.  The majority of the loanwords are of Chinese origin, often called Sino-Korean words, a reflection of several millennia of Chinese cultural influence on Korea.  In modern Korean, native words are significantly outnumbered by Sino-Korean words.  As a result, a dual system of native and Sino-Korean words pervades the Korean lexicon, including two sets of native numbers are used with the  shi  (the house, i.e.  ahop shi , ""nine o'clock"") but Sino-Korean numerals are used with  pun  (the minute, i.e.  ka pun , ""nine minutes"").  The process of modernization has resulted in a steady flow of Western words entering the Korean language.  Technological and scientific terms represent the majority of these loanwords, although Western terms have been introduced into almost every field.

Learning         languages  |  Choosing your language  |  Francois Micheloud                                     This review is the kind contribution of  Mark       Bailey  from Japan                                 Korean                     /b>                           Speaking Korean offers you social and business         opportunities in the region, but the increasing number of Koreans who are studying English         sometimes makes it hard to practice unless you go to the suburbs or rural areas of South         Korea.          Compared to other Asian languages of the Northeast Asia region (Japanese, Mandarin,         Cantonese), this is the easiest to learn, due to the comparatively simple and logical         script, the absence of tones, and the large number of borrowed English words.                            Introduction          - ww.micheloud.com                           Usefulness                      definition           Speaking Korean is         of course advantageous primarily only if traveling or living in Korea, but ability to read         it will sometimes allow you to get cheaper prices in Korean shops in the country and in         Korean-owned shops in the US. Speaking it can also get you free extra or generous         portions of food from pleasantly surprised cooks in Korean restaurants, especially if the         restaurant is in another country, such as Japan, Canada, or in most large cities in the         U.S.                             Beauty                      Definition...           If you are used to         Romance languages, Korean may not seem so beautiful, sometimes described as choppy by         westerners and can sometimes sound angry to Japanese or Thai speakers, but there is an         elegance to the sound of the spoken language which is fun and challenging to get         accustomed to.                            Chic factor                      Definition...           Since Asian         languages are all considered to be difficult by most non-speakers, saying you speak Korean         has some chic appeal, especially if you are not of Korean descent. The fact that you         attempted to tackle a language so different from English or any western tongue will gain         you respect in most circles, especially in the U.S.                            Speakers                      Definition...           71 million                            Countries                      Definition...           Total Countries:         South Korea, North Korea, and sizeable communities in Japan, Canada, and the U.S.                            Regional variations                      Definition...           The dialects of         North Korea (Joson) and South Korea (Hanguk) are gradually gaining differences between         each other, mainly in spelling of vocabulary words, but are still mutually         intelligible. The writing system in North Korea has completely eliminated older         Chinese characters from writings, but in South Korea, you may still occasionally find some         in older literature. This is not much of a problem though because South Koreans use these         characters less and less, especially the younger generations. If you learn Korean, I         highly recommend the standard Seoul dialect of South Korea, which is the most prestigious         dialect and is easily understood among Korean speakers throughout the world.                             Travel                      Definition...           Since North Korea is         still very restricted for foreigners to travel to, South Korea is presently the only place         you can use it to travel, but the people will open up more to you if you speak their         language, especially the further you get from Seoul, the capital.                           Culture                      Definition...           If you are a         westerner, learning Korean (as with many Asian languages) will both require and allow you         to expand your cultural horizons, including the way you think about life, as well as how         you interact socially with the native speakers of your target language. Culture in the         land of the morning calm offers traditions, poems, parables, and historical writings         dating back at least a thousand years. The Korean language also offers unique concepts         such as the reluctance to leave old hopes and memories behind, and some interesting         Buddhist-based proverbs. Korean culture also offers a lively nightlife of spicy food and         fun bars and discos.                                       m                             Difficulty  - ww.micheloud.com                           Phonemes                      Definition...           No tones and not         many stressed syllables, but the consonants sometimes change sounds at the ends of words,         eliding into the next word. This takes getting used to, but is made up for in the         relatively easy syntax.The sounds are not particularly difficult to pronounce but are         different from western values, especially the consonants.(see Orthography below).                             Syntax                      Definition...           Verbs do not change         according to person or plural, but do have various degrees of politeness forms according         to the age and seniority of the person being addressed, which are difficult to master, but         fortunately the younger generations do not regularly use these so much, and you as a         foreigner will be forgiven for politeness mistakes, especially if you err on the side of         the standard text-book ?eimnida?f forms.                            Vocabulary                      Definition...           An easy aspect is         that many English words are easily recognizable: taxi, whiskey, ice cream, hotel, etc. The         more difficult aspect is that unless you know Chinese or Japanese, the non-borrowed Korean         words will seem long and unrelated to other languages. Learning numbers requires that         you learn two sets of Korean numbers and know when to use them, although one set is         derived from Chinese and will be easily recognizable to a Chinese, Japanese, or Thai         speaker.                            Orthograph                      Definition...           The more difficult         aspect for the beginner is the difference in sound values of b and p sounds, j and ch,and         t and d. This is compounded by the widely diverging romanization systems used for         Korean: Lukoff, Yale, Horne, and McCune-Reischauer. This confusion can be easily avoided         however if you learn the Korean script, Hangul, as soon as possible, and skip the middle         step of romanization completely.  This is strongly advised, because it will save         valuable time, lessen your confusion, and greatly enhance the speed with which you learn         Korean.   It will also help you to avoid spelling mistakes (there are two  T 's,         two  P 's, etc.in the script) when you start to write Korean Hangul         script.                            Overall difficulty                      Definition...           I rate this language         as DDD, rather difficult to learn for most westerners, but still one of the easiest of         northern Asian languages. Korean is not related to any other language or family, except         for Japanese, which it resembles slightly in structure, politeness rules, and borrowed         vocabulary. This fact makes it seem more difficult than it is. Knowing Chinese or Japanese         will make it easier to learn Korean, and like those languages, it is easier to speak it         than to read or write it.                             Time needed                      Definition...           I would allow a year         to learn to speak, but to learn to read newspapers and use the politeness forms properly         you would need at least three years of study, though you can learn to read simple Korean         in about four months. The right-angle shapes and logic of the writing system make it         easy to learn and can be learned in two days.  It is fun to show off that you can         read and write it but the tricky part comes in learning to read books and newspapers         quickly, which takes a lot of practice.                                       m                             Learning         material  - ww.micheloud.com                           Books and tapes                      Definition...           For an introduction         to only speaking Korean, I recommend the following:           Making Out in Korean, by Peter Constantine, 1995 Yenbooks (slightly racy terms included,         but very fun, trendy and colloquial).           Korean in Plain English, by Boye De Mente, Passport Books, 1988.           Korean in a Hurry, by Samuel E.Martin, Charles E. Tuttle Company           A formal and more comprehensive guide to learn to speak, write and read, I recommend:           Mastering Korean, by B.Nam Park, with cassettes, Barron's, 1988, this is the Foreign         Service Institute guide developed by the U.S.Government, and it is effective though dull         (no pictures or illustrations).           Also highly recommended are:           Colloquial Korean; A Complete Language Course, with cassettes, by A.I. Kim,         1997.           Korean: Instant Vocabulary, Vocabulearn, Levels I and II, 1986.           Pimsleur Language Program by Sung-Hyun Kirk Kim, 1998. Only 10 lessons are available         so far, but eventually the full 30-lesson package would be most beneficial.           If you can read Japanese, there is an excellent book with cassettes to teach vocabulary         and writing for beginners: Kankokugo Kihontango purasu 2000, by Kim Dong Hahn, Goken         Publishers.           In buying a dictionary, you have to decide if you want to get one that uses one of the         romanization systems listed above, which are confusing and incompatible with each         other. I strongly recommend instead that you learn the script and get a good Hangul         (script) dictionary, which may have pronunciation guides, but does not rely on a         romanization system.                             Schools                      Definition...           I am aware of a         school in Ohio, U.S. which teaches speaking, reading, and writing Korean: Korean         American Community School of Central Ohio:  http://www.kals.net/          The following program will set you up with a South Korean homestay family and enroll you         in Korean classes, but shop around in Seoul if you can, you may find a better bargain:         Languages Abroad, 502-99 Avenue Rd, Toronto, ON, Canada, M5R 2G5           Also these two programs will arrange for you to home-stay with Korean families, but do not         provide language classes:           ANDYOU Korean homestays  http://homestay1.andyou.com/cgi-bin/w3-msql/homestay.html            E-mail:  homestay@andyou.com             Ace Homestay  http://www.ace-homestay.com/            Many large U.S.cities feature some Korean programming on cable TV or radio, and the         internet and shortwave radio also provides Korean broadcasts.                            Links           Many large         U.S.cities feature some Korean programming on cable TV or radio, and the internet and         shortwave radio also provides Korean broadcasts. Go to  www.yahoo.co.kr   for a wide variety of Korean         links, including news and current events in South Korea. The Human Languages Page         offers some other good Korean language sites:  http://www.june29.com/HLP/                     To read the links for Korean on the internet, you will need a browser capable of reading         Hangul script, and will need Korean language support software if you want to type in         Korean.                                      Learning languages      |  Choosing your language  |  Francois     Micheloud                      
clueweb09-en0007-61-38988	"              Korean Studies at George Washington University    (January 24, 2006)    Young-Key Kim-Renaud, Ph.D. ,  Chair    Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures    Professor of Korean Language and Culture and International Affairs    The George Washington University    Washington, D. C. 20052    U.S.A.              1.    Introduction and Mission Statement    The George Washington University is located in the heart of Washington, D.C., just blocks from the White House, the World Bank, and the Kennedy Center. The National Mall is just a short walk away and houses, among other attractions, the world-renowned Asian collections of the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery. The Library of Congress, just a short Metro ride away, has some of the world's richest and most extensive collections of Asian materials. Washington is, of course, also home to numerous research institutions and non-profit organizations, many of which focus on Asian issues. All of these resources are easily accessible to students, faculty and visitors alike.     The rapid ascendance of Northeast Asia has made each country of the area a more distinct entity. Korea is now regarded as an integral and significant part of East Asia both from historical and contemporary points of view.    In particular, Korean culture and civilization is no longer considered a mere subset of the Chinese or Japanese for lack of direct knowledge, as was the case in the 1950s.    Historically, Korea, being in the heart of the Northeast Asia where Mahayana Buddhism and Confucianism flourished, has contributed to the development of the East-Asian culture and civilization.          Today,  Korea's strategic location and active participation in world economic, political, intellectual and cultural life as well as a significant number of diasporic Koreans living throughout the world have made the study of Korean language and culture a new subject of practical importance and worthy intellectual pursuit.  What happens in one  area of East Asia  affects scholars in the other areas.    In fact, as far as academic standards are concerned, no East Asian language and culture/literature department can be considered first-rate today if it does not include a Korean language program.    Experience shows that increases in one language offering seem to increase interest and ""traffic"" in all East Asian language offerings.         The George Washington University  (GWU)  is one of the institutions of higher learning that decided to strengthen their East Asian studies programs by  formally  including the Korean studies component  in the early 1980s .    However, GWUs relationship with Korea is long and significant.    Suh Jae-pil  (also known by his American name of  Philip Jaisohn ), a renowned leader in the fight for independence and modernization of Korea, graduated from Columbia Medical College (now GWUs School of Medicine  and Health Sciences ) in 1892, becoming the first Korean and one of the fist Asians to earn a Doctor of Medicine degree in the United States (Theodore T. Suh, http://www.ncneighbors.com/media/documents/261.6.doc). Syngman Rhee, the first President of the Republic of Korea, received his B.A. degree from GWU in 1907, a Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award in 1949, and an honorary degree (LL.D.) in 1954 (http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/archives/almanac/recip.html).  Roh Tae Woo , the 13 th   President of the Republic of Korea  (1988-1993 ),  received an honorary degree in  1989  ( http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/archives/collections/verticalfiles.html ). Executives of the largest Korean companies, such as Hyundai, Dae Woo and Samsung either studied at GWU, earned degrees, or were recipients of honorary degrees.          At program levels, various  parts of the University have established close relationships with the Republic of Korea  also .    Over the years, students   have come from Korea to  study  at  GWU.    GWU has been a favorite destination for many distinguished visiting scholars from Korea and others who are Korea specialists.  T he  GWU community  has been greatly enriched by their relationship with Korea and Korea  specialists .    Being in the center of the nations capital, where many different nationalities come together, GWU  has constantly emphasized international and cross-cultural  education .           One of the Elliott School's most recent initiatives has been the construction of a network of partnerships with other outstanding graduate programs in international affairs around the world.    The purpose of this network is to enable exchange of both graduate students and faculty.    The network now has more than a dozen partners, including the London School of Economics, Sciences Po  (Institut d'Etudes Politiques) in Paris , the Free University of Berlin, Waseda University, Fudan University, the National University of Singapore, the University of Sydney, and Hong Kong University. In Korea, GWs Elliott School has established a thriving joint degree program for a Master of International Studies (M.I.S.). with the Graduate School of International Studies of Ewha Womans University in Seoul ( http://www.gwu.edu/~elliott/academicprograms/studyabroad/Ewha.cfm ). This exchange relationship, which began in 2001 and was renewed in 2004, is part of a broader graduate student exchange program specifically with the Graduate School of International Studies at Ewha. Many students go for study in Korea for only a semester, although some indeed take the one-year dual degree program. They also have other exchange relationships with two other prestigious universities in Korea, Seoul National University and Yonsei University.         The Elliott Schools interest in Korea  and Korean affairs  goes beyond the walls of GWU and Universities with exchange relations. Various research centers within the Elliott School have individual connections with counterparts in Korea.    The Sigur Center for Asian Studies, in particular, has a strong relationship with various scholars and institutions of higher learning. In December 2005, the Sigur Center and Stanford Universitys Korean Studies Program signed with the POSCO TJ Park Foundation a Memorandum of Understanding for a POSCO NGO Fellowship Program to provide the opportunity for key personnel of Korean non-government organizations to spend time at leading North American universities gaining knowledge and experience that will further the development of NGOs in Korea.          The Center for International Studies at Yonsei University, and the Center for International Science and Technology Policy (CISTP) has a relationship with the Science, Technology, and Economic Policy Institute and the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Evaluation and Planning. Dr. Oh-Kab Kwon, Chairman and CEO of the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation, is an alumnus of the CISTPs M.A. program and currently serves as the President of the GW Alumni Association in the Republic of Korea, the largest GW alumni association outside of the U.S. The strong connection between CISTP and Korean organizations was further reaffirmed in 2005 by the appointment of Prof. Nick Vonortas, director of the Center and professor of economics and international affairs at GW, on the Board of Directors of the Korea-U.S. Science Cooperation Center, which promotes Korean research and development in cooperation with U.S. research institutions.          The Elliott Schools frequent talks, conferences, and other meetings  on Korea  are well attended.  Other colleges and professional schools have also  been interested in Korea,  as manifested in Professor Yoon-shik Parks activities in the financial sector noted above .         There are basically two complementary and mutually cooperating parts to Korean studies at GWU, one in the Korean humanities taught in the Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures (EALL) of the Columbian School of Arts and Sciences, concentrating on language, literature and culture, and the other in the social sciences with the study of history, anthropology, education, political science, business and economics, by various faculty affiliated with the Elliott School of International Affairs (ESIA). GWU is the only university in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, which has a degree program in a specifically Korean field, offering a minor in Korean language and literature.    More broadly, Korea is an integral part of t he Asian Studies Program , which  is a multidisciplinary undergraduate and graduate academic program within the Elliott School.    The Sigur Center for Asian Studies  (SCAS) , one of the Elliott Schools research and  support  centers, functions as the effective institutional department for the Asian Studies Program.         The  Asian Studies Program with a Korean emphasis (Korean  Studies Program hereinafter) shares a joint mission with  the  Sigur Center for Asian Studies to increase the quality and broaden the scope of scholarly research and publications on Asian affairs, promote U.S.-Asian scholarly interaction and serve as the nexus for educating a new generation of students, scholars, analysts, and policymakers prepared to deal with the rapidly expanding role of East Asia and the Pacific Rim in world affairs.         GW has one of the oldest international studies programs in the country, having been engaged in instruction in international affairs since 1898.    But the quality of our program has grown most rapidly since the establishment of a separate school of international affairs in 1987.    Three times in succession, GW has been awarded the status of a National Resource Center in International Studies by the U.S. Department of Education in the triennial competition.    During the most recent round of competition, in 2002-03, GW was the only university in the Washington area to receive such a grant.    It was also one of only eight universities in the United States to receive the full range of funding -- funds for both academic programs and graduate fellowships -- under this program.    This award confirms the quality of our teaching and research in international affairs, which is based on the combination of both area studies and functional studies into a single integrated program.    For our students we strive to offer an education which will change their lives by not only offering them special linguistic and cultural experiences but also by training them to function more wisely and competently in the increasingly globalizing world. The East Asian Languages and Literatures Department prepares students for significant careers in East-Asian affairs and related fields, by helping them develop leadership qualities through rigorous academic and practical training. Careers in East Asia related fields offer very diverse opportunities in a world in which Asia plays an increasingly important role. The students in our program go into government, diplomacy, business, academia, intelligence, medicine, and the legal profession, etc.    For our faculty, we endeavor to foster an atmosphere in which dynamic research and teaching projects can be carried out, to benefit each other as well as our students. Many of our faculty members count among the prominent scholars in East Asian studies. At the University level, the EALL Department works to complement and support the disciplinary study of East Asia in a number of different departments and programs in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and professional schools, including Anthropology, Art History, History, Linguistics, Philosophy, Religion, Political Science, Business, International Affairs, Law, and Women s Studies. The EALL Department also complements, while being its integral part, the Sigur Center for Asian Studies, which has recently been selected as one of seven areas of academic excellence by the University. The Sigur Center s main interest is in current affairs, but without knowledge of cultural and historical background of the region, a true understanding of the present is impossible.    The Korean studies program  also respond s  to the needs of the larger Washington, DC community. The  Hahn Moo-Sook Colloquium in the Korean Humanities series organized by EALL  for students, faculty members, and friends of GWU helps to promote  i nterdisciplinary and international dialog. The media—not only the mainstream ones such as Washington Post, NPR, News Channel 8, but also ethnic Asian print and broadcast media--often seek advice of our faculty members on  Korean and  East-Asian and Asian-American affairs.     The  Korean and East Asian programs  maintain close relations with the Freer-Sackler Galleries and  the  Asian Pacific American Program of the Smithsonian Institution, the world's largest museum complex, which are minutes away from  the  GWU  campus . We work closely also with the area s various research libraries and the Asian Division of the Library of Congress as well as with the East-Asian studies faculty in other universities in the area. Various embassies from East Asian countries  including Korea  and their cultural centers are frequent supporters or our academic and cultural activities.    Curators, visiting faculty, and advanced graduate students from all over the world that does research at those institutions could be and are invited to help with guest teaching here at GWU.     The Washington, D. C. metropolitan area is one of the most culturally diverse in the nation and one of the world's most cosmopolitan urban areas. Maryland and Northern Virginia have a large and growing population of people of  East-Asian  ancestry, including a very significant number of ethnic Koreans, Chinese and Vietnamese. The rapid growth of these Asian ethnic populations is increasingly reflected in GWU's enrollment figures. GWU, like few other educational institutions of higher learning in the United States, is strategically situated geographically and demographically to further the research and teaching of East Asian societies and cultures as well as their current affairs.    In what follows, we present the state of the Korean Language and Literature program, closely following the  GWU  Guidelines and Format for Self-Study Report.    We will specify our plans to continue our strength, while reviewing where some of the problems might have originated and how we may avoid them in the future. We also make a modest proposal for the way the EALL Department and the University could help to make the Korean component of the East Asian Languages and Literatures Department healthy and prosperous. In the Appendix, we will list GW courses on Asia and Korea-related topics.         2. A Brief History    The history  of the Asian Studies program at GWU  reflects the changes in the global  situation  since the early 1960s.    During the peak of the Cold War in the aftermath  of the Second World War, colleges and universities  in the United States realized that they  were miserably  lacking  in scholars  doing  research on  Eastern European and East-Asian countries, the majority of which belonged to the Communist block.    They were naturally   ill prepared  to educate their students and the public at large or to advise government leaders on policy toward these emerging regimes.     GWUs renowned  Institute for Sino-Soviet Studies was  thus born  in 1961  with the goal  to help fill  this gap  by promoting and supporting scholarly research, policy analysis and undergraduate and graduate-level teaching in Soviet, Central and East European and East Asian affairs.    It was under these circumstances that, in 1963, the first Chinese language courses were offered at GWU.    They were taught by Beverly Fincher out of the then Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures.    In 1965, a formal Chinese language program was established, still within the Slavic Department. An independent Department of East Asian Languages and Literatures was created as a part of the then School of Public and International Affairs, under the Chairship of Dr. Chung-Wen Shih in 1972, offering a full battery of Chinese language and literature courses.    Japanese language was added shortly thereafter.            Korean-language instruction at  GWU  began with two courses technically first offered  in the academic year of 1982-83, but actually  in the summer of 1983 , with six students enrolled.  At that time, GWU was the only university in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area , formally offering Korean language courses as part of its regular curriculum .    Since then, other universities in the area began offering Korean courses, too.    However, steady growth in the number of course offerings made GWUs Korean program the leader not only in this area but definitely one of the most comprehensive language programs in the world.    Only a small portion of the Korean language programs offer a four-year language education. The Korean program began to offer Korean literature courses during the academic year 1999-2000, and GWU is the only university in the area regularly offering Korean literature courses. These course s , first taught as an experimental  "

Korean is not closely related to any other language, though a distant genetic kinship to  Japanese  is now thought probable by some scholars, and an even more remote relationship to the  Altaic languages  is possible. Korean was written with  Chinese  characters to stand in various ways for Korean meanings and sounds as early as the 12th century, though substantial documentation is not evident until the invention of a unique phonetic script for it in 1443. This script, now called Hangul, represents syllables by arranging simple symbols for each  phoneme  into a square form like that of a Chinese character. Grammatically, Korean has a basic subject-object-verb word order and places modifiers before the elements they modify.

Korean  ( \m / p  , see  below ) is the official  language  of  North Korea  and  South Korea . It is also one of the two official languages in the  Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture  in  China . There are about 78 million Korean speakers, [ 1 ]  with large groups in  Australia ,  Brazil ,  Canada ,  China ,  Japan , the  United States ,  CIS  ( post-Soviet states ), and more recently the  Philippines . It was formerly written using  Hanja , borrowed  Chinese characters  pronounced in the Korean way. In the 15th century a national writing system was developed by  Sejong the Great , nowadays called  Hangul .   The genealogical  classification  of the Korean language is debated. Most linguists place it in the  Altaic  language family [ citation needed ] , while others consider it to be a  language isolate .

In South Korea, the language is most often called  Hangungmal  ( \m ;   ), or more formally,  Hangugeo  ( \m ;   ) or  Gugeo  ( m ;   ; literally ""national language"").   In North Korea and Yanbian in China, the language is most often called  ChosOnmal  ( p  ; with  hanja :   ), or more formally,  ChosOnO  ( p  ;   ).   On the other hand, Korean people in the  former USSR , who refer to themselves as  Koryo-saram  (also  Goryeoin  [ $x ;  ؗ ; literally, "" Goryeo  person(s)""]) call the language  Goryeomal  ( $ ;  ؗ ).   In  mainland China , following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term  Choxiny  (   or short form:  Choy  (  )) has normally been used to refer to the language spoken in North Korea and Yanbian, while  Hnguy  (   or short form:  Hny  (  )) is used to refer to the language spoken in South Korea.   Some older English sources also used the name ""Corean"" to refer to the language, country, and people.       History       Main article:  History of the Korean language       Korean is descended from  Old Korean  and  Middle Korean .       Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .   On the other hand, since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Northern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [ 2 ]   It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have nearly identical grammatical structures, and share a number of possible phonological cognates (though a majority of them are likely due to local pronunciations of the Chinese characters from which they are derived), as noted by such researchers as  Samuel E. Martin  and  Roy Andrew Miller  in the late 1960s.  Sergei Starostin  (1991) found about 25% of potential cognates in the Japanese-Korean 100-word  Swadesh list , which places these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family. [ 3 ]   Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter either through placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [ 4 ]   The possible relationship between Korean and Japanese can be exemplified by such basic vocabularly items as J.  4   mizu  (Old J.  midu ) : K.  <   mul  (Middle K.  mirh ) ""water"",  mot  ""lake""; J.  e   ku-ru  ""come"" (Old J.  ku , also cf. irregular root changes as in past tense e_  ki-ta , negative ejD  ko-nai  in Modern J.) : K.     ka-da  (""go""); J.  lD   kata-i  ""hard"" (whence    kata-na  ""knife, sword"") : K.  kud-yn  (hard); J.  D   i-ru  ""to be"" (past tense D_  i-ta ) : K.  t   i-da  ""to be""; J.  na ,  -en  : K.  anh  ""not"", J.  minna  (Old J.  mynna ) ""all, everyone"" : K.  manh-  ""many"" (predicate  mana-da ), etc.  [ 5 ] . The same possible cognates are often observed in other members of the potential  Altaic family , esp. in the  Tungusic languages . Cf. Nanay  mue  ""water"",  giagda-  ""to walk"",  anaa, anna  ""not"".   Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.   It is presumed that modern Korean may be more closely related to the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla  than the Buyeo languages; many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.   There are also more marginal hypotheses proposing various other relationships; for example, a few scholars, such as  Homer B. Hulbert  (1905), have tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [ 6 ]   Though not related to Chinese, it has borrowed heavily; see the Vocabulary section below.       Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects              Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yOngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju Island  (see  Jeju dialect ). The dialect spoken in Jeju is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use very little stress, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.   It is also worth noting that there is substantial evidence for a history of extensive  dialect levelling , or even  convergent evolution  or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean     /ip/  ""mouth"" or Gyeongsang dialect  /K.au.i/  vs. Standard Korean  /puШu/  "" garlic chives ."" This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. [ citation needed ]  See also the  Buyeo languages   hypothesis .   There is a very close connection between the dialects of Korean and the  regions of Korea , since the boundaries of both are largely determined by mountains and seas.

Official figures estimate that 27.5% [ 14 ]  of Indians lived below the national poverty line in 2004-2005. [ 15 ]  A 2007 report by the state-run National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganised Sector (NCEUS) found that 25% of Indians, or 236 million people, lived on less than 20 rupees per day [ 16 ]  with most working in ""informal labour sector with no job or social security, living in abject poverty."" [ 17 ]   Since the early 1950s, successive governments have implemented various schemes, under  planning , to alleviate poverty, that have met with partial success. Programmes like  Food for work  and  National Rural Employment Programme  have attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure. [ 18 ]  In August 2005, the  Indian parliament  passed the  Rural Employment Guarantee Bill , the largest programme of this type, in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to every rural household in 200 of  India's 600 districts . The question of whether economic reforms have reduced poverty or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put political pressure on further economic reforms, especially those involving downsizing of labour and cutting down agricultural subsidiary     [ edit ]   Physical infrastructure       Main articles:  Transport in India  and  Water supply and sanitation in India              Cheap and environment friendly  public transport  is seen as a necessity for India's crowded and polluted metros. Pictured here, is the  New Delhi Metro , operational since 2002 and seen as a model for other metros.       Since independence, India has allocated nearly half of the total outlay of the five-year plans for  infrastructural  development. Much of the total outlay was spent on large projects in the area of irrigation, energy, transport, communications and social overheads. Development of infrastructure was completely in the hands of the public sector and was plagued by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, urban-bias and an inability to scale investment. [ 19 ]   India's low spending on power, construction, transportation, telecommunications and  real estate , at $31 billion or 6% of GDP, compared to  China's  spending of $260 billion or 20% of its GDP in 2002 has prevented India from sustaining a growth rate of around 8%. This has prompted the government to partially open up infrastructure to the private sector allowing foreign investment. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 18 ]  India holds second position in the world in roadways' construction, more than twice that of China. [ 22 ]   As of  31 December   2005 , there were an estimated 835,000 broadband lines in India. [ 23 ]  Low tele-density is the major hurdle for slow pickup in broadband services. Over 76% of the broadband lines were via DSL and the rest via cable modems.   A 2007 study by the Asian Development Bank showed that in 20 cities the average duration of supply was only 4.3 hours per day. No city had continuous supply. The longest duration of supply was 12 hours per day in  Chandigarh , and the lowest was 0.3 hours per day in  Rajkot . [ 24 ]  Some 700 million Indians do not have access to a proper toilet. [ 25 ]  Open  defecation  is widespread even in urban areas of India. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Regional imbalance          Rural life in  Rajasthan .           Main article:  List of regions of India       One of the critical problems facing India's economy is the sharp and growing regional variations among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and socio-economic development. For instance, the difference in growth rate between the  forward and backward states  was 0.3% (5.2% & 4.9%) during 198081 to 199091, but had grown to 3.3% (6.3% & 3.0%) during 199091 to 199798. [ 28 ]   The five-year plans have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities. Even the industrial townships in the interiors,  Bhilai  for instance, resulted in very little development in the surrounding areas. [ 29 ]  After liberalisation, the disparities have grown despite the efforts of the union government in reducing them. Part of the reason being that manufacturing and services and not agriculture are the engines of growth. The more advanced states are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.

About 16 per cent of all the world's people live in India.  Only China, which has a population of more than one billion, has more people than India.  India is more densely populated than most other countries.    Vital statistics:   Population ('99 UN est.) : 998.1 million  Population (2025-projection) : 1,330.2 million  Sex ratio (female/1000 males) : 927  About 73 per cent of India's people live in rural areas.  Most of the country's 557,000 farm villages have less than 1,000 people.  About 27 per cent of the people live in urban areas.  India has about 4,000 cities and towns.  About 300 cities have populations over 100,000.  Six cities have more than 3 million people.  These cities, in order of population size, are Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai (Madras), and Hyderabad.  Calcutta, the capital city of West Bengal, has the greatest population density of any city in India, with an average of about 42,000 people per square kilometre.  Since the early 1900's, India's population has grown by several million a year.  During the 1980's and 1990's, the population increased by as much as 18 million per year.  The main reason for this ""population explosion"" is that improved sanitation and health care have caused the death rate to fall more rapidly than the birth rate.  Population growth has led to serious overcrowding. India's city population grows about twice as fast as the population of the country as a whole.    Ancestry .   India's people belong to a variety of ethnic groups.  The two largest groups are the light-skinned Indo-Aryans and the dark-skinned Dravidians.  Most Indo-Aryans live in northern India, and a majority of the Dravidians live in southern parts of the country.     The Dravidians were among India's earliest known inhabitants.  About 2500 B.C., they created an advanced civilization in the Indus Valley.  About 1500 B.C., the Aryans invaded the Indus Valley and drove the Dravidians south.     Beginning about A.D. 1000, central Asian Islamic peoples, mainly from the area that is now Afghanistan and Iran, settled in India.  Many of their descendants live in the northeast, especially in the states  of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.  Mongoloid peoples live in the Himalayan region along India's northeastern border and in the states that border Burma.  Most members of such minority groups as the Bhils, Gonds, Khasis, Nagas, Oraons, and Santals live in remote hills and forests.       Continue .......                Copyright ©2000  indiansaga.info .

Learning         languages  |  Choosing your language  |  Francois Micheloud                                     This review is the kind contribution of  Mark       Bailey  from Japan                                 Korean                     /b>                           Speaking Korean offers you social and business         opportunities in the region, but the increasing number of Koreans who are studying English         sometimes makes it hard to practice unless you go to the suburbs or rural areas of South         Korea.          Compared to other Asian languages of the Northeast Asia region (Japanese, Mandarin,         Cantonese), this is the easiest to learn, due to the comparatively simple and logical         script, the absence of tones, and the large number of borrowed English words.                            Introduction          - ww.micheloud.com                           Usefulness                      definition           Speaking Korean is         of course advantageous primarily only if traveling or living in Korea, but ability to read         it will sometimes allow you to get cheaper prices in Korean shops in the country and in         Korean-owned shops in the US. Speaking it can also get you free extra or generous         portions of food from pleasantly surprised cooks in Korean restaurants, especially if the         restaurant is in another country, such as Japan, Canada, or in most large cities in the         U.S.                             Beauty                      Definition...           If you are used to         Romance languages, Korean may not seem so beautiful, sometimes described as choppy by         westerners and can sometimes sound angry to Japanese or Thai speakers, but there is an         elegance to the sound of the spoken language which is fun and challenging to get         accustomed to.                            Chic factor                      Definition...           Since Asian         languages are all considered to be difficult by most non-speakers, saying you speak Korean         has some chic appeal, especially if you are not of Korean descent. The fact that you         attempted to tackle a language so different from English or any western tongue will gain         you respect in most circles, especially in the U.S.                            Speakers                      Definition...           71 million                            Countries                      Definition...           Total Countries:         South Korea, North Korea, and sizeable communities in Japan, Canada, and the U.S.                            Regional variations                      Definition...           The dialects of         North Korea (Joson) and South Korea (Hanguk) are gradually gaining differences between         each other, mainly in spelling of vocabulary words, but are still mutually         intelligible. The writing system in North Korea has completely eliminated older         Chinese characters from writings, but in South Korea, you may still occasionally find some         in older literature. This is not much of a problem though because South Koreans use these         characters less and less, especially the younger generations. If you learn Korean, I         highly recommend the standard Seoul dialect of South Korea, which is the most prestigious         dialect and is easily understood among Korean speakers throughout the world.                             Travel                      Definition...           Since North Korea is         still very restricted for foreigners to travel to, South Korea is presently the only place         you can use it to travel, but the people will open up more to you if you speak their         language, especially the further you get from Seoul, the capital.                           Culture                      Definition...           If you are a         westerner, learning Korean (as with many Asian languages) will both require and allow you         to expand your cultural horizons, including the way you think about life, as well as how         you interact socially with the native speakers of your target language. Culture in the         land of the morning calm offers traditions, poems, parables, and historical writings         dating back at least a thousand years. The Korean language also offers unique concepts         such as the reluctance to leave old hopes and memories behind, and some interesting         Buddhist-based proverbs. Korean culture also offers a lively nightlife of spicy food and         fun bars and discos.                                       m                             Difficulty  - ww.micheloud.com                           Phonemes                      Definition...           No tones and not         many stressed syllables, but the consonants sometimes change sounds at the ends of words,         eliding into the next word. This takes getting used to, but is made up for in the         relatively easy syntax.The sounds are not particularly difficult to pronounce but are         different from western values, especially the consonants.(see Orthography below).                             Syntax                      Definition...           Verbs do not change         according to person or plural, but do have various degrees of politeness forms according         to the age and seniority of the person being addressed, which are difficult to master, but         fortunately the younger generations do not regularly use these so much, and you as a         foreigner will be forgiven for politeness mistakes, especially if you err on the side of         the standard text-book ?eimnida?f forms.                            Vocabulary                      Definition...           An easy aspect is         that many English words are easily recognizable: taxi, whiskey, ice cream, hotel, etc. The         more difficult aspect is that unless you know Chinese or Japanese, the non-borrowed Korean         words will seem long and unrelated to other languages. Learning numbers requires that         you learn two sets of Korean numbers and know when to use them, although one set is         derived from Chinese and will be easily recognizable to a Chinese, Japanese, or Thai         speaker.                            Orthograph                      Definition...           The more difficult         aspect for the beginner is the difference in sound values of b and p sounds, j and ch,and         t and d. This is compounded by the widely diverging romanization systems used for         Korean: Lukoff, Yale, Horne, and McCune-Reischauer. This confusion can be easily avoided         however if you learn the Korean script, Hangul, as soon as possible, and skip the middle         step of romanization completely.  This is strongly advised, because it will save         valuable time, lessen your confusion, and greatly enhance the speed with which you learn         Korean.   It will also help you to avoid spelling mistakes (there are two  T 's,         two  P 's, etc.in the script) when you start to write Korean Hangul         script.                            Overall difficulty                      Definition...           I rate this language         as DDD, rather difficult to learn for most westerners, but still one of the easiest of         northern Asian languages. Korean is not related to any other language or family, except         for Japanese, which it resembles slightly in structure, politeness rules, and borrowed         vocabulary. This fact makes it seem more difficult than it is. Knowing Chinese or Japanese         will make it easier to learn Korean, and like those languages, it is easier to speak it         than to read or write it.                             Time needed                      Definition...           I would allow a year         to learn to speak, but to learn to read newspapers and use the politeness forms properly         you would need at least three years of study, though you can learn to read simple Korean         in about four months. The right-angle shapes and logic of the writing system make it         easy to learn and can be learned in two days.  It is fun to show off that you can         read and write it but the tricky part comes in learning to read books and newspapers         quickly, which takes a lot of practice.                                       m                             Learning         material  - ww.micheloud.com                           Books and tapes                      Definition...           For an introduction         to only speaking Korean, I recommend the following:           Making Out in Korean, by Peter Constantine, 1995 Yenbooks (slightly racy terms included,         but very fun, trendy and colloquial).           Korean in Plain English, by Boye De Mente, Passport Books, 1988.           Korean in a Hurry, by Samuel E.Martin, Charles E. Tuttle Company           A formal and more comprehensive guide to learn to speak, write and read, I recommend:           Mastering Korean, by B.Nam Park, with cassettes, Barron's, 1988, this is the Foreign         Service Institute guide developed by the U.S.Government, and it is effective though dull         (no pictures or illustrations).           Also highly recommended are:           Colloquial Korean; A Complete Language Course, with cassettes, by A.I. Kim,         1997.           Korean: Instant Vocabulary, Vocabulearn, Levels I and II, 1986.           Pimsleur Language Program by Sung-Hyun Kirk Kim, 1998. Only 10 lessons are available         so far, but eventually the full 30-lesson package would be most beneficial.           If you can read Japanese, there is an excellent book with cassettes to teach vocabulary         and writing for beginners: Kankokugo Kihontango purasu 2000, by Kim Dong Hahn, Goken         Publishers.           In buying a dictionary, you have to decide if you want to get one that uses one of the         romanization systems listed above, which are confusing and incompatible with each         other. I strongly recommend instead that you learn the script and get a good Hangul         (script) dictionary, which may have pronunciation guides, but does not rely on a         romanization system.                             Schools                      Definition...           I am aware of a         school in Ohio, U.S. which teaches speaking, reading, and writing Korean: Korean         American Community School of Central Ohio:  http://www.kals.net/          The following program will set you up with a South Korean homestay family and enroll you         in Korean classes, but shop around in Seoul if you can, you may find a better bargain:         Languages Abroad, 502-99 Avenue Rd, Toronto, ON, Canada, M5R 2G5           Also these two programs will arrange for you to home-stay with Korean families, but do not         provide language classes:           ANDYOU Korean homestays  http://homestay1.andyou.com/cgi-bin/w3-msql/homestay.html            E-mail:  homestay@andyou.com             Ace Homestay  http://www.ace-homestay.com/            Many large U.S.cities feature some Korean programming on cable TV or radio, and the         internet and shortwave radio also provides Korean broadcasts.

Korean language courses have been taught for many years at Pitt. Since the mid-1990s, two years of Korean instruction have been offered in the Institute for Less Commonly Taught Languages (LCTL). Korean language and culture courses are now offered through our department, beginning in January of 2003.                       More and more students are studying Korean language and culture courses each year. This parallels the rising international profile of Korea, in acknowledgment of its growing economic influence and its pivotal position in East Asian security, just to mention a few of such factors. Korean is regarded as one of the most difficult languages, on a par with Chinese, Japanese, and Arabic, for most students in the United States. You may therefore find it surprising that so many students are interested in learning the language. This trend comes, in part, from the fact that, in each succeeding year, the University of Pittsburgh is attracting more and more high-caliber students who love the challenge.             Since the Korean language and culture program joined the department, Korean language is offered at four proficiency levels (called Korean I through Korean IV). The language courses are designed to teach “standard Korean,” the spoken language and written forms of the language used by educated Koreans. In the two-year language program, students will learn how to function orally in basic and increasingly more complex linguistic situations, learn fundamental grammar, learn how to read and write Hangul, and recognize some Chinese characters.                  Asian Studies Certificate in Korean                Although our program does not yet offer a major in Korean language and culture, the University acknowledges your achievement in this area by issuing a certificate. When you successfully complete all the requirements for a certificate, it is noted in your academic transcript. More than 300 students are now enrolled in this certificate program in a variety of focal areas. For more information about enrolling in this program, contact  Dianne Dakis  at the  Asian Studies Center .                 Student placement                An advanced skill in any Asian language, including Korean, has long created a very favorable edge when looking for work. Our graduates from Chinese and Japanese programs have found work in various federal agencies and departments and private corporations. Any graduate-level work that pertains to Korea and East Asia in general will benefit greatly from the knowledge about the language and culture of the Korean Peninsula. Such relevance is more acutely felt in recent years when this region of the world has increasingly attracted attention not only for its cultural heritage but also for its economic power and relevance to international security issues.                  That’s not all                About 12,000 undergraduate and more than 10,000 graduate students study at the Oakland campus of the University of Pittsburgh. For this reason, Pitt can offer a rich learning environment, formal, informal, or in between, for practicing and making use of your language skills. In addition, not a week passes without lectures, performances, and other events that relate to East Asia on campus and in Pittsburgh. Our nationally ranked East Asian Library holds one of the largest collections of East Asian language materials in the nation. There we have a small but growing collection of Korean materials. You should also know that more than 40 faculty members on campus teach and research on various aspects of China, Korea, and Japan. In the early 1990s, the Korea endowment was established to fund and promote Korea-related activities on campus. The newly formed Korea Council, a group of faculty members with like minds, actively teach, conduct research on, promote Korea studies on campus, and disseminate information about Korea to the community. These are just some of the many offerings that can enrich your language learning experience at Pitt.                                                     Contact & Info         Certificate Program             Dianne Dakis  or           Asian Studies Center         Fast Facts         Our nationally ranked East Asian Library holds one of the largest collections of East Asian language materials in the nation.

Classification   The classification of the modern Korean language is uncertain, and due to the lack of any one generally accepted theory, it is sometimes described conservatively as a  language isolate .  A language isolate, in the absolute sense, is a natural language with no demonstrable genealogical (or genetic) relationship with other living languages; that is, one that has not been demonstrated to descend from an ancestor common to any other language. ...     Since the publication of the article of  Ramstedt  in 1926, many linguists support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an  Altaic  language, or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including  number ,  gender ,  articles , fusional morphology, voice, and  relative pronouns  (Kim Namkil). Korean especially bears some  morphological  resemblance to some languages of the Eastern Turkic group, namely  Sakha (Yakut) . Vinokurova, a scholar of the Sakha language, noted that like in Korean, and unlike in other  Turkic languages  or a variety of other languages surveyed, adverbs in Sakha are derived from verbs with the help of derivational morphology; however, she did not suggest this implied any relation between the two languages. [3]  Gustaf John Ramstedt (1873-1950) was a Finnish linguist who worked as professor extraordinarius in Altaic languages at the University of Helsinki. ...      Altaic is a proposed language family which includes 66 languages [1] spoken by about 348 million people, mostly in and around Central Asia and northeast Asia. ...

An article is a word that combines with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun. ...     A relative pronoun is a pronoun that marks a relative clause within a larger sentence. ...      For other uses, see Morphology. ...       Sakha, or Yakut, is a Turkic language with around 363,000 speakers spoken in the Sakha Republic in the Russian Federation. ...     The Turkic languages constitute a language family of some thirty languages, spoken across a vast area from Eastern Europe to Siberia and Western China with an estimated 140 million native speakers and tens of millions of second-language speakers. ...     It is also considered likely that Korean is related in some way to  Japanese , since the two languages have a similar grammatical structure. Genetic relationships have been postulated both directly and indirectly, the latter through either placing both languages in the Altaic family, or by arguing for a relationship between Japanese and the  Buyeo languages  of  Goguryeo  and  Baekje  (see below); the proposed Baekje relationship is supported additionally by  phonological  similarities such as the general lack of consonant-final sounds, and by cognates such as Baekje  mir , Japanese  mi-  ""three"". [4]  Furthermore, there are known cultural links between Baekje and Japan, it even being likely that the Baekje upper classes fled to Japan when the kingdom fell (a theory corroborated by Japanese Emperor  Akihito  in a speech marking his 68th birthday). [5]  The Buyeo (PuyÅ) languages are a hypothetical language family that would relate the languages of Buyeo, Goguryeo, Baekje and the Japonic languages, and possibly place them together as a family under the hypothetical Altaic family. ...     The Goguryeo language was spoken in the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE - 668), one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. ...        Baekje (October 18 BC â€“ August AD 660) was a kingdom in the southwest of the Korean Peninsula. ...       Phonology (Greek phonÄ“ = voice/sound and logos = word/speech), is a subfield of linguistics which studies the sound system of a specific language (or languages). ...       Akihito () (born December 23, 1933) is the current Emperor  ) of Japan, the 125th sovereign to hold that title, according to the traditional order of succession. ...     Others argue, however, that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a  sprachbund  effect. See  East Asian languages  for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian  sprachbund , and  Japanese language classification  for further details on the possible relationship.  A Sprachbund (German for language bond, also known as a linguistic area, convergence area, diffusion area) is a group of languages that have become similar in some way because of geographical proximity. ...     East Asian languages or the East Asian sprachbund describe two notional groupings of languages in East and Southeast Asia, either (1) languages which have been greatly influenced by Classical Chinese, or the CJKV Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese) area or (2) a larger grouping including the CJKV area as well...     The classification of the Japanese language is uncertain and disputed. ...     Of the ancient languages attested in the Korean Peninsula, modern Korean is believed to be a descendent of the languages of  Samhan  and  Silla ; it is unknown whether these are related to the Buyeo languages, though many Korean scholars believe they were mutually intelligible, and the collective basis of what in the  Goryeo  period would merge to become Middle Korean (the language before the changes that the  Seven-Year War  brought) and eventually Modern Korean. The  Jeju dialect  preserves some archaic features that can also be found in Middle Korean, whose  arae a  is retained in the dialect as a distinct vowel.     During the Samhan period, the three confederacies of Mahan, Jinhan, and Byeonhan dominated the southern portion of the Korean peninsula. ...

Jeju dialect is the dialect used on the island of Jeju in Korea, with the exception of Chuja. ...     There are also fringe theories proposing various other relationships; for example, a few linguists such as Homer B. Hulbert have also tried to relate Korean to the  Dravidian languages  through the similar syntax in both. [6]       The Dravidian family of languages includes approximately 73 languages[1] that are mainly spoken in southern India and northeastern Sri Lanka, as well as certain areas in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and eastern and central India, as well as in parts of Afghanistan and Iran, and overseas in other countries such...         Dialects       Main article:  Korean dialects                  Dialects of Korean       Korean has several  dialects  (called  mal  [literally ""speech""],  saturi , or  bang-eon  in Korean). The  standard language  ( pyojuneo  or  pyojunmal ) of South Korea is based on the dialect of the area around  Seoul , and the standard for North Korea is based on the dialect spoken around  P'yOngyang . These dialects are similar, and are in fact all mutually intelligible, perhaps with the exception of the dialect of  Jeju  Island (see  Jeju Dialect ). The dialect spoken in  Jeju  is in fact classified as a different language by some Korean linguists. One of the most notable differences between dialects is the use of stress: speakers of  Seoul dialect  use stress very little, and standard South Korean has a very flat intonation; on the other hand, speakers of the  Gyeongsang dialect  have a very pronounced intonation.

Courses:     Elementary Korean ( 101_F2006 ,    102_S2007 )         Intermediate Korean ( 105_F2006 ,  107_S2007 )         Advanced Korean ( 301_F2006 ,    302_S2007 )     Contemporary Korean & Culture ( 401_F2006 ,    402_S2007 )     Instructors:   Gwee-sook Kim       Joowon Suh   Korean Tables:   There will be a language table throughout the academic year.  Time and place will be announced at the beginning of each semester.

Available from Mondays to Fridays except on public holiday, with a target audience of the white collar working community and the urban young.   It is published by  Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd , which is part of the  Berjaya Media Berhad (formerly known as Nexnews Berhad) .  theSun  was launched in 1993, which was originally  The Sun . It became a free newspaper in 2002.           Contents       1   History   2   About Us   3   Target audience   4   Awards   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   Sun Media Corporation Sdn Bhd (SMCSB) was incorporated in Malaysia under the Act on 19 July 1991 as a private limited company under the name of Fikiran Abadi Sdn Bhd. On 8 December 1994, it changed its name to Sun Media Group Sdn Bhd before assuming its present name on 22 August 1998.   The principal activity of SMCSB is the publication of  theSun  newspaper, an English language national daily that was launched in 1993. On 8 April 2002,  theSun  newspaper was relaunched as a free national daily.   On 4 March 2008, Berjaya Corporation Berhad acquired a substantial stake from the holding company, Nexnews Berhad, and consequently SMCSB has been announced to be a subsidiary of Berjaya Corporation Berhad. On 23 April 2008, Nexnews Berhad changed its name to Berjaya Media Berhad.     [ edit ]   About Us   theSun  now covers national and international news as well as sports, property, media & marketing and lifestyle & entertainment. It has been redesigned for easy reading and has plenty of news briefs to cater to the reading habits of busy executives - the paper's target audience.   theSun  weekend was launched in the weekend of 15-16 May 2004, a revamp of its Saturday issue. It was however discontinued in March 2006 as it is not consistent with the free paper model. The well-read comments and opinion sections from the weekend edition have been moved to Thursday as  eXtra!   theSun  is currently the second largest English newspaper in Peninsular Malaysia in terms of circulation with an average daily circulation of 265,443 (Audit Bureau of Circulations Malaysia, as at 30 June 2007).   Under this new business model, SMCSB derives its revenue completely from advertising. SMCSB aims to offer advertisers the most cost effective way of reaching their customers. It has formed alliances with more than 500 business partners and channels such as major office complexes, convenience store chains, F & B outlets, stockbroking firms, banks and colleges for readers to pick up the newspaper for free. However, readers who want the convenience of having the newspaper delivered to their doorstep can subscribe to the delivery services at a very low delivery charge of RM0.30 per copy through their newspaper vendors.   Readers with broadband access can also access  theSun' s ePaper online for free at its website,  Sun2Surf  (www.sun2surf.com).     [ edit ]   Target audience   As of March 8, 2007,  theSun  prints and distributes 265,000 copies a day to approximately 2,200 targeted distribution points, called  SunSpots  (office buildings,  condominiums ,  LRT stations ,  fast food outlets ), primarily in the  Klang Valley , also known as  Kuala Lumpur  Metropolitan Area. People can also get a copy of  theSun  in almost all Malaysian  7-Eleven  stores. However, this figure is doubtful, as there is no mechanism in place to track the exact number of copies distributed, leading to many believing that The Sun actually trails far behind rivals  The Star  and  New Straits Times .   In 2006, prompted by the rising demand for copies and advertisers' thirst for a wider reach,  theSun , increased its print run by 76%. The increase took place in two phases, the first on 8 March, with circulation bumped up to 230,000 from 150,000 previously. The second phase saw circulation rising by another 15% to 265,000 copies on 2 October. Out of that, 215,000 copies are distributed in the Klang Valley, solidifying  theSun' s position as the top English daily in the nation's top consumer region.     [ edit ]   Awards   theSun  has won several awards for advertising. The Association of Accredited Advertising Agents Malaysia (4As) has awarded  theSun  the Media Partner of the Year Award (2004/2005). In the recent Malaysian Media Awards 2005, advertisements by MindShare/ Nike  and mediaedge:cia/ ING Insurance  published in  theSun  won Gold and Silver awards respectively.   In March 2007,  theSun  achieved another milestone when three of its journalists won top awards given by the Society of Publishers in Asia (SOPA) based in Hong Kong.   A first award, for Excellence in Opinion Writing, was for a series of six commentaries written by assistant news editor Jacqueline Ann Surin, who wrote a fortnightly column, Shape of a Pocket, published in the  eXtra!  section on Thursday. Surin beat an entry from the Far Eastern Economic Review's series of commentaries on Singapore, which received an honorary mention.   theSun' s second win, for Public Service Journalism, was for the story ""Low Cost Palace"" by the Special Reporting and Investigations team of editor R. Nadeswaran and deputy news editor Terence Fernandez who exposed the illegal mansion built by a former Selangor executive councillor.   SOPA again gave  theSun  two awards in 2008; honourable mentions for Terence Fernancez and R. Nadeswaran in Public Service Journalism for their reports on the failed sports training centre in Brickendonbury and for R. Nadeswaran for Opinion Writing for his Citizen Nades bi-weekly columns.

For centuries     Afghanistan has been used by invaders as their gateway to India and other     central Asian countries. Afghanistan has been the part of several mighty and     culturally empires, which left their legacy in the region. Rich and long     cultural heritage has been left in Afghanistan by Greeks, Persians and     Indians.              Islam had its impact on Afghanistan culture. Islamic threads were left in     the art, music, architecture and poetry of Afghanistan. Due to constant     battles and wars the cultural assets of Afghanistan have blemished in recent     days. Afghans are expert in embellishing their daily life articles with fine     arts and calligraphy.               Buzkashi         Buzkashi is one of the ancient games played in Afghanistan. Buzkashi     literally means ""goat killing"" and the name was derived from     hunting of mountain goats by champions on horseback. The game originated     from the time of Ghengis Khan, one of the rulers of medieval Afghanistan.     Provinces of Maimana, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Kataghan are the most popular     destinations for Buzkashi. Due to the religious belief women are not allowed     to watch the game. There are mainly two types of Buzkashi played, Tudabarai     & Qarajai.              Festivals         Afghans are lover of social life with abundance of music and festivals. An     Islamic country as it is festivals in Afghanistan are of Muslim origin. Eid     al Fitr (end of Ramadan) is the most important festival of Afghanistan. The     whole month of Ramadan is considered as the month of sacrifice and purity.     Muharram commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain. Eid al-Adha     (Eid-e-Qurban) is also one of the holy days of Afghans. New year day is     celebrated as Nau Roz on the first day of spring according to Afghan solar     calendar. Mawlud-un Nabi and Lailat-ul Qadr are also common festivals of     Afghanistan.               Food         Afghan cuisine is enriched with spices and rich aroma. Afghanistani cuisine     is mainly influenced by that of Persia, India and Mongolia. Main ingredients     are spices from India; mint, meat cookery, subzi from Persia and the     noodles/ pasta from Mongolia. Afghani cuisine is flavored with garam masala,     saffron, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, chilis, leeks, coriander, parsley, mint     and black pepper. Pulao and Qabli puloao are famous dishes from Afghanistan.     Vegetarian dishes are not so popular in Afghanistan. Due to environmental     factors people take food rich in fat and protein.               Ethnic Groups       Society of Afghanistan consists of number of ethnic groups, chief of whom     are Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras. These ehtnic groups practise     different ways of living, despite collectively inhabiting in the region for     hundreds of years. Their lifestyle defined by unwritten code, and they     choose their leaders, known as Begs or Khans to rule over them. Pashtuns or     Pakhtuns or Pathans or Persian Afghans are the largest ethnic group in     Afghanistan, constituting about two-fifth of Afghan population.               Inter Ethnic Relations       Afghan ethnic groups have had complex relationships. Several groups share     complicated and tense relations. Afghan governments have mostly been     dominated by the Pashtuns, with members of other tribes in secondary     positions. This fuels resentment in them. Often, zones of ethnic groups     overlap and become cause of tensions.

Wilgamesh  07:06, 20 May 2006 (UTC)           Contents       1   Biased Article   2   Poverty reason for India's rank   3   Gutter inspector's report   4   criterion for poverty   5   What is the average salary of a middle-class Indian?   6   India-China comparison   7   Update of India Picture   8   Orphaned references in Standard of living in India               [ edit ]   Biased Article   Is it just me, or does this article have a 'slight' bias to it. A true encyclopedia article does not suppose to contain an opinion, simply state mere fact. The author seems to imply that the idea of ""India moving to a more Western style consumer driven economy"" is a DEFINITE plus for India; does that mean those who reject a materialistic lifestyle are inferior in some way? You be the judge on that.     [ edit ]   Poverty reason for India's rank         http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1822829.cms       Seven of the top 10 happiest countries, according to the first 'World Map of Happiness', are from western democracies, while countries in Asia, known for their strong cultural values, family ties and collective identities surprisingly scored low  China (82), Japan (90) and Thailand (76).               While Denmark's satisfaction with life index was placed at 273.33, India's was at 180. The map, claiming to be the first to illustrate international differences in happiness, placed US at 23, UK at 41 and France at 62.    vkvora  06:49, 29 July 2006 (UTC)               [ edit ]   Gutter inspector's report   Why does this article not have any images on the rising middle class in India? The images make India appear like some kind of a toilet.  Wikindian  15:33, 10 August 2006 (UTC)     This article is sick and disgusting.It is offensive to the highest degree. Why isn't there an article on the Standard of living in  Haiti , or  Lesotho , or  Guatemala  (all of which have significantly lower living standards than India). Why is India bashed here (by other Indians, no less)? Hkelkar  13:01, 17 September 2006 (UTC)       [ edit ]   criterion for poverty   The criterion for poverty is 211.30 Rs for Rural India, Per month. I was surprised to read that, How can anybody manage for Rs 200 per month?   That should be atleast Rs 900 per month don't you think so? -- 219.91.198.10  10:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC)     [ edit ]   What is the average salary of a middle-class Indian?   Does anyone know what is the average salary (in U.S. dollar) of a middle-class Indian in India now? Please provide some sources or a link. Thanks.  72.140.11.75  ( talk ) 02:14, 16 April 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   India-China comparison   Why the constant comparison between India and China throughout this article? What does it aim to prove / clarify?  Preceding  unsigned  comment added by  59.95.66.28  ( talk ) 09:58, 13 June 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Update of India Picture   Hi, Great work with the nice statistical picture of India. However, I have a feeling that the data used in this picture is quite old and out of date. Lot of things have changed since then for example, India's HDI for year 2005 is  0.619  Karnataka's HDI is  released , Tamil Nadu has HDI of  0.736  in year 2006. I would go ahead and remove the picture from the article if it is not updated.  Docku  ( talk ) 02:18, 10 July 2008 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Orphaned references in  Standard of living in India   I check pages listed in  Category:Pages with incorrect ref formatting  to try to fix reference errors. One of the things I do is look for content for  orphaned references  in wikilinked articles. I have found content for some of  Standard of living in India 's orphans, the problem is that I found more than one version. I can't determine which (if any) is correct for  this  article, so I am asking for a sentient editor to look it over and copy the correct ref content into this article.   Reference named ""creaking"":     From  Education in India :  ""A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is Indias biggest handicap"" . The Economist. 2008 .  http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12749787 .     From  Transport in India :  A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is Indias biggest handicap  Dec 11th 2008  The Economist ]   From  Water supply and sanitation in India :  ""A special report on India: Creaking, groaning: Infrastructure is Indias biggest handicap"" .

The Role of Questions in Teaching      http://tinyurl.com/4bcm6       The Role of Questions in Teaching, Thinking and Learning  One of the reasons that instructors tend to overemphasize ""coverage"" over ""engaged thinking"" is that they assume that answers can be taught separate from questions. Indeed, so buried are questions in established instruction that the fact that all assertions-all statements that this or that is so-are implicit answers to questions is virtually never recognized.  No questions equals no understanding                                                                                                                                            Questioning in the Classroom      http://www.iun.edu/~edujal/e343/m201/questioning.html       Questioning in the Classroom  Questioning is critical to the teaching-learning process.

However, consider research which suggests that the learning of technical information can be achieved by learning to ask good questions   Knowing how to ask good questions enhances your comprehension by focusing on main ideas and making connections among ideas.                                                                                                                                                            use this box to search more on  Shambles  or on the  Web : (powered by Google)  :  safe filtering is ON                                                    Web                         Shambles Website                                  Shambles Home                                                                                                                                                        Use this form to submit links to               add to the list above (the webmaster will check the link before publication)                                   Heading:                                    Address:                              Please copy             Security Code                                           Description:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            webkeeper: Chris Smith  csmith@csmith.info                            Shambles RSS Feed  :                                       ( 17 entries) |  Click here to report broken links or problems  |                                                                                                                                webpage        with others                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ©        copyright        The Education Project Asia                                                                                                                               |   Shambles Home  |  Brunei Schools :  bn   |   Burma/Myanmar Schools :  mm  |   Cambodia Schools :  kh   |   China Schools :  cn   |  Hong Kong Schools :  hk   |   India Schools :  in  |  Indonesia Schools :  id  |   Japan Schools :  jp  |   Laos Schools :  la  |   Macau Schools :  mo  |  Malaysia Schools :  my  |  Philippines Schools :  ph  |  Singapore Schools :  sg  |  South Korea Schools :  kr   |  Taiwan Schools :  tw  |  Thailand Schools :  th   |   Vietnam Schools :  vn  |  email webmaster (Chris Smith)  |                                             "

Without proper  rendering support , you may see  question marks, boxes, or other symbols .       Zainichi Korean language  is a  language  or a  dialect  spoken by  Zainichi Koreans  ( ethnic Korean  citizens or residents of  Japan ). The speech is based on the  southern dialects  of  Korean , as the majority of first-generation immigrants came from the southern part of the peninsula, including  Gyeonggi-do ,  Jeolla-do , and  Jeju-do . Due to isolation from other Korean speech-communities and the  influence  of Japanese, Zainichi Korean language exhibits strong differences from the standard Korean of either North or South Korea.

The Korean language is used only in a limited number of social contexts: towards first-generation immigrants, as well as in  Chosn Hakkyo , (  ,  Hanja : , or  Chsen Gakk ;   , ""Korean School""), pro- Pyongyang  ethnic schools supported by  Chongryon .   Since most Zainichi Koreans learn Korean as their second language, they tend to speak it with a heavy Japanese accent. This variety of speech is called  Zainichi Korean language , a name which, even when used by Zainichi Koreans themselves, often carries a critical connotation. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Sounds     [ edit ]   Vowels   While Standard Korean distinguishes eight  vowels , Zainichi Korean distincts only five, as in Japanese.      :  /a/   ,  :  /o/   ,  :  //    :  /i/   ,  :  /e/       [ edit ]   Initial consonants   In  syllable-initial  position, standard Korean distinguishes among plain,  aspirated , and  tense   consonants , such as  /k/ ,  /k/ , and  /k/ . Zainichi Korean, on the other hand, distinguishes only between  unvoiced and voiced   consonants  ( /k/  and  // ), as in Japanese.       Standard Korean   Zainichi Korean       Beginning of a word   Elsewhere       Plain  /k/   Unvoiced  /k/  or voiced  // , depending on speakers       Aspirate  /k/   Unvoiced  /k/   Geminated  unvoiced  /k/       Tense  /k/       There are no geminates after  nasals . Thus   ,  /ana/  in Standard, becomes  /ana/ , not  /ana/ .   As in the North Korean standard, initial  //  or  /n/  never  change their values .     /jksa/  in  South Korea  is     /jksa/  in  North Korea , or  /josa/  among Zainichi Koreans.     [ edit ]   Final consonants   Seven consonants occur in the  final position  of Standard Korean  syllables , namely  /p/ ,  /t/ ,  /k/ ,  /m/ ,  /n/ ,  // , and  // . In Zainichi Korean, again, those sounds are treated differently.       Standard Korean   Zainichi Korean       Plosives  ( /p/ ,  /t/ , and  /k/ )   Followed by geminated consonants (ie.  /jok/  followed by  /sa/  becomes  /josa/ )       Nasals  ( /m/ ,  /n/ , and  // )   //  (as in  Japanese )       Flap  ( // )   //         [ edit ]   Grammar   Zainichi Korean grammar also shows influence from Japanese.   Some  particles  are used differently from the Standard Korean. For instance, ""to ride a car"" is expressed as  chareul tanda  (   ) in standard Korean, which can be interpreted as ""car-(direct object) ride"". In Zainichi Korean, the same idea is expressed as  cha-e tanda  (   ; ""car-into ride""), just like Japanese  kuruma ni noru  (  ).   Standard Korean distinguishes  hae itda  (   , referring to a continuous state) and  hago itda  (   , referring to a continuous action). For instance, ""to be sitting"" is  anja itda  (   ), not  ango itda  (   ), as the latter would mean ""being in the middle of the action of sitting, but has not completed the action yet"". Zainichi Korean, however, does not distinct these two, as Japanese does not either; it uses  hago itda  form for both continuous state and continuous action.     [ edit ]   Writing system   Zainichi Korean is not typically written; standard Korean is used as the  literary language . For example, a speaker who pronounces the word  geureona  (  ; ""however"") as  gurona  (  ), will still spell the word in the former form. In much the same way, Standard Korean speakers retain the  grapheme  difference between  ae     and  e    , even though they may pronounce the two identically.     [ edit ]   References       ^   Io , a magazine published by  Choson Sinbo , had a report titled     (Zainichi Korean language is strange in these ways) , criticizing this variety of Korean, which  can't be  called  urimal  (literally ""our language"") anymore"".

The  Goguryeo language  was spoken in the ancient kingdom of  Goguryeo  (37  BC    AD  668), one of the  Three Kingdoms of Korea . The language is also known as Koguryo, Koguryoic, and Koguryoan. It is unknown except for a small number of words, which mostly suggest that it was similar but not identical to the language of  Silla , and influenced by the  Tungusic languages . Supporters of the  Altaic language family  often classify the Goguryeo language as a member of that language family. Most Korean linguists believe that Goguryeo language was closest to the Altaic languages. Striking similarities between  Baekje  and Goguryeo can also be found, which is consistent with the legends that describe Baekje being founded by the sons of Goguryeo's founder. The Goguryeo names for government posts are mostly similar to those of Baekje and Silla. There are some hypotheses on the classification of the Goguryeo language which is disputed at the present time.  [1]  Some linguists propose the so-called "" Buyeo languages "" family that includes the languages of  Buyeo , Goguryeo, Baekje, and Old Japanese. Chinese records suggest that the languages of Goguryeo, Buyeo, East  Okjeo , and  Gojoseon  were similar, while the Goguryeo language differed significantly from that of Malgal ( Mohe ) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]   Some words of Goguryeo origin can be found in the old Korean language (early 10th to late 14th century) but most were soon replaced with ones of Silla origin.
