clueweb09-en0000-47-14558	"             AVP’s 2008 Olympics Blog Site     AVP’s 2008 Olympics Blog Site                         About the AVP            The AVP was established in 1983 and is comprised of the best men’s and women’s pro beach volleyball players in the U.S. and arguably, the world. The AVP’s main goal is to deliver its fans the experience of an amazing athletic contest surrounded by an unforgettable beach party. More than one million people are expected to attend an AVP event this year. On May 31, 2001 the AVP was reorganized with a new management team led by agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. When they announced the acquisition of the tour in Manhattan Beach, Calif. they made a historic move by uniting both men and women professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization. With this historic unification of the men’s and women’s competitions, the “new” AVP Tour has been able to capitalize on having one property that could maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money. The AVP now stands alone as the only pro beach volleyball tour in the country and has a cooperative relationship with USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB).

The AVP's main goal is to deliver its fans the experience of an amazing athletic contest surrounded by an unforgettable beach party. More than one million people are expected to attend an AVP event this year. On May 31, 2001 the AVP was reorganized with a new management team led by agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. When they announced the acquisition of the tour in Manhattan Beach, Calif. they made a historic move by uniting both men and women professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization. With this historic unification of the men's and women's competitions, the ""new"" AVP Tour has been able to capitalize on having one property that could maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money. The AVP now stands alone as the only pro beach volleyball tour in the country and has a cooperative relationship with USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB).

Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass., decides to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball.

The BVA is created to guide and promote the growth of women's beach volleyball in the United States. ""A strong domestic tour is crucial in order to develop US athletes for the top levels of international play, in particular the Olympic Games in Sydney."" said Charlie Jackson, tour CEO. For this reason, BVA is working closely with the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and the Olympic Challenge Series (OCS) to maximize opportunities for the women and avoid schedule conflicts.           2000     BVA     In May, the BVA held its first tournament in Oceanside, CA.

The last team to qualify, Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana win the gold over Brazilians ZMarco and Ricardo Costa.  The 15th-seeded German team of Jg Ahmann and Axel Hager are surprise bronze medalists.

Holly's five victories in 2000 (three FIVB, one BVA, and one OCS) moved her to 55 career victories just 12 behind all-time leader Karolyn Kirby and just three behind Jackie Silva.           2001     AVP     On May 31, Agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus announce that they have acquired the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) and will unite the world's best men's and women's professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization.   With this historic unification of the men's and women's competition, the 2001 AVP Tour will be able to capitalize on having one property that can maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money.  The AVP will now stand alone as the only professional beach volleyball tour in the country.  It will follow the regulations set forth by USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and will allow its players to compete in official tournaments en route to the 2004 Olympics.               2001     FIVB     The 2001 Goodwill Games feature Beach Volleyball competitions from August 29 to September 4 in Brisbane, Australia with the world's sixteen best men's and women's teams.

May and Walsh not only won all eight AVP Nissan Series events they entered, but they also compiled a perfect 39-0 match record -- the first time any team has ever gone through an entire season without losing a match.  En route to their perfect record, Misty and Kerri only lost five sets in compiling a 78-5 set record and outscoring their opponents 1711-1236.  Despite playing one tournament less than their main rivals, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs, Misty and Kerri also won the points championship to earn each of them a one-year lease on a Nissan vehicle of their choice.           2004           Misty May and Kerri Walsh extend their match winning streak to 57 after beating Jia Tian and Fei Wang of China in the SemiFinals of the Brazil Open.

The Brazilian pair had been tied at 30 with Linda Hanley and Nina Matthies since September, 2002 -- needing 14 tournaments to add the historic victory.           2004     AVP     In the semi-finals of the Manhattan Beach Open, Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis snap the 89-match winning streak of Misty May and Kerri Walsh by the score of 21-19 and 21-19 in 36 minutes.  The last time Misty and Kerri had been defeated was July 5, 2003 by Ana Paula Connelly and Sandra Pires in the finals of the Norway Open.  During the streak, Misty and Kerri also won a 90th unofficial match over Vanilda dos Santas Le and Gerusa da Costa Ferreira in a U.S. vs. Brazil series.

FIVB President Dr. Rub Acosta Hernandez met with the players and reached an agreement that favors the continued success of the SWATCH-FIVB World Tour and SWATCH-FIVB World Championships, powered by Smart, to further the growth of the sport.  Three ""major"" items were agreed with the players, including the creation of Beach Volleyball Player's Commission for each gender. The commissions will be made up of seven players each and will meet at least once a year in Lausanne, Switzerland in a date to be determined.           2006     AVP     With their win at the Santa Barbara Open, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh become the first women's team with 50 tournament titles.           2006     AVP     With her win at the AVP Cuervo Gold Crown Huntington Beach Open and the $50,000 paycheck, Misty May-Treanor becomes the second American woman to top the $1 Million mark in career winnings.

They join Mike and Patty Dodd, who accomplished the feat four times in 1989, but each time in different locations.         2006    AVP    Also in Seaside Heights, Elaine Youngs' second place finish (with Rachel Wacholder) pushes her career earnings past $1 million. She becomes the third American woman to achieve that mark.         2006    AVP    Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor win in Chicago as Walsh joins the millionaire club. She is the 18th person worldwide to win over $1 million in her career, and did so in fewer events (90th tournament) as well as being one of just four to reach the mark before turning 28 years old.         2006    AVP    Kerri Walsh establishes the new AVP mark for women's victories in a single season, as her title with Misty May-Treanor in Lake Tahoe marked her 14th of the season. The event in Lake Tahoe also featured light snowfall for the first time ever during a pro beach volleyball tournament.         2006    AVP    In Acapulco, Mexico, Jake Gibb and Sean Rosenthal won the men's FIVB title while Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh won the women's, marking the first time since June 2003 that American men and women won the same international event.         2007    AVP    Suffering a first-round loss in Huntington Beach, Mike Lambert and Stein Metzger rebound to win the title after reeling off eight straight elimination matches. They become the only known team to lose in the first round of a 32-team draw yet win the title.         2007    AVP    Misty May-Treanor becomes the women's all-time wins leader by capturing her 73rd victory, surpassing Holly McPeak's record by winning with Kerri Walsh in Hermosa Beach. She reached this total in just 123 tournaments.         2007    AVP    Jen Boss and April Ross emerge from the qualifier in the FIVB Grand Slam in Stavenger, and as the 29th seed, win the tournament. The duo became the lowest seeded women's team to win in the 15-year history of the FIVB.         2007    AVP    In a championship match that lasted 1:41, Nicole Branagh and Elaine Youngs defeat Jennifer Boss and April Ross 21-19, 18-21, 16-14 in Seaside Heights. The marathon set the record for the longest match in rally scoring, men or women, in domestic or international play.         2007    AVP    The semifinals in Chicago featured 14th-seeded Jenny Kropp and Jenny Pavley, who became the lowest seeded team to ever advance to the semifinals in AVP women's history.         2007    AVP    With their third straight Manhattan Beach Open title, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh have tied for the most consecutive Manhattan Beach Open victories with the team which won the first three ever held (Jean Brunicardi and Johnette   "

Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass., decides to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball. He creates the game of Volleyball (at that time called mintonette). Morgan borrows the net from tennis, and raises it 6 feet 6 inches above the floor, just above the average man's head.                     1920s                 There are unconfirmed whispers of men teams playing on the beach in Hawaii, but most accounts place the sport's origin in Santa Monica, California where the first Volleyball courts are put up on the beach at the Playground.

The BVA is created to guide and promote the growth of women's beach volleyball in the United States. ""A strong domestic tour is crucial in order to develop US athletes for the top levels of international play, in particular the Olympic Games in Sydney."" said Charlie Jackson, tour CEO. For this reason, BVA is working closely with the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and the Olympic Challenge Series (OCS) to maximize opportunities for the women and avoid schedule conflicts.                      2000        BVA        In May, the BVA held its first tournament in Oceanside, CA.

The last team to qualify, Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana win the gold over Brazilians ZMarco and Ricardo Costa.  The 15th-seeded German team of Jg Ahmann and Axel Hager are surprise bronze medalists.  Surprise women's top-seeded Australians Natalie Cook and Kerri-Ann Pottharst held true to their seed in winning the gold medal over the second-seeded Brazilians Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede.  Brazilians once again dominate the women's competition as Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel win the bronze.                      2000        FIVB        Brazilians dominate the men's season with three teams combining to win nine of the thirteen events.

World Champions Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede of Brazil led all teams with four victories.  The American teams of Holly McPeak and Misty May, who finished ranked 2nd, and Liz Masakayan and Elaine Youngs, who finished 4th, each won three tournaments while fellow Americans Annett Davis and Jenny Johnson Jordan, who finished 3rd, claimed the other victory for the United States.                     2000        BVA        Holly McPeak becomes the richest women in beach volleyball, passing Karolyn Kirby early in the season and topping the $700,000 mark in career earnings.  Holly's five victories in 2000 (three FIVB, one BVA, and one OCS) moved her to 55 career victories just 12 behind all-time leader Karolyn Kirby and just three behind Jackie Silva.

With this historic unification of the men's and women's competition, the 2001 AVP Tour will be able to capitalize on having one property that can maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money.  The AVP will now stand alone as the only professional beach volleyball tour in the country.  It will follow the regulations set forth by USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and will allow its players to compete in official tournaments en route to the 2004 Olympics.                         2001                 Christopher ""Sinjin"" Smith plays the final match of his impressive career, a 21-19 and 24-22 loss with George Roumain to Dax Holdren and Todd Rogers in the 4th round of the contender's bracket at the AVP Manhattan Beach Open.

FIVB President Dr. Rub Acosta Hernandez met with the players and reached an agreement that favors the continued success of the SWATCH-FIVB World Tour and SWATCH-FIVB World Championships, powered by Smart, to further the growth of the sport.  Three ""major"" items were agreed with the players, including the creation of Beach Volleyball Player's Commission for each gender.

Prior to that time, A. J. Demarest High School, dedicated in the autumn of 1911, served as the city's high school. [ 4 ]  When the current high school was built, Demarest became a junior High School (grades 8-9), and it is currently a Vocational High School in the district. The first principal of Hoboken HS was Tom Gaynor - Boys were required to wear button down shirts with ties and a jacket or sweater - long hair was frowned on by Mr. Gaynor.

[ 5 ]     [ edit ]   IB program   The International Baccalaureate Diploma Program is a comprehensive and rigorous two-year curriculum, leading to examinations, for students in grades eleven and twelve. The general objectives of the IB are to provide students with a balanced education; to facilitate geographic and cultural mobility; and to promote international understanding through a shared academic experience. In the 30 years since its founding, the IB diploma has become a symbol of academic integrity and intellectual promise. The student who satisfies its demands demonstrates a strong commitment to learning, both in terms of the mastery of the subject content and in the development of the skills and discipline necessary for success in a competitive world.   IB courses are college preparatory courses within high schools complete with the expectations of increased reading and oral and written reports. The final exams are evaluated by a panel of professors from around the world who are experts in their respective fields. Courses involve an internal assessment factor requiring teachers to submit essays and student tapes for grading to external examiners.

Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass., decides to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball. He creates the game of Volleyball (at that time called mintonette). Morgan borrows the net from tennis, and raises it 6 feet 6 inches above the floor, just above the average man's head.                     1920s                 There are unconfirmed whispers of men's teams playing on the beach in Hawaii, but most accounts place the sport's origin in Santa Monica, California where the first Volleyball courts are put up on the beach at the Playground. Families play 6 vs. 6.                     1927                 Beach Volleyball crosses the Atlantic Ocean. It becomes the principal sport in a French nudist camp founded in Franconville, a north-western suburb of Paris.                      1930s                 The first two-man beach volleyball game is played in Santa Monica, California.                      1930s                 Beach volleyball appears in Palavas, Lacanau and Royan (France), around Sofia (Bulgaria), Prague (Czechoslavakia), and Riga (Latvia).                      1930s                 In the US, people escape the depression by going to the beach; 4 vs 4 and 3 vs 3 games are played.                       1944                                             Changes to the volley ball rules: the ball could be played with any part of the body from the knees upward; the score of a forfeited game would be 15-0.                            1947                 The first official two-man Beach Volleyball tournament is held at Will Rogers State Beach, California with no prize money. It is organized by Bernie Holtzman and won by Manny Saenz and Harris.                     1948                 The first tournament to offer a prize is held in Los Angeles, California. It awards the best teams with a case of Pepsi.                     1950s        Parks&Rec                     The first circuit is organized by the Parks & Recreation Departments on five beaches in California: Santa Barbara, Will Rogers State Beach, Sorrento Beach, Laguna Beach, and San Diego. In the database, this era is referred to as Parks & Recreation (P&R).                      1950s                 In Brazil, the first tournament sponsored by a newspaper publishing company takes place.                      1950s                 The beginning of ""Beachmania"": Beach Volleyball becomes an entertainment show with Beauty Contests included in the official program.                     1957        Parks&Rec        Bernie Holtzman and Gene Selznick win an event that features Greta Tyson, star of ""Pajama Tops"", as Queen of the Beach. Beach volleyball becomes more than a sport; it turns into a real show.                      1960s                              In France, the winners of 3 vs. 3 games earn about 30,000 French Francs in tournaments in La Baule and les Sables d'Olonne.                      1960s        Parks&Rec        Open tournaments are held on thirteen beaches in California: Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, Will Rogers State Beach, Manhattan Beach, Corona del Mar, Laguna Beach, San Diego, Mission Beach, Newport Beach, Rosecrans, Sorrento Beach, Marine Street, and Laguna Niguel. The first Manhattan Beach Open takes place in 1960.                       1960s        Parks&Rec        President Kennedy attends the first official Beach Volleyball event in Sorrento Beach, Los Angeles.                     1965        Parks&Rec        The California Beach Volleyball Association (CBVA) is founded.

Lisa Arce and Barbara Fontana capture the title and split the $15,000 first prize.                     2000        AVP        Veteran Mike Whitmarsh wins his first King of the Beach title and Barbara Fontana is crowned Queen of the Beach at the combined men's and women's season ending event                     2000        AVP        In a season of parity, eight different teams win tournaments in the eleven event season.  Brazilian's Jose Loiola and Emanuel Rego top the season with three victories.                     2000        BVA        In its inaugural season, five different teams win in the seven scheduled events.  At the season ending Kyocera U.S. Championships, volleyball greats, Karolyn Kirby and Liz Masakayan reunite and finish 5th                     2000        FIVB        The second Olympic Beach Volleyball competition takes place from September 16 to 26 in a specially constructed 10,000 seat venue at Bondi Beach near Sydney, Australia. Twenty-four men's and women's teams compete for Olympic medals. Despite the perfect score in qualifying, Brazilians Jose Loiola and Emanuel Rego finish a dissapointing 9th.  The last team to qualify, Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana win the gold over Brazilians ZMarco and Ricardo Costa.  The 15th-seeded German team of Jg Ahmann and Axel Hager are surprise bronze medalists.  Surprise women's top-seeded Australians Natalie Cook and Kerri-Ann Pottharst held true to their seed in winning the gold medal over the second-seeded Brazilians Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede.  Brazilians once again dominate the women's competition as Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel win the bronze.                      2000        FIVB        Brazilians dominate the men's season with three teams combining to win nine of the thirteen events.  Jose Loiola and Emanuel Rego win five events, World Champions Zarco and Ricardo Costa win four and newcomers Marcio Araujo and Benjamin Insfran win two.                     2000        FIVB        The American women dominated the women's season with three teams finishing in the top four in rankings and combining to win seven of the thirteen events.  World Champions Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede of Brazil led all teams with four victories.  The American teams of Holly McPeak and Misty May, who finished ranked 2nd, and Liz Masakayan and Elaine Youngs, who finished 4th, each won three tournaments while fellow Americans Annett Davis and Jenny Johnson Jordan, who finished 3rd, claimed the other victory for the United States.                     2000        BVA        Holly McPeak became the richest women in beach volleyball, passing Karolyn Kirby early in the season and topping the $700,000 mark in career earnings.  Holly's five victories in 2000 (three FIVB, one BVA, and one OCS) moved her to 55 career victories just 12 behind all-time leader Karolyn Kirby and just three behind Jackie Silva.                     2001        AVP        On May 31, Agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus announce that they have acquired the Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) and will unite the world's best men's and women's professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization.   With this historic unification of the men's and women's competition, the 2001 AVP Tour will be able to capitalize on having one property that can maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money.  The AVP will now stand alone as the only professional beach volleyball tour in the country.  It will follow the regulations set forth by USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and will allow its players to compete in official tournaments en route to the 2004 Olympics.                         2001        FIVB        The 2001 Goodwill Games feature Beach Volleyball competitions from August 29 to September 4 in Brisbane, Australia with the world's sixteen best men's and women's teams. The men's medallists are, gold: Jose Loiola and Ricardo Santos (Brazil), silver: bronze: Martin Conde and Eduardo Martinez (Argentina), and bronze: Stein Metzger and Kevin Wong (United States). The women's medallists are, gold: Sandra Pires and Tatiana Minello (Brazil), silver: Adriana Behar and Shelda Bede (Brazil), and bronze: Pauline Manser and Kerri-Ann Pottharst (Australia), and bronze: Elaine Youngs and Barbra Fontana (United States).                      2002        AVP        With his 143rd career victory at the AVP Michelob Light Santa Barbara Open Presented by Paul Mitchell, Karch Kiraly becomes the oldest player to win a professional domestic beach volleyball tournament.  The win with Brent Doble, the 12th partner to taste victory with Karch, comes at the age of 41 years, 225 days.                     2002                 Holly McPeak becomes the first woman to win $1Million in prize money.  Winning her 62nd career title, the 6th with Elaine Youngs, at the FIVB French Grand Slam in Marseille nets her $15,000 to bring her career total to $1,001,927.                     2002                 Karch Kiraly becomes the first beach volleyball player to break the $3 Million mark in prize money.  His share of the $7,500 for finishing 3rd at the season ending Paul Mitchell AVP Shootout at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas with Brent Doble brings his total career earnings to $3,001,258.                     2003        AVP        Misty May and Kerri Walsh capped of a perfect season with their victory at the Las Vegas Aquafina AVP Shootout Presented by Bud Light.  May and Walsh not only won all eight AVP Nissan Series events they entered, but they also compiled a perfect 39-0 match record -- the first time any team has ever gone through an entire season without losing a match.  En route to their perfect record, Misty and Kerri only lost five sets in compiling a 78-5 set record and outscoring their opponents 1711-1236.  Despite playing one tournament less than their main rivals, Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs, Misty and Kerri also won the points championship to earn each of them a Nissan vehicle of their choice.

For other uses, see  Springbok .   The South Africa national  rugby union  team (commonly referred to as the  Springboks  in English,  Springbokke  in  Afrikaans  and  Amabokoboko  in  Zulu ), are the current holders of the  Rugby World Cup  and are currently ranked number 2 in the  IRB World Rankings . In addition to playing in the World Cup they play in a number of other international competitions such as the Tri-Nations and a number of tests.   Although South Africa was instrumental in the creation of the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks did not compete in the first two World Cups in the  1987  and  1991  due to  anti-Apartheid  sporting boycotts of South Africa. The team made its World Cup debut in  1995 , when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. The Springboks then defeated the All Blacks 15-12 in the  final , which is now remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa's sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-Apartheid nation-building process. South Africa regained their title as champions in 2007, when they defeated  England  156 in the  2007 final . As a result of the 2007 World Cup tournament, the Springboks were promoted to first place in the IRB World Rankingsthe first time that they have reached the number one position.   The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys, and their emblems are the  Springbok  and the  Protea . The side have been playing international rugby since 1891, when a  British Isles  side toured the nation, playing South Africa in their first Test on 30 July. South Africa is currently coached by  Peter de Villiers , after  Jake White , who led the Boks to the 2007 World Cup title, announced his resignation effective at the end of 2007. The current captain is  John Smit , who has played most of his career at  hooker , but was moved to  tighthead prop  for the  2008 end of year tests .

The first-ever  British Isles  tour took place in 1891, with the trip financially underwritten by  Cape Colony   Prime Minister   Cecil Rhodes . [ 2 ]  These were the first representative games played by South African sides, who were still learning the game. The tourists played and won a total of twenty matches, conceding only one point in the process. [ 3 ]  South Africa's first ever Tests were played, although South Africa did not exist as political unit until 1910. In a notable event of the tour, the British side presented the  Currie Cup  to  Griqualand West , the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour. [ 4 ]   The British Isles' success continued on their 21 game tour of  1896 . The British Isles won three out of the four Tests against South Africa. South Africa's play improved markedly from 1891. Their forwards were particularly impressive, and their first ever Test win in the final game was a pointer to the future. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]  For the first time South Africa had worn myrtle green shirts, which their captain, Barry Heatlie, borrowed from his Old Diocesian club. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours, which created great interest in the South African press. [ 7 ]   Rugby was so popular that in 1902 there was a temporary ceasefire in the  Second Boer War  so that a game could be played between British and Boer forces [ citation needed ] . The game had spread amongst the Afrikaner population through  POW  games during the Boer War, [ 8 ]  and afterwards  Stellenbosch University  became a training ground for future players and administrators. [ 9 ]   In 1903 the British Isles lost a series for the first time in South Africa, drawing the opening two Tests before losing the last 80. In all, the tourists won just 11 of their 22 tour games. [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  By contrast, South Africa would not lose another serieshome or awayuntil 1956. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Springboks       Paul Roos , Springbok captain, of the first South African touring rugby team to the British Isles in 1906.              The 1906 Springboks team.       Paul Roos  was the captain of the first South African team to tour the  British Isles and France . The team was largely dominated by players from the Western Province, and took place over 190607. The team played 29 matches; including Tests against all four  Home Nations . England managed a draw, but Scotland was the only one of the Home unions to gain a victory. [ 12 ]   During this tour the nickname  Springboks  was first used. At an impromptu meeting, team captain Paul Roos invented the nickname to prevent the British press from coining their own nickname. [ 13 ]  Newspaper reporters were to call the team ""De Springbokken"", and later  The Daily Mail  printed an article referring to the ""Springboks"". [ 14 ]  The team thereafter wore blazers with a springbok on the left breast pocket. Historically the term 'Springbok' was applied to any team or individual representing South Africa in international competition regardless of sporting discipline. This tradition was abandoned with the advent of South Africa's new democratic government in 1994. [ 15 ]  The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride among South Africans. [ 9 ] [ 16 ]   The South Africans crossed the channel to play an unofficial match against a 'France' team drawn from the two Parisian clubs:  Stade Franais  and  Racing Club de France . The official French team were in England at the time. The Springboks won 556 and scored 13 tries in the process. [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   The 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa was the first to include representatives from all four Home unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The tourists won just one of their three Tests. [ 19 ]   The Boks' second European tour took place in 191213. They beat the four  Home nations  to earn their first  Grand Slam  and also went on to defeat France. [ 9 ] [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Inter war   By the first World War New Zealand and South Africa had established themselves as rugby's two greatest powers. [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  A New Zealand Army match tour of South Africa in 1919 paved the way for a Springbok tour to New Zealand and Australia in 1921. The tour was billed as ""The World Championship of Rugby"". [ 23 ]  The All Blacks won the first Test 135, which included a try by All Blacks  winger   Jack Steel  who had sprinted 50 metres with the ball trapped between his right hand and back to score. [ 24 ]  The Springboks recovered to win the second Test 95 thanks to a  Gerhard Morkel  drop-goal. [ 24 ]  The final Test was drawn 00 after being played in terrible conditionsresulting in a series draw. [ 25 ]   The 1924 British Lions team to South Africa struggled with injuries and won only nine of 21 games. They lost all four Tests to the Springboks, but despite the results, the tour produced some attractive rugby. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  This was the first side to pick up the name Lions, [ 28 ]  apparently picked up from the Lions embroidered on their ties. [ 29 ]   The All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928, and again the Test series finished level. Despite playing most of the second half with only 14 men, with a dominant scrum and fly-half  Bennie Osler , the Springboks won the first Test 170 to inflict the All Blacks' heaviest defeat since 1893. [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  The All Blacks rebounded to win the second Test 76. After a Springbok win in the third Test, the Springboks needed to win the fourth to secure a series victory. The New Zealanders bought back  Mark Nicholls  for his only Test of the series, [ 32 ]  and their captain  Maurice Brownlie  told the team a week before the Test that ""Under no circumstances whatever is anyone of you so much as to touch a rugby ball until we play the Springboks in the last test."" [ 33 ]  Their tactics were successful and the All Blacks won 135 to draw the series. [ 32 ]   Despite winning South Africa's second Grand Slam, the  Springbok tourists of 193132  were an unloved team. They had a jumbo pack and a kicking fly-half in captain  Bennie Osler . Their tactics of kicking for territory earned them criticism both in South Africa and abroad. [ 34 ] [ 35 ]  It was successful however, the team winning against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as defeating all their Welsh opponents for the first time. [ 36 ]   In 1937 South Africa  toured New Zealand and Australia  and broke the deadlock with a series win in New Zealand. Their 21 series win prompted them to be called ""the best team to ever leave New Zealand"". [ 37 ]  Despite the All Blacks winning the first Test, the Springboks' won in the third Test 176 and scored five tries to none. [ 38 ]  The All Blacks' loss was considered a humiliation in New Zealand. [ 38 ]   The British Isles toured South Africa again in 1938, winning more than half of their normal matches. The Springboks easily claimed the first two tests. But the tourists recorded a surprise win in the third Test, the first Lions win in South Africa since 1910. [ 39 ]     [ edit ]   Post-war era   Danie Craven  was appointed coach in 1949, and started his coaching career with a bang. The Springboks won ten matches in a row, including a 40 whitewash of New Zealand on their 1949 tour to South Africa. [ 40 ]  Prop Okey Geffin helped kick the Springboks to victorythey won all four Tests despite the All Blacks scoring more tries in three of them. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]  The 195152 team that toured Europe was considered amongst the finest Springbok sides to tour. [ 20 ]  The team won the Grand Slam as well as defeating France.  Hennie Muller  captained the side after original captain  Basil Kenyon  suffered a serious eye injury. The South African highlight of the tour was a 440 defeat of Scotland. [ 34 ]  The defeat of Scotland included nine tries, and was a record at the time. [ 43 ]  The team finished with only one loss, to London Counties, from 31 matches. [ 44 ]   During their 1955 tour to South Africa, the Lions won 19 and drew one from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series ended in a draw. In 1956 the All Blacks won its first ever series over the Springboks, in what Chris Hewett called ""in the most bitterly fought series in history."" [ 45 ]  Surprise selection  Don Clarke  from  Waikato nicknamed  the Boot kicked the decisive penalties in the final Tests. [ 46 ]   South Africa had defeated France 253 at  Colombes Stadium  in 1952, and when France toured South Africa in 1958 they were not expected to compete. [ 47 ]  Georges Duthen described the mood of the French players before their first Test in 1958: ""They were going into battle. A Battle for France. And they hadn't a hope..."" [ 47 ]  France exceeded expectations and drew 33 with after a drop goal to French  scrum-half  Pierre Danos and unconverted try to South Africa's Butch Lochner. [ 48 ]  The French then secured a Test series victory in South Africa with their 95 victory in front of 90,000 spectators in Johannesburg. [ 49 ]  The French feared the South African forwards, especially their scrum, and focused much of their training before the series on improving the ""South African"" style of their forwards. [ 50 ]  The decisive moment of the match was French forward Jean Barthe's tackle on Jan Prinsloo near the French try-line prevented a certain try. The momentum then swung to France who scored drop-goalsone each to Pierre Lacaze and Roger Martineto secure the historic victory. [ 51 ]     [ edit ]   1960s   Even before the  apartheid  laws were passed after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of  George Nepia  and  Jimmy Mill  from the 1928 All Blacks tour, [ 52 ] [ 53 ]  and the dropping of  Ranji Wilson  from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, [ 54 ]  had attracted little comment at the time. However, in 1960 international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of the  The Wind of Change  speech and the  Sharpeville massacre . [ 55 ]   From this point onward, the Springboks were increasingly the target of international controversy and protest. The All Blacks toured in 1960, despite a campaign based on the slogan of ""No Maoris, No Tour"", and a 150,000 signature petition opposing it. [ 56 ]  The Springboks avenged their 1956 series defeat by winning the Test series 21 with a Test drawn. [ 57 ]  The first match was won 130 by the Springboks with two tries to  Hennie van Zyl . [ 58 ]  New Zealand journalist Noel Holmes said after the match ""I hang my head in shame for having suggested that your forwards might be slow, even unfit."" [ 59 ]  The All Blacks won the second Test 113 which they did so with a dominant forward pack and the tactical kicking of Don Clarke. [ 59 ]  The players selected for the third and fourth Tests formed the core of Springboks side for the next three seasons. [ 60 ]  The third Test was drawn 1111 after a last minute sideline conversion from All Black Don Clarke. [ 61 ] [ 46 ]  The deciding Test was won 83 by the Springboks with the decisive try scored by  Martin Pelser . [ 62 ]   Later that same year the Springboks themselves toured, and led by Avril Malan they defeated all four Home unions for their fourth Grand Slam. On a four-month, 34 game sweep through Europe they played a ruthless, forward-oriented game in which intimidation was a key part, and opposition players suffered a string of controversial injuries. However, they lost their final game 60 against the  Barbarians  in  Cardiff , beaten when perhaps the Barbarians' pack played an uncharacteristically pragmatic game.   In 1962 the British Isles, won 16 of their 25 games on their tour to South Africa, but did not do so well in the Testslosing all three.   Wales toured South Africa and played several games and one Test in 1964their first overseas tour. [ 63 ]  They lost the Test against South Africa in  Durban  243, their biggest defeat in 40 years. [ 64 ]  At the  Welsh Rugby Union  (WRU) annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that ""it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football."" [ 63 ]   South Africa had a disastrous year in 1965, losing on tour to Ireland, Scotland, Australia (twice) and New Zealand (three times) while winning just once against New Zealand. The planned 1967 tour by the All Blacks was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union after the South African government refused to allow Maori players.   In 1968 the Lions toured and won 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but lost three Tests and drew one. Next year the 1969 Springbok tour to Britain and Ireland found a new spirit and confidence had developed in Home nations rugby, and the tourists lost two of their seven games in Walesagainst  Newport  and a composite side from Monmouthshire. Wales nearly claimed their first win against the Springboks as the game ended 66. The Springboks lost the Test matches against England and Scotland, drawing the one against Ireland. Throughout the tour however, large anti-apartheid demonstrations were a feature, and many matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences.     [ edit ]   1970s   In 1970 the All Blacks toured South Africa once againafter the 1967 stand-off, the South African government now agreed to treat Maoris in the team, and Maori spectators, as 'honorary whites'. The Springboks won the test series 31.   The  Springbok tour of Australia in 1971  began with matches in  Perth , then  Adelaide  and  Melbourne . The Springboks won all three Tests, scoring 186, 146, and 1911. As in Britain three years before however, massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the team, and they had to be transported by the  Royal Australian Air Force  after the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. Although a tour of New Zealand had been planned for 1973, it was blocked by New Zealand  Prime Minister   Norman Kirk  on the grounds of public safety. [ 65 ]   The Lions team that toured South Africa in 1974 led by  Willie John McBride  was unbeaten over 22 games, and triumphed 30 (with one drawn) in the Test series. A key feature was the Lions' infamous '99 call'. Lions management had decided that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, so decided ""to get their retaliation in first"". At the call of '99' each Lions player would attack their nearest rival player. The idea was that a South African referee would be unlikely to send off all of the Lions. At the ""battle of  Boet Erasmus Stadium ""one of the most violent matches in rugby history JPR Williams  famously ran over half of the pitch and launched himself at 'Moaner' van Heerden after such a call. [ 66 ]   The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead, and the Springboks won by three Tests to one, but coming shortly after the  Soweto riots  the tour attracted international condemnation and 28 countries boycotted the  1976 Summer Olympics  in protest, and the next year, in 1977, the Commonwealth signed the  Gleneagles Agreement , which discouraged any sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. Four years later  Errol Tobias  would became the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was stopped by the French government, who announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France.     [ edit ]   1980s   The Lions toured South Africa in 1980. The team completed a flawless non-Test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-Test matches on the tour. But they lost the first three Tests before winning the last one.   The  1981 tour of New Zealand  went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 21, but the tour and the massive civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby.   South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the  South American Jaguars  to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players, whose national team had struggled to attract strong international opposition. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980sall awarded Test status.   In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the  New Zealand High Court . A rebel tour took place the next year by a team known as  the Cavaliers . The team was not sanctioned by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, yet consisted of all but two of the original squad that had been selected. [ 67 ]  The team was advertised inside South Africa as the All Blacks, and the Springboks won the series.   In 1989, a World XV sanctioned by the International Rugby Board went on a mini-tour of South Africa. All traditional rugby nations bar New Zealand supplied players to the team with ten Welshmen, eight Frenchmen, six Australians, four Englishmen, one Scot and one Irishman.     [ edit ]   1990s   From 1990 to 1991 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in 1992. They struggled to return to their pre-isolation standards, and in their first game after readmission the Springboks were defeated 2724 by New Zealand on 15 August 1992. Ian McIntosh was sacked as national coach following a series defeat to the All Blacks in New Zealand in mid-1994. In October of that year,  Kitch Christie  accepted an offer to take over from McIntosh.   South Africa was selected to host the  1995 Rugby World Cup , and there was a remarkable surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities in the lead-up to the tournament. This was the first major event to be held in what Archbishop Desmond Tutu had dubbed ""the  Rainbow Nation ."" South Africans got behind the 'one team, one country' slogan.   By the time they hosted the 1995 World Cup, the Springboks were seeded ninth. They defeated Australia,  Romania ,  Canada ,  Western Samoa  and  France  to play in the final. South Africa won the epic World Cup Final against traditional rivals the All Blacks 1512 at Ellis Park. A drop goal by  Joel Stransky  secured victory in extra-time. The New Zealanders claimed to have been affected by a virulent food poisoning the day before the fixture. [ 68 ] [ 69 ]   Wearing a Springbok shirt,  Nelson Mandela  presented the trophy to captain  Francois Pienaar , a white Afrikaner. The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans. SARFU President  Louis Luyt  caused controversy at the post-match dinner by declaring that the Springboks would have won the previous two World Cups if they had been allowed to compete. The day after the World Cup victory, the  Xhosa  word for Springbok,  Amabokoboko!  appeared as the headline of  The Sowetan 's sports page.           Bobby Skinstad  in June 2007.       A series of crises followed in 1995 through 1997 as it became clear that South African rugby was an unreformed element of the new Rainbow Nation. The team was also struck by tragedy, as Christie, who had led them to victory in all 14 Tests he coached, was forced to resign in 1996 after battling leukemia for more than a decade. An on-field slump saw South African sides struggle in the new  Super 12  and  Tri-Nations  competitions. Under new coach  John Hart  and the captaincy of  Sean Fitzpatrick , the All Blacks won a Test series in South Africa for the first time in 1996. [ 70 ]  Fitzpatrick even rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated. [ 70 ]  The 1997 Lions completed their South African tour with only two losses in total, winning the Test series two games to one.   Coach  Andre Markgraaff  quit in 1997 over a racial comment he made and his successor,  Carel du Plessis , got sacked in 1997 and replaced by  Nick Mallett . In 1998 Mallett and new captain  Gary Teichmann  produced a record winning streak, winning 17 consecutive Tests, including the 1998 Tri-Nations. In the same year, South Africa mourned as Christie's illness claimed his life. The Springboks entered the  1999 Rugby World Cup  competition with little hope. Reverting to a kicking game and forward strength, they showed they were still a force to be reckoned with, losing to eventual champions Australia in a tense semi-final at  Twickenham .     [ edit ]   New millennium           Percy Montgomery  running the ball for the Springboks against  Samoa  in 2007.       At Twickenham in November 2002 England defeated South Africa 533 which was their worst ever. An increasingly frustrated South African side began physically targeting England players during the match, with footage showing captain  Corn Krige  as a leader. [ 71 ]  In the 2002 and 2003 seasons, the Springboks also lost by record margins to France, Scotland and New Zealand. They defeated  Argentina  by only one point, and were easily defeated in the quarter finals of the  2003 World Cup .   During a pre-World Cup training camp, there was a highly publicised dispute between  Geo Cronj  (an Afrikaner) and  Quinton Davids  (a coloured). Both were dropped from the team, and Cronj was called before a tribunal to answer charges that his actions in the dispute were racially motivated. Cronj was eventually cleared. Later, the Boks were sent to a military-style boot camp in the South African bush called  Kamp Staaldraad  (literal English translation ""Camp Steel-wire"", idiomatically ""Camp Barbed Wire""). After the World Cup, then- coach  Rudolph Straeuli  was under fire, not only because of the team's poor results, but because of his role in organising Kamp Staaldraad. He eventually resigned, and in February 2004  Jake White  was named as new national coach.   The Springboks then swept Ireland in a two-Test series and defeated Wales during their opponents' June 2004 tours of the Southern Hemisphere. Next came a win in  the most closely-contested Tri Nations in history their only Tri Nations trophy since 1998. In November 2004, the Springboks went on a Grand Slam tour of the Home Nations. They were decisively defeated by England, and lost controversially to Ireland. They then won a hard-fought match against Wales, and prevailed comfortably against Scotland. The Springbok resurgence was honoured with a sweep of the major  International Rugby Board  awards. The Boks were named Team of the Year, White Coach of the Year, and flanker  Schalk Burger  Player of the Year.   In 2005 the Springboks defeated an embarrassed  Uruguay  by a world record margin. Zimbabwean-born new cap,  Tonderai Chavanga , scored a record six tries in the match, surpassing  Stefan Terblanche 's previous record of five. The side finished second in the Tri-Nations that year, losing their final match to New Zealand.The springboks thought they had the match before Keven Mealamu scored the match winning try for the All Blacks in the 27-31 loss. The year ended positively with close victories away from home against Argentina, among others.   With several new players aboard, the 2006 Springboks defeated Scotland twice in South Africa, before a loss in a closely contested match to France ended their long undefeated home record. A very bad start to the  2006 Tri Nations Series  saw them lose 490 to the Wallabies. The Springboks put together better games in the following two matches, losing in the final minutes in the second test against Australia. Answering the call from many South African supporters to play a more expansive style of rugby, coach Jake White fielded a far more adventurous team. They broke South Africa's five game losing streak by beating the All Blacks 2120 at  Royal Bafokeng Stadium the first time a Test match had been played at this rural venue near Rustenburg. The All Blacks' defeat to the South Africans was their only loss of the year. The highlight of South Africa's tour to Europe was the 2415 win over England at Twickenham, after a loss to Ireland and one to England the previous week. A South Africa XV also played a World XV on this tour at the  Walkers Stadium  in Leicester.   In July 2006, Springbok coach  Jake White  told the press he had been unable to pick some white players for his squad ""because of transformation""a reference to the ANC governments policies attempting to redress the racial imbalances in national sport.     [ edit ]   Rugby World Cup 2007          The Springboks       Grouped in Pool A at the  2007 Rugby World Cup  in France, they opened their campaign in Paris with a 597 victory over Samoa. Next up was England at the Stade de France, where the Springboks triumphed 36-0. The third pool game against Tonga in Lens was more competitive and they narrowly won 3025. The final pool game against the USA in Montpellier produced a 6415 win.   Having won all their pool games, they advanced to the quarter finals to defeat Fiji 3720 before accounting for Argentina 3713 in the semi-finals. They prevailed 156 over England in a try-less final to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time on 20 October 2007. The Springboks join Australia as the only other national team to win the trophy twicereinforcing the southern hemisphere dominance in the tournament with five out of six titles to date.     [ edit ]   Apartheid and transformation   Even before the apartheid laws were introduced to South Africa in 1948 the Springboks had been an all white team. The team became a symbol of racial division within South Africa, and following the first open elections in 1994, the ruling  African National Congress  (ANC) instituted a policy of  transformation  in South African sport. In this context transformation can be defined as ""a complete alternation of the appearance or character of South African rugby"", and one aim is to transform the Springboks into a team more representative of South Africa's race and class. [ 72 ]   South Africa's World Cup winning side of 1995 fielded only one non-white player ( Chester Williams ). This continued in the team's biggest matches of the 1999 and 2003 World Cups, and in the 2007 World Cup final the team fielded two non-white players. [ 73 ]  Despite a quota system existing to encourage Super 14 and provincial teams to field non-white players, and the fact that there are more non-white than white rugby players in South Africa, [ 74 ]  transformation has been slow in the opinion of many. South African Rugby Union president Oregan Hoskins considered the number of non-white players in the 2007 World Cup squad too low, [ 73 ]  and in 2008 the first non-white coach of the side was appointed. The political pressure on rugby coaches and administrators to select non-white players is strong; 16 of the 35 new Springboks appointed by former coach Jake White were non-white. [ 73 ]  ANC Minister of Parliament Butana Komphela expressed a view held by many politicians in the country when he said ""Sport cannot be excluded from imperatives of empowerment and transformation."" [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Strip   South Africa play in green jerseys, white shorts and green socks. Their jersey is embroidered with the SA Rugby logo on the upper left corner and the  flag of South Africa  on the sleeve and traditionally has a gold collar. The strip is made by  Canterbury of New Zealand  and their shirt sponsor is South African synfuels and chemicals company  Sasol . The green jersey was first adopted when the British Isles toured South Africa in 1896. [ 13 ]  On their first tour to Great Britain and Ireland in 190607 the South Africa wore a green jersey with white colour, blue short, and blue socks. A replica strip was worn in 2006 against Ireland in Dublin to mark the centenary of the tour. [ 75 ]  When Australia first toured South Africa in 1933, the visitors wore sky blue jerseys to avoid confusion, as at the time, both wore dark green strips. In 1953, when Australia toured again, the Springboks wore white jerseys for the test matches. In 1961 Australia changed their jersey to gold to avoid further colour clashes. [ 76 ]   The springbok nickname and logo also dates from the 19067 tour of Britain. The springbok was chosen to represent the team by tour captain Paul Roos in an attempt to prevent the British press from inventing their own name. The logo was not restricted to the white team alone, the first coloured national team used the springbok in 1939 and the first black team in 1950. [ 13 ]  After the fall of apartheid in 1992 the a wreath of  proteas  were added to the logo. When the ANC was elected in 1994 the team's name was not changed to the Proteas like that of other South African sporting teams only because of the intervention of President  Nelson Mandela . [ 13 ] [ 77 ]   In December 2008, the SARU decided to place the protea on the left side of the Boks' jersey, in line with other South African national teams, and move the springbok to the right of the jersey. [ 78 ]  The new jersey will be worn for the first time when the  British and Irish Lions   tour South Africa in 2009 . [ 79 ]     [ edit ]   Home grounds   The Springboks do not use a national stadium as their home, but play out of a number of venues throughout South Africa. The 60,000 seater  Ellis Park Stadium  in  Johannesburg  was the main venue for the  1995 World Cup , [ 80 ]  where the Springboks defeated the All Blacks in the final. Other regular venues for tests include  Pretoria 's  Loftus Versfeld Stadium , the  Newlands Stadium  in  Cape Town , the  ABSA Stadium  in  Durban ,  Vodacom Park  in  Bloemfontein , and the  EPRFU Stadium  in  Port Elizabeth . [ 81 ]   The first ever South African international took place at Port Elizabeth's  St Georges Park Cricket Ground  in 1891. [ 82 ]  Ellis Park was built in 1928, and in 1955 hosted a record 100,000 people in a Test between South Africa and the British Lions. [ 80 ]   The Springboks are said to have a notable advantage over touring sides when playing at high  altitude  on the  Highveld . [ 83 ]  Games at Ellis Park, Loftus Versfeld, or Vodacom Park are said to present physical problems, [ 84 ] [ 85 ]  and to influence a match in a number of other ways, such as the ball travelling further when kicked. [ 86 ]  Experts disagree on whether touring team's traditionally poor performances at altitude are more due to a state of mind rather than an actual physical challenge. [ 85 ]     [ edit ]   Records     [ edit ]   Tri Nations   South Africa's only annual tournament is the  Tri-Nations  competed with Australia and New Zealand. South Africa have won the tournament twice; in  1998  and  2004 . South Africa also contest the  Mandela Challenge Plate  with Australia, and the  Freedom Cup  with New Zealand as part of the Tri-Nations.

South Africa's introduction to the event was as hosts. They defeated defending champions Australia 2718 in the opening match, and went on to defeat the All Blacks 1512 after extra time in the  1995 Rugby World Cup Final , with a drop goal from 40 metres by  Joel Stransky . [ 87 ]  In  1999  South Africa suffered their first ever World Cup loss when they were defeated 2127 by Australia in their semi-final; they went on to defeat the All Blacks 2218 in the third-fourth play-off match. [ 88 ]  The worst ever South African performance at a World Cup was in 2003 when they lost a pool game to England, and then were knocked out of the tournament by the All Blacks in their quarter-final. [ 89 ]  In  2007  the Springboks defeated Fiji in the quarter-finals and Argentina in the semi-finals. They then defeated England in the  final  156 to win the tournament for a second time.     [ edit ]   Overall          South Africa's  world ranking  from 10 October 2003 to 13 August 2007.       IRB World Ranking Leaders                     South Africa are currently ranked number two in the  world rankings . When the ranking system was introduced in October 2003 South Africa were ranked sixth. They rose to fifth in November that year before falling back to sixth in March 2004. After rising back to fifth in June 2004, they rose to fourth in December that year. They rose to third, then second in 2005. They fell from that high of second to third in July 2006, and were ranked fourth by December 2006. Between then and May 2007 they have fluctuated between fourth and fifth, before settling at fourth by September 2007. They then gained top spot after winning the  2007 Rugby World Cup , temporarily lost it to New Zealand after losing to them in July 2008 - only to regain it with their first ever victory over the All Blacks in Dunedin the following week. But weeks later with back to back victories, the All Blacks regained number one.

Captain John Smit reverted to his longtime role as hooker, with Chiliboy Ralepelle providing cover on the bench.       [ edit ]   Individual records           Percy Montgomery  is South Africa's most capped player, and holds the South African record for Test points.       South Africa's most capped player is  Percy Montgomery  with 102 caps, placing him  joint sixth  with  Wallaby   Stephen Larkham  on the all-time list in international rugby. Montgomery also holds the South African record for Test points with 893, which is  sixth-highest  in international rugby. [ 93 ]  The most points Montgomery ever scored in a single international was 35 against  Namibia  in 2007this is also a South African record.   South Africa's most-capped captain and most-capped forward is  John Smit , who has captained South Africa in 55 of his 81 Tests. Smit also played 46 consecutive matches for South Africa, which is a record. The record try scorer is  Joost van der Westhuizen  who scored 38 tries in his 89 appearances. [ 93 ]     [ edit ]   Notable players   Nine former South African internationals have been inducted into the  International Rugby Hall of Fame . One of those,  Danie Craven , has also been inducted into the  IRB Hall of Fame .   Bennie Osler played 17 consecutive Tests between 1924 and 1933. Playing at  fly-half , his first Test was against the touring British team in 1924. He also played in the series against the All Blacks in 1928, but most notably captained the Springboks on their Grand Slam tour of 193132 when they defeated all four  Home Nations . [ 94 ]  His last Tests were the five played against Australia when they toured to South Africa in 1933. [ 95 ]   Making his Test debut in Olser's Grand Slam winning team in 1931 was  scrum-half  Danie Craven. Craven played several positions including fly-half, scrum-half,  centre  and even  number eight . [ 96 ]  However Craven was most famous for popularising the dive pass. [ 97 ]  As well as winning a Grand Slam with Osler's team, Craven toured with 1937 Springboks to New Zealand where they achieved their first ever series victory over New Zealand. [ 98 ]  His last act as player was captaining South Africa in a Test series against the Lions. [ 96 ]  Craven's involvement with the Springboks continued after his playing retirement, and he coached them to a 40 series win over the touring All Blacks in 1949. [ 40 ]  He was elected President of the South African Rugby Board in 1956, a position he held until the post-apartheid South African Rugby Union was formed in 1991. Craven was instrumental in the formation of the South African Rugby Union and became its first Executive President. [ 98 ]  Such was Craven's influence in South African rugby he became known as ""Mr Rugby"", and was in the second class of inductees into the IRB Hall of Fame; behind  Rugby School  and  William Webb Ellis . [ 98 ]   The man most credited with inventing modern number 8 play was  Hennie Muller . [ 99 ]  He played 13 Tests between 1949 and 1953, and in the process won a 40 series victory over the All Blacks and a Grand Slam tour of Britain and Ireland. [ 100 ]  He was nicknamed  Windhond  (greyhound) due to his speed around the field. [ 99 ]  When writing about the 1949 series against the All Blacks, Harding and Williams wrote: ""(Okey)  Geffin  won the series, perhaps, but Muller made it possible."" [ 42 ]  Of Muller's 13 Tests, he only lost oneagainst Australia in 1953. [ 100 ]   Named South Africa's player of the 20th Century in 2000,  Frik du Preez  played 38 Tests between 1961 and 1971. [ 101 ]  Du Preez could play both  flanker  or  lock  and was one of the most dominant forwards of the 1960s, [ 101 ]  but was especially well known for his all round skills. [ 102 ]  Danie Craven said of du Preez, ""To my mind he could have played any position on a rugby field with equal brilliance."" [ 101 ]   Morne du Plessis  played 22 Tests for South Africa between 1971 and 1980. [ 103 ]  His debut was at Number 8 in South Africa's series win over Australia in 1971. He went on to captain South Africa and became part of the only father-son pair to captain South Africahis father had captained South Africa in 1949. [ 104 ]  He led South Africa to a 31 series win over the All Blacks in 1976 and a series win over the British Lions in 1980 by the same margin. [ 105 ]   Both International Hall of Fame inductees  Naas Botha  and  Danie Gerber  had careers interrupted by South Africa's sporting isolation in the 1980s and early 1990s. Botha made his Test debut against the South American Jaguars in 1980. Playing at fly-half, Botha played 28 Tests and scored 312 Test points before his international retirement in 1992. [ 106 ]  Botha contributed significantly to the Springboks 1980 series win over the Lions, and also played for the World XV in the IRB Centenary Match at  Twickenham . [ 107 ]  Gerber also made his debut in 1980, and scored 19 tries in his 24 Tests before retiring in 1992. [ 108 ]  He scored a hat-trick against England in 1984, and played alongside Botha in the World XV team in 1986. In South Africa's first Test since the fall of apartheid, against the All Blacks in 1992, he scored twice. [ 109 ]   Two players that straddled the amateur and professional eras were  Francois Pienaar  and  Joost van der Westhuizen . Both first played for the Springboks in 1993. Pienaar was named captain in his first Test against France, and went on to captain the side to the 1995 World Cup. [ 110 ]  It was there he captained South Africa to the World Cup title, and received the trophy from  Nelson Mandela  who was wearing his number 6 jersey. [ 111 ]  Nelson Mandela later wrote ""It was under Francois Pienaar's inspiring leadership that rugby became the pride of the entire county. Francois brought the nation together."" [ 110 ]  Joost van der Westhuizen also participated in the 1995 World cup victory, but went on to play in two more World Cups. Playing at scrum-half, van der Westhuizen played 89 Tests for South Africa and scored 38 tries. [ 112 ]  At the time of his retirement following the 2003 World Cup he was South Africa's leading try scorer and most capped player.

They will defend their Olympic Gold on a few days as they face No. 1 seeded Chinese team Joan Tian/Jie Wang.    With 107 straight match wins and three consecutive world championships in their back pocket, they are not stressing out about the hometown advantage China will have at Chaoyang Park.    Yesterday, the sun set on Jake Gibb and Sean Rosenthal’s shot at an Olympic medal.  They battled against Brazil’s reigning gold medalists Ricardo/Emanuel point for point but at 12-12, Emanuel/Ricardo took the lead and would not relinquish it resulting in a 21-18, 21-16 defeat over Gibb/Rosenthal.    Brazil continues to be a powerhouse in beach volleyball. They are ahead in the beach volleyball medal count and will be able to add more to their resume following these games. Not only are the two aforementioned Brazilian teams in the semis, the No. 15 Georgian team that surprised everyone by making it to the final four is made up of Brazilians-turned-Georgian citizens, Renato Gomes and Jorge Terceiro.  They became Georgian citizens to avoid the rule that limits each country to having only two teams representing it in the Olympics.    Congratulations to the “Redeem Team” for crushing Germany last night 106-57!  Many of our AVP athletes have had the opportunity to attend and support the basketball team the past couple weeks just as they have been doing for us!    Stay tuned for more from the Men’s Semifinal where Rogers/Dalhausser with face Georgia’s Georg/Gia!

The victims of the Dalhausser/Rogers beatdown were Renato Gomes and Jorge Terceiro…those names may ring a bell as they are native Brazilians that became Georgia citizens to compete in the Olympics. Because of the country quota system on the FIVB, only two teams from each country are given Olympic berths.  With Emanuel/Ricardo and Marcio/Fabio receiving the berths, Gomes/Terceiro found other means to the Olympics through Georgia.    On Friday (Thursday evening in the US), Todd and Phil will play against Brazil’s Marcio and Fabio, who upset reigning gold medalists and Brazil’s number 1 team of Emanuel and Ricardo 22-20, 21-18.  Kerri  Walsh and Misty May-Treanor will compete for the gold medal in the women’s final Thursday (Wednesday evening in the US) against China. If they succeed, they will make history as the first team ever to win consecutive gold medals in beach volleyball.  The win will also mark  Kerri Walsh’s 100th victory.

During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in  Division III  (non-scholarship) and then  Division II  (scholarship) of the  National Collegiate Athletic Association  (NCAA), and all teams have competed in  Division I  since Fall 1991.

The baseball team beat top-ranked North Carolina, 7-6, in front of a crowd of 1,033. After jumping out to a 4-1 lead, UNCG withstood several Tar Heel rallies, including a pair of runs in the top of the ninth inning before closer Patrick Currin slammed the door.

In a 12-day span, UNCG knocked off Big East foe West Virginia at home and ACC member Wake Forest on the road. It was UNCGs first-ever win over a Big East school and the programs first victory over Wake Forest since 1977.   In March 2006, the UNCG womens basketball team made its first SoCon Tournament title game appearance since 2002. The Spartans rallied from nearly all of a 21-point deficit, closing to within three in the final four minutes. However, Chattanooga pulled away late for a 91-79 win.   There is a student organization dedicated to cheering on the Spartans in all of their athletic events called the Blue Crew. The Blue Crew adds an excitement to games and makes every team feel unwelcomed with a sea of blue/yellow tie dyed shirts and loud cheers.

On Tuesday September 23, 2008 Chicago Bears safety Kevin Payne                  along with Staley the Bears’ mascot appeared at the Cotter                  Boys & Girls Club in support of Nickelodeon’s “World                  Wide Day of Play.” Payne visited and played a game of flag                  football with Club members. The day included activities like Musical                  Pies, Water balloon toss and Potato sack races.

Teens participated in                  a day long, behind the scenes tour at the Chicagoland Speedway                  to encourage career exploration in the NASCAR world. Club members                  wore credential passes that allowed them access to every area                  of the race track. It is guaranteed that these young people will                  never forget the day that allowed them to attend the drivers meeting,                  get a garage tour, have dinner at the food hauler, walk on the                  race track and watch pit stops up close and personal. All of the                  teens declared that this was their first NASCAR experience, but                  would not be their last.

clueweb09-enwp00-58-21254	"                     Dax Holdren          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search              Medal record         Dax Holdren       Men's  Volleyball       Competitor for the    United States       World Championships       Silver   2003 Rio de Janeiro   Beach Volleyball       Dax Holdren  (born September 4, 1972 in  Santa Barbara, California ) is an American professional  beach volleyball  player. Holdren is currently on the  AVP  tour playing with  Jeff Nygaard .   Holdren was a late-comer to the sport of volleyball and did not begin playing until his junior year in high school. [ 1 ]  He joined the AVP in 1997 and was the tour's rookie of the year. [ 2 ]  He started his career playing with  Todd Rogers , a teammate of his at  San Marcos High School  in Santa Barbara. The duo had eight wins together, including a World Tour victory in 2000 that was reached through qualification. Following his partnership with Rogers, Holdren partnered with  Eric Fonoimoana  for two AVP seasons. In 2002, they were considered the dominant partnership on tour. [ 3 ]  Fonoimoana split with Holdren in 2003.   Holdren represented the United States with partner  Stein Metzger  at the  2004 Summer Olympics  in  Athens , Greece, where they finished fifth. The duo were not expected to win medals despite their unexpected win of the silver medal at the  2003 Beach Volleyball World Championships  in  Rio de Janeiro , Brazil. Holdren and Metzger split as partners following their finish out of the medals in Athens; both Holdren and Metzger are smallish players for beach volleyball and had no plans to continue as partners, leading to Holdren's current pairing with Nygaard. [ 4 ]  During the 2005 AVP season, Holdren and Nygaard were the second-ranked pair in the league. [ 5 ]  Holdren himself finished second on the tour in digs with 909. [ 6 ]  Holdren and Nygaard are still primary partners, but in the 2007 season, Nygaard's treatment for cancer has reduced their play time together. While Nygaard underwent treatment, Holdren partnered with  Kevin Wong  in several tournaments. [ 7 ]   In his career, Holdren has 14 total wins on the AVP tour (eight with Rogers, five with Fonoimoana, one with Nygaard), most recently coming in 2005. He has had several sponsors, notably being sponsored by  Nautica  along with  Mike Lambert . [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   References       ^  Robinson, Jon. ""Dax Holdren Interview.""

The view from the            Strand  – bring it on!                                   Home is where the heart is – beach volleyball's birthplace explodes            with the AVP.                                                        • Manhattan            Beach Bars and Restaurants             • Surfest            – Photos & Video             C ulture, tradition            and socializing come together like waves to the sand at the annual Manhattan            Beach Open AVP pro beach volleyball tournament. Talk about a beach party!           AVP            stands for the Association of Volleyball Professionals, but this tournament            has been around long before there was such an organization. It is such            a part of this Southern California surfside city that people turn out            by the thousands, sitting on towels, in beach chairs or just on the            sand cheering on the pros of the game they play on these same courts            the rest of the year. In fact, the sport was born on this very beach.                               The sacred sand of Manhattan, THE place the pros want to win.            Beijing Olympic Gold Medalists Todd Dalhausser and Todd Rogers.           The 2008 Croc's AVP Manhattma Open was held Sept. 19-21, more than a month later than its usual mid-August date because of the Summer Olympics. And it was the Olympians who earned a plaque on the Pier, the Gold Medal teams of Todd Rogers and Phil Dalhausser taking the men's title and Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor the women's. Rogers and Dallhausser defeated Nick Lucena and Sean Scott 21-16, 21-16 on Sunday. Walsh and May-Treaor disposed of Jennifer Boss and April Ross 21-18 and 21-16 on Saturday. Each has now won this coveted title three consecutive years.                       In the stands, the fans enjoy the setting of the Manhattan Open.           For this event,  the outer courts and much of the grandstands were free. The only tickets being were are for courtside seats. While some feel the beach and the tournament should always be free – after all, the sport was invented right here in Manhattan Beach – others like the fact they can roll up at any time and have a great seat for the weekend.                         In the  beachside bars , the fans enjoy the setting of the Manhattan Open.                          Anyone who can get down on Friday is rewarded with the ability to walk right up to a court and watch the pros only a few feet away from the action. This is one of the great pleasures of this sport.                       Eight-time winner            Karch Kiraly celebrates hi s '04 title with fans in the bar.           The Manhattan Open is to Manhattan Beach what the Masters is to Augusta,            the Rose Bowl is to Pasadena, Wimbledon is to England. It's the sport's            premier event, beach volleyball's Super Bowl, its Daytona 500. To win            the Manhattan Open defines one as a true player – you haven't            arrived in this sport until you've won Manhattan.           In the beginning years of the Manhattan Open, the victors won dinner            and a pitcher of beer at a local restaurant. Most importantly, however,            they became ""Kings of the Beach"" for a year. Modern-day winners            get a few more dollars but definitely covet being the ""Kings""            and now ""Queens"" more than a paycheck. It has become so popular            that the AVP needs to add a few more rows of seats to accommodate the            fans. Added entertainment, such as testing the speed of one's volleyball,            serve and slot-car racing give the event an NFL Experience type of atmosphere.            Except, of course, it's on the beach. And it's Manhattan.                                 On the sand and            in the stands, the action is hot at the Manhattan Open.                       ""This is the biggest tournament we've got,"" said Kevin Wong,            who teamed with Stein Metzger to win in 2001. ""It is so special            to win here. This is so wonderful!"" In 2004, Karch Kiraly spoke            for everyone who has ever played this tournament when he said, ""You            talk to any player and if they were told they could only win one tournament            in their whole career, everybody would choose it to be here in Manhattan.            There's an extra fire among all the players.""           In 2005, Jake Gibb teamed with Metzger to win and couldn't contain            his emotions afterward. ""This event is so special,"" Gibb said.            ""it means to much to the sport. I can't believve it – can't            fathom it. This is a sweet one."" He added, ""Other tournaments,            I go in thinking about the volleyball. I came into this one thinking,            this is  Manhattan!""           AVP Manhattan            Open Photos           Click Here for 2008 AVP Manattan Photos, Pictures of the Bars & Party Scene and past tournaments                                                       The PubClubettes            prepare to party at the Shellback Tavern. Watch out!                                They know – as do all others who came before them and who will            come after them – Manhattan is THE beach volleyball victory.           After            matches – and in particularly victory in Manhattan – the players            mingle with the fans. In the bas.           More specifically, meet them in  Shellback Tavern,  the legendary            beachside bar.           This, more than anything else, defines this tournament. It's tradition            for the winners to go to the bars and party with the fans. The people            are probably the most knowledgeable sports fans anywhere and the players            like hanging with such cool folks. Imagine Vladimir Guerrero doing this after            an Angeles game. Or Kobe after a Lakers game.           It certainly fits right in with the area. In this part of the world,            cocktails and volleyball go together like the beach and bikinis. People            park it on the sand and fish cold ones out of coolers while sitting            only feet away from star players like Rogers and Dalhausser or Walsh and May-Treanor. In between            matches, it's off to one of the two beachside bars.  Then it's            back to the beach, then back to the bar, the beach again, then the bar            for good.           Shellback's is the top place to celebrate on Sunday after the tournament. On Saturday it's packed, as well, but because it's bigger, there's even more of a crowd at the other bar off the beach,  Beaches.  It has two levels and much of the action and entertainment (that is to say, the locals partying) is in the main bar downstairs.           Manhattan is such a cherished event that legendary star Sinjin Smith            picked Manhattan to retire after some 25 years of action. Sinjin is            a true local hero, and not just because he won Manhattan five times            (more than 250 events in all). He and onetime partner Randy Stoklos            were the undisputed Kings of every beach, winning an incredible 113            of 225 tournaments. ""Smith and Stoklos"" were as synonymous            with the beach as Montana and Rice were with football.           But            it was off the sand where Sinjin made his biggest mark on the sport.            Eager to earn more than dinner and beer for winning tournaments, he            hired his own PR guy, began to get media attention, and, eventually,            sponsors. At first, this alienated the game's traditionalists, who felt            volleyball should stay true to its low-key roots. They felt otherwise            when, by the early 90s, prize money was in the hundreds of thousands            and beach volleyball became an Olympic sport. Sinjin was to beach volleyball            what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what Arnold Palmer was to golf.           A few years ago he retired and it was only appropriate that Manhattan            was his final tournament. Oddly, it wasn't on center court, where he            starred for so many years, but on an outer court as darkness approached            and a chilly wind began to blow. Most people who watched him all day            were in the bars by this time, unaware of the historical moment that            transpired just a block away.           Now, however, the torch has been passed along to players like Metzger            and, possibly, Gibb. It must also be pointed out that Kiraly has won            Manhattan a record eight times, including an incredible four in a row            from 1990-93 and his first with Smith in 1980. And they all keep the            long-standing appreciation for what it means to win the Wimbledon of            beach volleyball.

Ross. Born the son of a carpenter in Dornoch, Scotland in 1872, Mr. Ross became a fine golfer and instructor, and learned the art of greenskeeping and clubmaking from legendary Old Tom Morris in St. Andrews. His early instructional successes landed him in New England and then at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina where he would eventually design, and rebuild, four courses at Pinehurst including the world famous #2 course.    It was the beginning of a long and illustrious career noted for a daring design marked by steep slopes and undulating greens, which challenged even the best championship caliber players.   As a testament to his architectural brilliance, even today, Donald Ross course designs account for 11 of Golf Digest's 100 Greatest Courses in the United States. Our historic restoration, led by noted golf architect Lee Schmidt, and in collaboration with The Donald Ross Society, showcases Mr. Ross' brilliant architecture, returning The Donald Ross Course at French Lick to national prominence                         The Donald Ross Course at French Lick.

OUR OVERRIDDING GOALS     To recruit and retain a diverse staff that supports the various needs of our student-athlete population, within the university and surrounding community.   To sponsor numerous and varied varsity, intramural, club, and recreational programs that satisfy student interests and afford maximum participation by students and staff.    To initiate and support workshops, hiring practices, and operating procedures that focus not only on efficiency of intercollegiate athletic programming but focus on sustaining an inclusive environment.                                    Printer-friendly format        Email this article                                                                             01/11/09 - Women's Basketball vs. Indiana     01/10/09 - Women's Gymnastics vs. Pitt     01/10/09 - Men's Gymnastics vs. Army     01/06/09 - Men's Basketball vs. Purdue     01/04/09 - Wrestling vs. Lehigh & Lock Haven     11/22/08 - Football vs. Michigan State                                                                                                        Penn State University Athletics                                                                                       BNET   |    CBS College Sports   |    CBS Radio   |    CBS.com   |    CBSNews.com   |    CBSSports.com   |    CHOW   |    CNET   |    CNET Content Solutions   |    GameSpot   |    International   |    Last.fm   |    Metacritic.com   |    Moblogic   |    MP3.com   |    mySimon   |    NCAA   |    Search.com   |    Shopper.com   |    TechRepublic   |    The Insider   |    TV.com   |    UrbanBaby.com   |    UWIRE   |    Wallstrip   |    ZDNet   |                             © 2009 CBS Interactive.

(How did this happen you ask?  Each Regoinal Women's Tour has a Tour Champion at the end of the year (the player ranked highest at the end of the year) - that person get a spot into each WPBA event of the following year.  Lisa Marr has the title (she earned the most points) but she declined on the spots.  Next in line was Heather but she is not eligible b/c she has an exempt status now (see above) for 2009.  Amanda was next but passed on the spots and next was Bonnie who accepted the spots.)                                                                                                         ...Bios...

I wish all my teammates the best in the future and will always consider them my teammates. As for me, I will be back and stronger than ever.........you haven't seen the last of me.    While the chapter of my racing career with Redline is closed, I look forward to beginning a new chapter with a new sponsor. I would like to thank my sponsors that have shown their continued support, VISA, Nike, Kronik, Lizard Skins and Inustrial. To all the Bubba Harris fans, I look forward to seeing you at the track very soon. I know this experience will make me a better person and BMXer in the future.""

[ 7 ]   He is a 2003, [ 7 ]  '04, '05, '07 ABA  BMXer  magazine Golden Crank winner for Professional of the Year.   He is a 2003, '04, & '05  BMX Plus!  Pro of the Year.   In 2004 Harris became the youngest racer to hold an ABA professional title, becoming ABA No.1 Pro in the 20"" class at the age of 18. [ 12 ]   He has become only the second rider in BMX history, and the first in the ABA, to win the Senior Pro 20"" class three consecutive times winning the ""AA"" pro class title in 2004, 2005, and 2006, tying  Terry Tenette . Terry Tenette was the first pro racer to do so in 1990,'91 & '92 in the National Bicycle League ""A"" Pro (Elite Men) class. Other three consecutive title wins have occurred in other classes in the past.  Brent Patterson  did it prior in the NBL Pro Cruiser class in 1981,'82 & '83 and  Cheri Elliott  in the ABA's girls amateur 20"" division in 1983,'84 & '85. Other racers have done it and exceeded it in other classes since.  John Purse  came close to doing it in 1997 after winning the title with the NBL in 1995 and 1996 but a crash in the NBL Grand National semi finals ended his bid for a "" three-peat "". [ 13 ]  Terry Tenette was still the only one to have done it in 20"" Men's Senior Pro until 2006. Bubba Harris would had made it four in a row breaking Tenette's record if he took the 20"" AA pro title again in the ABA racing circuit in 2007. However while in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics he suffered an ankle injury in  Beijing, China  on August 20, 2007 that took him out of the running to accomplish that feat. [ 14 ] .       [ edit ]   Significant injuries     Fractured his arm at the ABA Lonestar Nationals in  Beaumont, Texas  on March 5, 2000 after going two years without an injury. He was laid up for approximately three weeks until the weekend of March 26 of the ABA Winternationals in  Phoenix, Arizona . [ 15 ]   Fractured shoulder at the Nellis Silver state NBL/UCI National race in  Nellis, Nevada  on March 26, 2006. Was laid up for seven weeks until the ABA Dixieland Nationals in  Marietta, Georgia  on May 20, 2006. [ 16 ]   Suffered a separated shoulder at the UCI national in  Las Vegas, Nevada . [ 17 ]   Suffered a jammed elbow at the UCI Supercross time trials on September 7, 2006 in  San Jose, California . [ 18 ]   Exactly one year to the day BMX competition was to start in the 2008 Olympic Games in  Beijing, China , he completely dislocated the left ankle at the  talus bone  on August 20, 2007 in Beijing, China on the official Olympic track during his first run of his Time Trial. Coming out of the second turn he took an extra two pedals before setting up for the jumps. This did not leave him enough time to make the transition smoothly. He hit the first jump of the rhythm section and his right foot became unclipped from that pedal. He hit two successive jumps essentially one footed, his still clipped in left foot taking the weight. [ 2 ]  He hit a fourth successive jump slightly obliquely and was launched sideways by his momentum into the air, coming down on the back side of a jump with his left foot still clipped into an SPD pedal. It was twisted at approximately a 90 degree angle from its proper position. [ 2 ]  Doctors almost amputated his foot. After three months of recuperation, he attempted to race the 2007 ABA Grandnationals but reinjured the injury slightly in practice and sat out the Grands. He did race the NBL Christmas Classic on December 27, 2007 but didn't make the mains. Despite the constant pain he is in even just walking, he put off surgery on it to remove bone splinters to speed his recovery in time for the 2008 Olympics. [ 2 ]  In defiance of the pain, he was able to do relatively well during the 2008 racing season, including winning the Elite Men class at the NBL National in  West Palm Beach, Florida  on March 16, 2008. [ 19 ]       Still maintaining Olympic hopes he was in training for the Summer Olympics at a track at the Olympic Training Center in  Chula Vista, California . His Olympic dreams for making the 2008 team came to an end when he broke his right ankle in practice for the Olympic Trials on June 12, 2008. [ 20 ]  Ironically, the training track is an exact replica of the Olympic BMX track that the BMX events for the Beijing Olympics would be held on. His crash was on the second straight. He had hoped that it was a bad sprain but the next day doctors confirmed the break and Harris withdrew his name from the Time Trial competition leaving only seven competitors. [ 21 ]  On June 14, 2008 Harris saw his good friend Mike Day win the Olympic team Qualifying Trials and qualified for a sure slot on the USA BMX Olympic Team. He was cheering him on straight through. A few days after the Trials Harris had surgery to remove some of the floating bone chips left over in his left ankle from his severe August 20, 2007 dislocation. Harris intends to return to racing late August 2008 (ironically at approximately the same time the BMX events are scheduled to start in the Olympics) and stay in contention for the 2008 ABA pro title. [ 19 ]       Harris suffered from cracked ribs after a crash at the ABA Silver Dollar Nationals in  Reno, Nevada  on the weekend of January 11, 2009. He reportedly fell on his handlebars when he crashed. [ 22 ]       [ edit ]   Racing habits and traits     [ edit ]   Miscellaneous     [ edit ]   Post BMX career     Still active.

She had a four year annual first main crash streak during the ABA Grand Nationals until the 2006 edition in which she not only didn't crash in the first main, but was the Grand National winner.

(September 2008)         She good-naturedly jokes about her diminutive stature.

[ 14 ]  However her Olympic bid ended when she failed to make it out of the qualifying rounds at the UCI World Championships in  Taiyuan, China .  Jill Kintner  qualified as the United States sole female BMX Olympic participant. [ 8 ]  She finished out the 2008 season but suffering from injuries sustained in crashes. On December 3, 2008 she had surgery on an injured shoulder incurred in a crash. However, she fully intends to keep racing after recovering from her surgery and rehabilitation. She also intends to compete in the  2012 Summer Olympics  in  London, England . As she said in a December 29, 2008 post in Vintagebmx.com under her screen name of Redlinegirlkh:       I just had surgery on Dec 3rd and I WILL be back. Don't count me out for 2012 because I have the experience from this past year and I know what it takes to be a champion.

For other uses, see  Try (disambiguation) .           Shaun Perry  scoring a try for England against the  All Blacks       A  try  is the major way of scoring points in  rugby league  and  rugby union . A try is scored by  grounding the ball  in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area (see next section).   The term  try  comes from  try at goal , signifying that originally, grounding the ball only gave the opportunity to try to score with a kick at goal. [ 1 ]   A try is analogous to a  touchdown  in  American  and  Canadian football , with the major difference being that a try requires the ball be simultaneously touching the ground in the in-goal area and an attacking player who is in the field of play or in-goal. (Oddly enough, the official name of the  extra point  in American football according to NFL rules is the try.) In the laws of both forms of rugby, the term  touch down  formally refers only to grounding the ball by the defensive team in their in-goal. Although occasionally people refer to a try as a 'touchdown', the correct usage for the action is 'grounding the ball'.           Contents       1   Scoring a try     1.1   Aspects common to both union and league   1.2   Variations specific to rugby union   1.3   Variations specific to rugby league       2   Point value   3   Penalty try   4   Conversion   5   Past to present   6   See also   7   References                 Scoring a try       Aspects common to both union and league   There are differences in the fine detail of the laws and their interpretation between the two rugby codes. These are the common aspects, while the differences are treated below.     The player holding the ball to score a try and the ball itself must not be in touch or touch-in-goal (including on or over the dead ball line). The touchline, touch-in-goal lines and dead ball lines count as being 'out'. There has to be contact with the ground or corner flag by a player or the ball for it to be ruled in touch or touch-in-goal. Parts of the body in the air above the lines and outside the field of play or in-goal are not touch, and it is common to see players who are partly in the air over the lines still ground the ball successfully.   The in-goal area in which the ball must be grounded includes the goal line but not the touch-in-goal and dead ball lines.   Grounding the ball in both codes means either holding it and touching it to the ground in-goal, or placing hand, arm or front of body between waist and neck (the front torso) on top of the ball which is on the ground in-goal.   A player does not need to be holding the ball to ground it. If the ball is on the ground or just above it, it can be touched to the ground with a hand, arm or front torso. Match officials interpret dropping the ball in-goal as a knock-on, and disallow a try. For a try to be awarded they consider whether the player had the intention to ground the ball and the control of it when they did. Grounding of the ball can be instantaneous, it does not matter if the player immediately lets go and the ball then bounces forward.   An attacking player who falls to the ground before reaching the goal line scores a try if momentum carries the player so that the ball touches the in-goal including the goal line.         Variations specific to rugby union     A player may ground the ball in one of two ways: if the ball is held in the hand(s) or arm(s), merely touching the ball to the ground in-goal suffices and no downward pressure is required; if the ball is on the ground in-goal, downward pressure from the hand(s), arm(s) or upper body (waist to neck) is required. For a try to be awarded, an attacking player must ground the ball before a defender does so. If there is doubt about which team first grounded the ball, the attacking team are awarded a 5-metre scrum.   A player who is in touch or touch-in-goal, but who is not carrying the ball, may score a try by grounding the ball in-goal.   The goal-posts and padding at ground level are part of the goal line and therefore of the in-goal, so a try may be scored by grounding the ball at the foot of the posts.   A player may ground the ball in a scrum as soon as the ball reaches or crosses the goal line.   If an attacking player is tackled short of the goal-line but immediately reaches out and places the ball on or over the goal-line, a try is scored.   If a television match official (TMO, or video referee) has been appointed, the referee may ask for advice before deciding whether to award a try, but under current protocols the TMO may only advise on whether the ball was properly grounded, on whether the ball or ball-carrier went into touch or touch-in-goal in the act of scoring, and on any foul play that may have occurred.         Variations specific to rugby league     The laws of rugby league still refer to the need for ""downward pressure"" to be exerted in grounding the ball with hand or arm.   The laws of rugby league specify that a try is scored if an attacker grounds the ball simultaneously with a defender.   An attacking player falling to ground whose momentum does not allow the ball to reach the in-goal may  not  reach out and place the ball in-goal to score a try; this is disallowed by interpretation as a ""double movement"".   The goal posts and padding are not part of the goal line.   Players who are in touch-in-goal and not carrying the ball may  not  score a try by pressing a loose ball still in play to the ground.   A try may not be scored in a scrum which crosses the goal line, but when the ball comes out of scrum a player may pick it up and 'bore through' their own scrum to score a try.   Video referees in rugby league are given a wider scope to look at the validity of a try and if the video is inconclusive, the decision is sent back to the referee (""ref's call""). Referees often give the benefit of the doubt in favour of the attacking team in such cases.         Point value   In rugby league, a try is worth four points, having been this case since 1983. Before that, a try was worth three points. In rugby union, a try is worth five points; this point value having  varied  over time. Although a try is worth less in rugby league, it is more often the main method of scoring due to the much smaller value of  goals . In rugby union, however, there is heavy reliance placed on significant value of goals to accumulate points.       Penalty try   In both rugby league and in rugby union, if the referee believes that a try has been prevented by the defending team's misconduct, he may award the attacking team a  penalty try . Penalty tries are always awarded under the posts regardless of where the offence took place. In rugby union, the standard applied by the referee is that a try ""probably"" would have been scored. The referee does not have to be certain a try would have been scored. In rugby league, the referee ""may award a penalty try if, in his opinion, a try would have been scored but for the unfair play of the defending team."" [ 2 ]       Conversion           Scott Daruda  kicking a conversion for the  Western Force       In both codes when a try is scored, the scoring team gets to attempt a  conversion , which is a kick at goal to convert the try from one set of points into another larger set of points. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try, and parallel to the  touch-lines . This is so the kicker can position the ball in a more advantageous position to increase the chance of scoring. If successful, additional points are scored. For the conversion to be successful the ball must pass  over  the crossbar and between the uprights. This kick at conversion in rugby union may take place as either a place kick (from the ground) or a  drop kick  whereas in rugby league, a conversion may only take place as a place kick. Note, however, that in both  rugby sevens  (usually, but not always, played under union rules) and  rugby league nines , conversions may only take place as drop kicks.   To make the conversion easier, attacking players will try to ground the ball as close to the centre of the in goal area as possible. The attacking player will however ground the ball when confronted by a defender rather than risk losing the ball by being tackled or passing it to a teammate.   In both rugby union and rugby league a conversion is worth two points; a successful kick at goal thus converts a five-point try to seven for rugby union, and a four-point try to six for rugby league.       Past to present   In early forms of rugby football the point of the game was to score  goals . A try was awarded for a touch down behind the posts; It had zero value itself, but allowed the team that touched down to  try  to kick at goal without interference from the other team. This kick, if successful, would  convert  a  try  into a  goal .   Modern rugby and all derived forms now favour the try or touch down in place of goals and thus the try has a definite value, which has increased over time and now eclipses the value of a goal. In rugby league and rugby union, a conversion attempt is still given, but is simply seen as adding extra 'bonus' points. These points however can mean the difference between winning or losing a match, so thought is given to fielding players with good goal-kicking skill.
