Best known as a caterer, gardener and decorator who became a major force in media, including the founder of a major corporation, Martha Stewart had an earlier career in financial services that laid the groundwork for much of her future success.    Biography:  Born Martha Helen Kostyra in Jersey City, NJ in 1941, she grew up in nearby Nutley, NJ. While a student at Barnard College (the women's division of Columbia University), she married a law student named Andrew Stewart in 1961. Martha Stewart graduated in 1963 with a BA in European history and architectural history.    In 1965, Martha Stewart began a career in New York as what was then commonly called a stockbroker or account executive ( financial advisor  today). In the same year, she gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Alexis. By most accounts, she was highly successful, building up a large  book of business  and becoming a very high earner. This was especially noteworthy in an era when opportunities for women as financial advisors were few, due to the mutually-reinforcing skepticism of clients (men and women alike) and reluctance of employers.    In 1972, she left her  Wall Street  job when her family relocated to the Connecticut suburbs. Here she soon gained expertise in home restoration, decoration and gardening. In 1976, she co-founded a catering business. Its success, especially with wealthy and influential clients, led to books, merchandising, a magazine, a TV program, and a major corporation with her as chairman and CEO. In 1999, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, making Martha Stewart herself briefly a billionaire.    In 2004, Martha Stewart was convicted of illegal insider trading, based on a 2001 sale of 4,000 shares of stock in ImClone Systems, a company led by a friend named Samuel Waksal. Heavy fines, five months in prison and five months in home detention followed. Ironically, her financial gain from the trade was trivial, especially relative to her own significant wealth: $45,673 is an oft-cited estimate. Despite the disgrace and ridicule she incurred as a result of this episode, her career has largely recovered.    Lessons:  Martha Stewart is yet another example of someone using success in a financial services career as a steppingstone to other achievements. Her earnings as a financial advisor financed her relocation to an expensive suburb which, in turn, sparked the launch of her even more successful second career. Also, her years as a financial advisor taught her valuable lessons about money and markets, as well as in the art of persuasion: she chose a field that was distinctinctly unwelcoming to women, yet succeeded.    On the other hand, the Martha Stewart story is a cautionary tale about how even smart, savvy people can overreach, making foolishly high-risk, low-reward decisions. Such was the insider trading scandal. The small financial gains were not worth the risks, as subsequent events proved. She should have known that, as a high profile celebrity, she would be a target for prosecutors looking to make examples and send messages. Moreover, her prior experience as a financial advisor meant that she was even more aware of insider trading restrictions than the average CEO, and thus could not seek leniency on account of ignorance.    Lastly, there is the related case of her financial advisor during the time of the ImClone scandal, Peter Bacanovic. He had been highly successful in cultivating  high net worth clients , especially the sort whose lives revolve around elegant parties, the theater, the opera, the symphony, art galleries and/or expensive restaurants. Whatever his prowess in investing money, Bacanovic was a master at entertaining clients and prospects from this lofty social milieu, and owed most of his success to his social graces and connections.    Through his knowing complicity with Martha Stewart's illegal trade, Bacanovic lost his lucrative position at Merrill Lynch, paid a hefty fine (roughly four times the amount of hers), endured identical periods of incarceration and home detention, and is banned for life from working in the securities industry. Financial professionals should note the dangers of skirting legal or ethical standards to mollify an important client, whether on their own initiative or under pressure from their superiors. In the long run, it often is best to just say no.             Related Articles Martha Stewart – Biography – About Martha SIRIUS Satellite Radio And Martha Stewart Will Launch 24/7 Channel For Wome...

Order Your Copy 7 Steps to an  Organized Wedding  Thank You Note • Home Organization • Paper/Filing Systems • Time Management Stacey Agin Murray  has been organized since her months in the womb. Her mother thought ‘the baby was kicking’ but in reality, Stacey was searching for a place to store some excess umbilical cord...  After her time in-utero, Stacey moved in to a similarly tight space. Out of necessity and curiosity, her  5’ x 12’ bedroom became an ‘Organizing Laboratory.’ She quickly learned to think ‘upward’ instead of ‘outward’ and  with tape measure in hand, analyzed and organized her precious inches  of space. Let’s just say, if Stacey lived near The Container Store as a teenager, her babysitting money would have been spent on helper shelves and drawer dividers...   Careers as a graphic designer, editor, and elementary school teacher as well as time spent in her ‘bedroom/laboratory’ provided the foundation for Stacey’s work as a Professional Organizer. Looking back, Stacey realizes that being organized has given her the opportunity to  live a full, productive and less-stressful life.  Organized  Artistry  was born out of the desire to help others achieve the feelings of freedom, preparedness, and calm Stacey experiences  from being organized. Stacey’s formal education includes  a B.A. in Art from SUNY-Binghamton and an M.A. in Art Education from Teachers  College, Columbia University. She is a member of the National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO), NAPO's Golden Circle, the New Jersey Association of Women's Business Owners, (NJAWBO) and authored the 'Organizing on a Shoestring' column for  Organize Magazine .   Click here  to request  Organized  Artistry's   FREE  e-list of  'Top Ten Tips for  Organized Living.'     HOME ABOUT STACEY SERVICES BRIDES & GROOMS MONTHLY ARTICLE ARTICLE ARCHIVE MEDIA ROOM RESOURCES   Currently serving  Northern New Jersey   Copyright c. 2002-2009 Organized Artistry, LLC All Rights Reserved.

Activist investor Carl Icahn has been searching for a higher bid.        The biotech company, which last week rejected an unsolicited offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb to acquire it for $5.4 billion, is expected to announce a deadline by which it hopes to have a deal with its other suitor. The two sides remain in eep discussionsaccording to the WSJ, and they believe they can reach a solution within the next few days.        ImClone has also expressed interest in exploring possible deals with Pfizer and Eli Lilly.        ImClone chairman Carl Icahn called the revised offer from Bristol from $60-per-share to $62-per-share bsurd.He mocked Bristol CEO James M. Cornelius for making it.        ""If you wish to make your attorneys wealthier, I can show you more productive ways to do so,"" Icahn wrote in an open letter. ""Or, if you simply want publicity, I can also help you in that regard without your having to make unnecessary expenditures.""

In years past, there used to be these] pictures of little girls, and they had these big saucer-shaped eyes,” he says, producing quick strokes, “and… I used to try and draw them all the time, and I’d put in all the designs in the dresses.

The museum, which opened in 1991, is a small house museum that was the former home of Miss Lucy Craft Laney.        The museum is located in the Historic Laney-Walker District, near the original site of the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute. The mission of the Lucy Craft Laney Museum of Black History is to promote the legacy of Ms. Lucy Craft Laney through arts and history.                  We accomplish this awesome task by educating and exposing children and adults of the CSRA, the State and beyond to the arts, history, literature and leadership through exhibits and programs.                           The Preservation of a Legacy      Ms. Laney dedicated her life to providing educational opportunities for Black youth in the Augusta area. Ms. Laney was the founder of the Haines Normal and Industrial Institute which was located on the present site of the Lucy Laney Comprehensive High School. She started the first kindergarten for Black children in Augusta and founded the Lamar School of Nursing for black women.             The Lucy Laney High School, Laney Walker Boulevard (formerly Gwinnett Street) and the Laney Walker North Historic District have all been named in Ms. Laney's honor.

The checks they send are forged!           These pages carry a sizeable list of the names and titles attached to some of the criminally motivated junk mail you may have received.     The criminals invent new identities    every day but many of them use the techniques described here. Well done, you were right to be suspicious!!         This page:  The fake job    fraud ,    see also    Internet fraud update  ,    The money laundering fraud ,    Fraudsters haunting dating/matchmaking websites     ,  The fake loan offer fraud  and  the    bank accounts they use .          NB: Many victims seem to have been contacted by    the scammers as a result of them putting up a CV at sites like Monster.com,    Totaljobs.com and    Careerbuilder.com. BUT - Monster.com have pointed out that the scammers    often use the Monster name to add credibility to their fraudulent offers. The    use of a Monster address in a fraud mail may simply indicate an attempt at    deception. The criminals often use the titles of genuine    companies in their scam mailings. Some will appear below, but of course these    companies have no relationship with the scammers, they are just another    category of victim.           The criminals will also place fake job    advertisements in local newspapers. If you become aware of these, please    complain to the newspapers. You can let them know that they will probably not    get paid for the space.

clueweb09-en0000-14-10279	                        danceviewnewyork           writers on dancing         The          DanceView Times, New York edition                              Remembering          a Hoofer           An          Interview with Donald O'Connor                   By Mindy Aloff             Copyright ©2003 by Mindy Aloff         In          1979, Donald O’Connor visited Portland, Oregon, as the guest star          in a lavish high-school production of  The Music Man.  It was my          understanding at the time that he was beginning to ease his way back into          stage performing after a hiatus of many years. As the dance critic for           Fresh Weekly,  the arts and entertainment section of Portland’s          Willamette Week, I asked to interview him. I knew nothing whatsoever about          his personal life then, and I know now only what I’ve read in the          various obits that were published following his death last month, on September          27th. What I knew, partially, were his movies and his television work.          I considered him then, and I still do, one of the finest all-around dancers          ever to perform in front of a Hollywood camera. He had style, speed, lightness,          elegance, rhythmic wit; he partnered his female co-stars with respect          and charm; his line readings were understated and droll; and, unusual          for many male Hollywood dancers apart from Fred Astaire, O’Connor          learned to care about port de bras: during the 1940s and ‘50s, he          visualized his entire dancing figure in the frame and paid attention to          how his entire body would read on the screen. Gene Kelly, his collaborator          and erstwhile nemesis, also cared about port de bras; however, despite          Kelly’s many sterling qualities, he couldn’t surpass O’Connor          in terms of allegro facility, offhanded elegance, or precision of stylistic          detail in complex footwork. (For anyone who would like to check this evaluation,          I’ve provided the O’Connor filmography that was published          with the interview.)          Most people          now associate O’Connor with his clown number, “Make ‘Em          Laugh,” in  Singin’ in the Rain;  however, that was          really a one-off. In his vintage movie dances he performed with female          partners, weaving in ballroom and tap steps, and his craft was not a matter          of broad clowning and brute acrobatics but rather of dry irony and technique          sweated out in studio rehearsals. As you’ll see from the interview—whose          text, aside from the correction of one printer’s error, is republished          below exactly as it appeared in 1979 (complete with my original bracketed          editorial explanations and my misspelling of Lucile Bremer’s name)—O’Connor          was also a bright man with an admirable sense of the older entertainers          from whom he learned. And—whether one should say “God bless          him” or “God pity him” for it—he was honest. This          interview, with its intense focus on dance traditions and technique, could          never be published in a U.S. newspaper today. Looking back on it, I’m          astonished and grateful that O’Connor took the hour and a-half to          speak to a complete nobody, and also that the editors of  Willamette          Week  opened their pages to his words.           –Mindy Aloff         Interview          with Donald O’Connor           Copyright © 1979 by Willamette Week          Republished by permission          There ought          to be a running club named after Donald O’Connor—a club with          high hopes. O’Connor is the guy who ran straight up three walls,          flipping backward to earth each time, in  Singin’ in the Rain,           and no matter how often you see the movie, the stunt still appears fresh,          magical and completely surprising. “Make ‘Em Laugh,”          O’Connor’s solo turn in that film, remains one of the treasures          of American comic dancing on the screen.          O’Connor          grew up in show business, the child of entertainers whose roots in the          theater and the circus go back for “a couple centuries” in          France (on his mother’s side) and Ireland (his father’s).          The entire family seemed to toss off physical dangers lightly. His father,          a strong man and an acrobat, had a well-known trampoline act in which          he launched himself over the backs of four elephants. At 3 months of age,          Donald was providing a hair-raising finale to the O’Connor vaudeville          appearances as the weight his older brother pitched across the footlights,          into another brother’s waiting arms.          In addition          to making audiences gasp and laugh, O’Connor has delighted them          with his dancing, on the stage, in films and on television. In Portland          to star in the St. Mary’s Academy production of  The Music Man           on television (see Week’s Worth for details), O’Connor talked          to us about this aspect of his career. Although his comic gifts, which          kept us chortling throughout the conversation, carry over into print,          his voice—breaking easily, surely and frequently into song—is          unreproducible.           Fresh Weekly:          How did vaudeville form you as a dancer?          Donald O’Connor:          Well, my legs are the same size; I’m still 5-foot-10—that’s          with heels. I started dancing when I was 13 months old. The first dance          I did was the Black Bottom, and I did the same routine for years in the          acts.          I’m          basically a hoofer, a tap dancer. I was always very good from the waist          down, moving with the feet, but I never had anything as far as line is          concerned until I worked with Bob Alton [choreographer for  I Love          Melvin  and  Call Me Madam] , Louis Da Pron  [Walking My          Baby Back Home]  and Gene Kelly. Then I became what’s known          as a total dancer, using the entire body in order to express what you          want to express in tap dancing and line.          My brothers          and my mother were all dancers, outside of whatever else they did, like          acrobatics, high-wire, trapeze. I was born in a circus. The reason I saw          more of vaudeville was that circuses were dying out at that time, starting          to combine. They couldn’t support themselves.          I grew up          in vaudeville. All the hoofers used to get together in a drugstore down          the street from the theater, or what-have-you, and if they knew a new          step they would teach it to you. I learned hoofing steps that way. But          going into ballet didn’t come until I made those pictures with Kelly.          FW: Gene          Kelly has said of you that you were a spontaneous artist who couldn’t          do the same thing twice.          O’Connor:          That’s true. That’s why I’m not a good choreographer:          I can’t remember what I put down. Kelly had two great people working          with him—Jeannie Coyne, who later became his wife, and Carol Haney,          who was absolutely magnificent. They helped him out.          I can picture          things, like a painter would, though I’m not good at painting, either.          But in terms of framing people, the basic idea for a routine, the continuity—that          I can do.          FW: Kelly          also said that it was difficult to set “Make ‘Em Laugh”          on you, because of your spontaneity.          O’Connor:          Through the years everyone takes credit for that number, and now I feel          that I had nothing to do with it. I don’t think I even performed          it. But this is how it actually came about.          Everyone          had a solo dance [in  Singin’ in the Rain ] but me. Kelly          thought we’d have to wind up the picture with a number similar to          “Moses Supposes” [a kind of challenge dance for Kelly and          O’Connor]. Then Roger Edens came in one day with this song, “Make          ‘Em Laugh,” a steal from Cole Porter’s “Be A Clown,”          from another picture with The Nicholas Brothers called  The Pirate           [1948, co-choreographed by, and starring, Kelly]. Kelly gave me the lead          sheet and said, “Why don’t you take Jeannie and Carol into          the small rehearsal hall and see what you can do with the number.”          Jeannie          and Carol, they were great laughers. And I had the funny bone. I’d          say hello in the morning and they’d break up. So we went in the          rehearsal hall, and I asked for a lot of props, and whatever they laughed          at the most, we wrote down. Kelly says he has his notes, that he’s          the one that put this thing together. Well, if he has notes they’re          Jeannie’s and Carol’s notes.          A friend          of mine, Phil Garris, saw this cockamamie dummy, without head, hands and          feet, and said, “Why don’t you use that?” I started          playing with it. The section with the dummy that you see came from an          actual experience in the subway where a guy tried to pick me up and put          his hand on my knee. So I used it: put the dummy’s hand on my knee,          and knock it away. Finally we start fighting in back of the couch.          Carol, Jeannie          and I started putting things into slots—this goes here, this goes          there. We made the number a traveling thing. If you recall, it’s          a traveling shot: the old silent-movie technique where they used to go          from one set to the other. In the old days, you might have four or five          different pictures being shot at the same time [in adjacent sets]. We          used that idea, traveling until the end where I run up one wall, do a          back somersault, run up another wall, do a back somersault and go through          a third wall. I had done that in two different pictures:  Feudin’,          Fussin’ and A Fightin’,  where I ran up a board in a barn,          and a pirate picture—incidentally, one of the worst pictures ever          made (I forget the name)—where I ran up a wall.          That’s          how the number came about. Kelly’s main contribution was his ability          to see something very good and to utilize it. And his only other contribution          was where I hit the wall and screw up my face. He thought that was very          funny. I didn’t. But he liked it and they kept it in. And it is          funny on the screen.          FW: How          long did it take you to block “Make ‘Em Laugh”?          O’Connor:          A day, maybe a day and a half. Going up the walls doing somersaults, that          trick took a couple of days. I had to practice that in a harness.          FW: You          said a moment ago that you were most pleased with your dancing in  Call          Me Madam.  Why?          O’Connor:          We did some beautiful numbers. The one with the castle all broken down,          and around the water, was beautiful music beautifully choreographed. Working          with Vera Ellen was such a joy. And there’s one they cut out [when          the movie is shown] on television. It had everything: a very fast two-person          number, tap dancing. If you see the picture in its entirety, you’ll          see it. That was, for me, my best dancing. As far as the best picture          is concerned,  There’s No Business Like Show Business.  For          crazy dancing, it’s interesting to see the old pictures I made with          Peggy Ryan before I went into the service. With the Jivin’ Jacks          and Jills. Bob Fosse was one of them, and Tommy Rall—I think the          greatest dancers living.          FW: Above          Astaire?          O’Connor:          Yes. And Kelly. You see, as far as the man’s personality goes, there’s          no one who can touch Fred Astaire. He’s unique. But for the work          he does, I would say Tommy can do it, Fosse can do it. Or at least they’re          able to fake it and come across with great charm. I’m talking about          overall dancers, who can do everything. And they’re great choreographers,          too.          FW: Do you          see any dancers of that ilk coming up in movies?          O’Connor:          I don’t get around that much any more. I saw a girl I think is just          fabulous in  Movie Movie.  But I haven’t seen pictures with          a lot of dancers:  West Side Story, Saturday Night Fever, Grease.          FW: In general,          do you think there’s a correlation between the way people dance          and what they expect to see on the screen or in the theater?          O’Connor:          Yes. What they’re doing now with disco is combining a lot of the          old steps and movements, like we did in the ‘40s. They’re          going back to the Shuffle, the Lindy, rhumbas, a little bit of Afro-Cuban.          It’s marvelous. Unfortunately, my body won’t move that way.          I’d love to do it myself; I get out and fake it. But it’s          pretty rotten.          FW: You’ve          had some fine partners in movies. How would you adjust your dancing in          those various partnerships?          O’Connor:          I don’t have very high extension. Vera Ellen would have to adjust          to my extension, if we wanted to be together in a particular step. If          she wanted to kick higher she could when it was called for, but she would          have to make adjustments to my line. Now, Mitzi Gaynor is the type of          dancer who must dance strong all the time. She’s great with a partner,          but she’s strong—more of a single dancer. You have to go the          other extreme and dance down a little bit in order to be cohesive. Let          her take it.          FW: Is there          one partner who stands out for you?          O’Connor:          Peggy Ryan, in those pictures of the old days. Then Vera and Mitzi. And          Janet Leigh. We made a picture called  Walking My Baby Back Home.           She hadn’t danced in years but was a real trouper. Nine times out          of 10 we’d do all those beautiful dance routines on cement, and          she got very tired, started falling a lot on her knees. And her knees          started to swell three times their normal size. It was very painful. On          the screen you can’t tell how she was suffering in that darn thing.          I would          have liked to have worked with Lucille Bremer, who did a couple of the          greatest numbers that’ve ever been on the screen, both with Astaire:          “Limehouse Blues” from  Ziegfeld Follies  [1946] and           Yolanda and the Thief  [1945], where they worked on a turntable          for “This Heart of Mine.” She was totally with her partner.          She complemented the man, even though she was a solo dancer; it looked          like a great romance. And she was a very beautiful girl. And of course          I never had the chance to work with Carol Haney, one of the finest dancers          I’ve ever seen, and the sexiest.          FW: Did          you dub your own taps in your pictures?          O’Connor:          Yes, and if I was too busy, Louis Da Pron would put them in. There’s          a distinct difference. You can tell, at least I can. He’s a heavier          dancer. Everyone has his own distinctive sound.          FW: While          you were growing up, did you get to see any of the well-known black hoofers          in the vaudeville circuit?          O’Connor:          Sure. Bert Williams; John Bubbles, of Buck and Bubbles; Hal Leroy, who          had the fastest feet in the world. Veloz and Yolanda did tricks that were          unbelievable. Will Mahoney, who danced on a xylophone. Pegleg Bates. I          understand he’s still dancing, and I think he’s in his 80s.          He had a tap put on his crutch. I know it sounds kooky, but it really          is magnificent to see him work. He uses the crutch for a beat, and offbeats          and syncopation. A very physical dancer. Now, Bill Robinson, who used          to dance up and down stairs, didn’t work like other dancers—the          Condos Brothers and so forth—with little stairs. He used stairs          that were four and a half, five feet high. Another very physical dancer,          with wonderful rhythm.          Many things          impressed me about these dancers: the timing, the endurance, the way they          put it over, the audience response, the style, the grace—the selling          of the dance.          We used          to work in two great black houses: Chicago’s Regal Theater, and          the Apollo Theater on 125th Street in New York.          FW: What          is a great house?          O’Connor:          You have a feeling that everybody wants to be entertained. They don’t          go in as critics. They have an open mind, a willingness to accept. They          generate enthusiasm; it permeates the place. Once you get those vibes          you put out so much more. Remember, if you do the same act for 20, 30          years it gets a little boring unless you’ve got something else going          for you.           And the          orchestra really kept you going. They’d laugh at all your jokes,          even if they’d been hearing them for the last 30 years. They’d          get in there and work right with you: you’d show them your music,          they’d sniff it and they could play it. They used to make you come          alive. Even if you fell down they’d bring you up. And if you had          a good audience, they’d bring you up more. And if your act was any          good, and you worked hard, everything was working then.          It was so          ingrained, being in front of an audience, that if something was inherently          funny in a movie scene, I’d automatically wait for a laugh.          FW: What          makes dancing funny?          O’Connor:          Legomania, the way a person moves his legs like a chicken to music. Pratfalls          are always funny. A performer has to answer to himself. If you think something’s          funny, you’ve got to go out there and try. It’s only by trial          and error that you find out.          That is          the godawful thing about television today. Performers don’t have          any place to hit and miss. You’re either in or you’re out;          you don’t have a chance to become good at your craft. If you make          three pictures in a row and they don’t go over, you’re out          of the business. On television, I’ll give it twice.          But it’s          the ability to make mistakes that makes a tried-and-true performer. When          I was on  The Colgate Comedy Hour  [in the early 1950s], I worked          with Eddie Cantor, Ed Wynn—one of the greatest comedians and actors          that ever lived—and Jimmy Durante. You can’t ask for better          than that. And it was great format. We had three and a half weeks to work          on a show. It was a family-style thing. We used to walk on when someone          was doing a handstand, crazy; we’d break them up. And it was great          because it was live. They couldn’t cut out the mistakes. And that’s          what audiences love.          One of the          funniest things I’ve ever seen was a TV show with Joseph Cotten,          Ethel Barrymore— Hallmark Hall of Fame,  I believe. A highly          dramatic show in which they shoot this guy and cover him with a rug. They          got the wrong camera, and you saw the corpse get up with the rug over          his head and walk off. In a bent position. It was marvelous. To hell with          what the show said; that was funny.         Donald O’Connor:          The complete footage         Sing          You Sinners  1938           Sons of the Legion  1938           Men With Wings  1938           Tom Sawyer, Detective  1938           Unmarried  1939           Death of a Champion  1939           Million Dollar Legs  1939           Night Work  1939           On Your Toes  1939           Beau Geste  1939           Private Buckaroo  1942           Give Out Sisters  1942           Get Hep to Love  1942           When Johnny Comes Marching Home  1942           Strictly in the Groove  1943           It Comes Up Big  1943           Mister Big  1943           Top Man  1943           Chip off the Old Block  1944           This Is the Life  1944           Follow the Boys  1944           The Merry Monahans  1944           Bowery to Broadway  1944           Patrick the Great  1945           Something in the Wind  1947           Are You with It?  1948           Feudin’, Fussin’ and A Fightin’  1948           Yes Sir, That’s My Baby  1949           Francis  1949           Curtain Call at Cactus Creek  1950           The Milkman  1950           Double Crossbones  1950           Francis Goes to the Races  1951           Singin’ in the Rain  1952           Francis Goes to West Point  1952           Call Me Madam  1953           I Love Melvin  1953           Francis Covers Big Town  1953           Walking My Baby Back Home  1953           Francis Joins the WACs  1954           There’s No Business Like Show Business  1954           Francis in the Navy  1955           Anything Goes  1956           The Buster Keaton Story  1957           Cry for Happy  1961           The Wonders of Aladdin  1961           That Funny Feeling  1965                    Originally          published:          www.danceviewtimes.com          Volume 1, Number 3          October 13, 2003           Copyright ©2003 by            Mindy Aloff                                                                                                                                      DanceViewTimes                                            Index                      of Reviews                       Index                      of Writers                       Back                      Issues                       About Us                       Links                       Sister                      Sites:                        DanceView                       Ballet Alert!

Twisted Sister’s Dee Snider  a man not exactly in the limelight  may have broken one of the biggest stories of the year, in an interview with Canada’s MuchMoreMusic network. The reformed  Led Zeppelin  have allegedly found a replacement for Robert Plant. And his name is Myles Kennedy.   Snider apparently knows this because he shares a manager with Robert Plant. Although we’re certain the manager takes Plant’s calls before Snider’s, the fellow did disclose a couple of nuggets. “[Led Zeppelin are] saying [to Plant]: ‘We’re all rehearsed, we’re ready to go, here’s a gazillion dollars on the table,’” Snider explained. “‘If you don’t do it, we’re going out with this kid. And he can sing the shit out of Zeppelin.’”   So far, Plant has remained adamant on the subject of another Zeppelin reunion, refusing to tour with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham - John Bonham’s son. After  last month’s rumours  that Led Zep were finding a new singer, Plant still  quashed hopes  that he would be persuaded to return. Nevertheless, Snider said, “[Zeppelin] hope that Robert, at the last minute, will go, ‘OK,’ and step in, before having the lead singer of Alter Bridge out with John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Jason Bonham.”   The mysterious Myles Kennedy is an American singer, best known as a member of 90s rock act Mayfield Four and then Alter Bridge  a group that is essentially Creed minus Scott Stapp. (Apparently Kennedy has lots of experience as a substitute frontman.) Wikipedia claims Kennedy has a four-octave vocal range and can hold a note for 22 seconds, both of which could be helpful in singing Stairway to Heaven.   And though Dee Snider may not be the most reliable source, his comments have been backed up by producer Kevin “The Caveman” Shirley, who worked on several Led Zeppelin and Jimmy Page albums. Writing in his  online diary  on September 23, Shirley mentioned “a very troubling rumour”.   “There is a singer from a Florida heavy metal band who is pretty close to becoming My-Fave-Band-Ever’s singer. As the old one has a separate happening career. I have to admit to shock, shock, shock.”   Shirley heard the rumour from Journey’s “new singer”, Arnel Pineda. “I don’t know what to think,” he wrote.   Kennedy, meanwhile, must be thinking: dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign!   Zep “totally over” says Page manager   If  Jimmy Page ’s manager knows what he’s talking about  and we’re not entirely convinced that he does  there won’t be a  Led Zeppelin -like reunion after all.   Q Prime’s Peter Mensch  who  told  Britain’s BBC 6 Music earlier this week that his guitar-playing client, bassist John Paul Jones and “Bonzo Junior” drummer Jason Bonham were auditioning singers to replace Robert Plant in anticipation of touring and recording  has now told MusicRadar.com that things have changed.   “Led Zeppelin are over! If you didn’t see them in 2007 [when they played a one-off reunion at London’s O2 Arena], you missed them. It’s done. I can’t be any clearer than that.”   Mensch acknowledged that the three musicians had auditioned vocalists after known ladies man (if banging a lot of groupies and dating Alannah Myles makes you a ladies man) Plant decided he’d rather spend time writing, recording and touring with bluegrass star Alison Krauss than his former rock cronies. But apparently no one could live up to the standard they were seeking.   “They tried out a few singers, but no one worked out,” said Mensch. “That was it.   “The whole thing is completely over now. There are absolutely no plans for them to continue. Zero. Frankly, I wish everybody would stop talking about it.”   If Mensch didn’t get fans’ hopes up in the first place, people might stop talking about it. And saying two different things to two different media outlets doesn’t really help things either.   So with Zeppelin now “completely over,” we bet Page must have some pretty interesting things on tap to occupy his time. How about it, Mr. Mensch?   “F— if I know,” he told MusicRadar. “I’m waiting to hear.”   With Mensch obviously so on top of things, will anyone be totally surprised if Page, Jones and Bonham announce next week that Chris Cornell, Myles Kennedy, Steven Tyler or, hell, even Will.i.am will replace Plant?   The Black Eyed Peas member remixed U2’s forthcoming “Magnificent,” and The Edge says Page’s guitar playing  inspired  songs on the Irish band’s imminent  No Line On The Horizon , so it all makes perfect sense. Or at least it probably would to  Kanye West .

Thanks Alex:   alex spotted this on the guardian.co.uk site and thought you should see it.           Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton dies   The lead guitarist with the legendary rock band has been found dead at his home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He was 60       Blog: Share your memories of Ron Asheton   Tim Jonze   Tuesday January 6 2009   guardian.co.uk           The Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton has been found dead at his home in Michigan. He was 60.       Police told Ann Arbor News that the musician may have been dead for several days before he was found. Although unconfirmed, initial signs indicate that Asheton died of a heart attack.       Asheton was one of the founding members of the Stooges, along with his brother Scott, bassist Dave Alexander and their charismatic frontman Iggy Pop. With Pop, Asheton helped write songs that would set the template for punk rock, including No Fun and I Wanna Be Your Dog. As befits a band from Ann Arbor, their music distilled the experience of being a bored suburban teen and bottled it as a furious and snarling sonic assault. Their feral take on rock’n'roll, full of feedback and clatter, was the perfect backdrop for Pop’s wild stage antics, another big influence for punk performers.       For the band’s third album, 1973’s Raw Power, Asheton became the band’s bassist, but when the Stooges reuinted in 2007 he was back playing lead guitar. Although not wildly succesful during their time, they accrued a cult status that led to them being celebrated as heroes for their successful re-formation. Along with some memorable shows, including a riotous performance at Glastonbury festival in 2007, during which organisers failed to quell a mass stage invasion, the band released an album of new material, The Weirdness. It was their first for over three decades.       The Stooges are currently in the running to be inducted into the 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, along with the likes of Chic, Metallica and Run DMC. Five artists will be chosen later this month.       Tributes for Asheton have been flooding in, including the following message from his bandmates: “We are shocked and shaken by the news of Ron’s death. He was a great friend, brother, musician, trooper. Irreplaceable. He will be missed. For all that knew him behind the facade of Mr Cool &amp; Quirky, he was a kind-hearted, genuine, warm person who always believed that people meant well even if they did not. As a musician Ron was The Guitar God, an idol to follow and inspire others. That is how he will be remembered by people who had a great pleasure to work with him, learn from him and share good and bad times with him. Iggy, Scott, Steve, Mike and Crew.”       Iggy Pop left the following personal statement: “I am in shock. He was my best friend.”                                                                       Comments (0)                  Dead Phish    jdawson |  Uncategorized  | Wednesday, January 7th, 2009             Found these photos last night while looking for something else.

The man was cordial to a point, but he couldn’t understand why I would write such things about Kinston.   He went on to say that Kinston was going down the tubes, that our economy was a joke, and there was no art or culture to be found.   Now if that guy can say that, then why can’t I write  this .

The Dead, as they’re known now, will kick off a tour April 12 in Greensboro, North Carolina.   Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart will be joined by keyboardist Jeff Chimenti and Allman Brothers Band guitarist Warren Haynes. Weir says, “We have a mind meld going on here and it would be a sin to let that just wither and die.” Hart adds, “A mind meld is a terrible thing to waste.”                                   Comments (3)           Next Page »    Buy Generic Viagra Professional Pills   Buy Generic Levitra 20 mg   Buy Generic Viagra Super Active Pills   Generic Viagra Pills   Buy Generic Cialis Super Active 20 mg   Buy Generic Cialis 10 mg   Tramadol Pills   Buy Generic Cialis Professional   Buy Generic Viagra Soft Tabs   Buy Generic Cialis Soft Tabs Pills   Buy Generic Soma Pills                                                                                                                                                      powered by                         Search:                          Web                        Site                                                            Advertising Info       View Today's Ads       Advertise with us        Place an Ad              Yellow Pages   Apartments   Attorneys   Auto Dealers   Auto Parts   Auto Repair   Beauty Salons   Car Rental   Dentists   Doctors   Flowers   Hotels   Insurance   Loans   Mortgages   Movers   Pizza   Realtors   Restaurants   Storage   Tax Preparation   Travel   Featured   More...                    Archives       Story Archive        Special Sections                 Reader Services        E-mail Alerts       Home Delivery       Online Subscription       Report a Problem       Request a Temporary Stop       Contact Us                   RSS Feeds       Submit Your Announcement       Newspapers in Education       Buy Free Press Photos                  Related Sites       Havelock       ENC Today       Jacksonville       New Bern        Topsail                 encGuides       encSHOWS       encMARKETPLACE       encMEDICAL        encNASCAR       encBRIDES       encOUTDOORS       encNIE       encYellowPages   Apartments   Attorneys   Auto Dealers   Auto Parts   Auto Repair   Beauty Salons   Car Rental   Dentists   Doctors   Flowers   Hotels   Insurance   Loans   Mortgages   Movers   Pizza   Realtors   Restaurants   Storage   Tax Preparation   Travel   Featured   More...        encWORSHIP       encDINING                     Copyright © 2008                 Contact Us  |          Privacy Policy  |          User Agreement  |          Local Businesses  |          Site Map                           Freedom Communications, Inc.

About PSB      Penguin Group (USA) is now bringing many of its award-winning and bestselling authors to audiences everywhere with its newest division, the Penguin Speakers Bureau (PSB). Please  read more about PSB here  or just have a look around this website!      Any questions or comments, please email us at                                                     Getting Started...     Q: Are all PSB speakers listed on your website?    A: Yes, all official PSB speakers are listed on our website. If you click on Speakers, you'll see our complete roster.     We also work with many other Penguin authors and professional speakers on individual requests. If you have someone in mind who you don't see listed on our Speakers page, please   . We are directly in touch with all Penguin authors, as their publisher, and can quickly gather information, including fees and availability, on those authors in a timely manner.     Additionally, we can help you find information very quickly on most professional speakers that aren't necessarily Penguin authors, using our extensive network of contacts in the professional speaking world.      Q: What costs are involved with booking a PSB speaker for a speaking engagement?     A: The organization booking the speaker is responsible for the speaker's fee and travel expenses associated with the engagement.    Our speakers' fees and travel requirements are specific to each speaker. If you'd like to request a certain speaker's fee and travel requirements, please    directly. Or, if you're working within a specific budget, we would be happy to suggest appropriate speakers for your event that meet those financial requirements.        Q: What does the speaker's fee include?     A: Generally, when you book a speaker for a speaking engagement, the speaker will deliver an hour-long lecture, stay for a Q&A session, and sign books after the engagement.    If you'd like them to stay for a dinner, luncheon, meeting, or anything else, please let us know. We can approach the speaker to find out if their schedule can accommodate the additional request.    If you need the speaker to stay for a significantly extended period of time, or to deliver more than one lecture, please    and we can review those requests on a case-by-case basis.         Once you've booked a speaker...     Q: Who handles travel arrangements? My organization, PSB, or the speaker?    A: We ask the sponsoring organization to book the speaker's lodging, when needed, and to provide or book transportation for the speaker in the event city. If the speaker is coming from out of town, PSB will book their flights or train tickets.     If you need help with any or all travel arrangements, or need to book all arrangements through your organization for any reason, we will do everything we can to accommodate those needs.       Q: Can PSB provide materials to help us promote our speaking engagement?     A: Absolutely. Please let us know what you need and we're happy to provide anything we have available- whether it's a speaker's photo, biography, book cover image etc. Just ask.          Q: Does PSB help facilitate book sales?     A: As soon as we schedule an event, we'll let our Penguin colleagues in event book sales know to contact you. The event sales department will carefully discuss your needs with you and can help arrange anything from bringing in a local bookstore to sell books at the event to shipping books directly to your organization if you're buying books for attendees.     There are a number of different ways you may want books provided to your attendees. PSB's  colleagues in event book sales will help you provide books at your event in a timely and cost-efficient manner.       Q: Can we video or audiotape the speaker's lecture?     A: Please    if you're interested in video or audiotaping the speaker's lecture. Often times the speaker will allow taping but it's best to let us know as soon as possible so we have the opportunity to get permission from the speaker.    Q: Can we communicate directly with a speaker before the engagement?     A: Most PSB speakers are open and willing to speak with an organization once they've been booked for a speaking engagement. PSB speakers always strive to deliver the most engaging and thought-provoking lecture possible. They realize speaking with someone at your organization prior to the engagement may help them finetune their lecture to address your attendees specifically.     Please    if you'd like to arrange a conference call with your speaker.     For any other questions at all, please contact us at 212.366.2271 or   . Thank you.
