GX035-31-15769904	EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS                                   Recent earthquakes on and near the Island of Hawaii,  1962-1985.          The Island of Hawaii experiences thousands of earthquakes each year; most are so small that they can only be detected by instruments, but some are strong enough to be felt, and a few cause minor-to-moderate damage. Most of Hawaii's earthquakes are directly related to volcanic activity and are caused by magma moving beneath the earth's surface. Earthquakes may occur before or during an eruption, or they may result from the underground movement of magma that comes close to the surface but does not erupt. A few of the island's earthquakes are less directly related to volcanism; these earthquakes originate in zones of structural weakness at the base of the volcanoes or deep within the earth beneath the island.    Strong earthquakes endanger people and property by shaking structures and by causing ground cracks, ground settling, and landslides. Strong earthquakes in Hawaii's past have destroyed buildings, water tanks, and bridges, and have disrupted water, sewer, and utility lines. Locally, such damage can be intensified where soft, water-saturated soils amplify earthquake ground motions. On steep slopes, such soils may fail during an earthquake, resulting in mudflows or landslides. An indirect hazard produced by some earthquakes is a tsunami, a large sea wave that can be far more damaging than any of the direct seismic hazards.    The size of an earthquake is commonly expressed by its magnitude on the Richter scale, which is a measure of the relative size of the earthquake wave recorded on seismographs. An increase of one whole number on the Richter scale  represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the seismograph recording. Earthquakes greater than about magnitude 3 usually can be felt by people near the source area, those greater than magnitude 5 are potentially damaging, and any earthquake of magnitude 7 or greater that occurs near populated areas is certain to cause widespread property damage.    The earthquakes directly associated with the movement of magma are concentrated beneath the island's active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa. Very shallow earthquakes frequently precede or accompany an eruption. Hundreds of such earthquakes make up swarms that commonly occur over a period of several hours or days before an eruption as magma forces its way into a new area. These earthquakes are seldom large enough to cause widespread damage, but they may produce extensive ground fracturing close to the potential eruption site. Once an eruption begins, the earthquakes usually diminish.    Other earthquakes beneath the active volcanoes are generated by the pressures exerted by magma that never reaches the surface. Kilauea's east rift zone is continually being wedged apart by the injection of new magma, much of which is stored underground deep within the rift zone. Since the north flank of Kilauea is immobilized by the adjacent mass of Mauna Loa, the south flank, which faces the ocean, must move outward to make room for the additional magma. Periodically, Kilauea's south flank abruptly shifts seaward in response to this pressure, causing earthquakes. Most such earthquakes are small, but a few are large and can cause damage.                              Generalized locations of damaging earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater since 1868 on the Island of Hawaii. The same earthquakes are listed in the accompanying table. The magnitudes marked by an (*) are based on eyewitness accounts of the earthquakes' effects and on reports of damage. Since about 1950, the accuracy of location, magnitude, and depth determinations has continually improved as the capability of seismic instruments has increased.                   Year     Date     Region     Magnitude     Depth (Mi)      1868    Mar. 28    Mauna Loa south flank     6.5-7.0*      No data      1868    Apr. 2   Mauna Loa south flank     7.5-8.1*     No data      1929    Oct. 5   Hualalai   6.5*       No data      1941    Sept. 25   Kaoiki    6.0*     No data      1950    May 29    Mauna Loa southwest rift     6.2     No data      1951    Apr. 22     Kilauea    6.3    20      1951    Aug. 21    Kona    6.9    5      1952    May 23    Kona    6.0        5      1954    Mar. 30    Kilauea south flank     6.5    5      1962    June 27   Kaoiki    6.1      6      1973    Apr. 26    Honomu    6.2    25      1975    Nov. 29    Kilauea south flank     7.2     6      1983    Nov. 16    Kaoiki    6.6     7      1989    June 25   Kilauea south flank     6.1    9              In 1975, Kilauea's south flank was the site of the magnitude 7.2 Kalapana earthquake, the highest magnitude event in this century. The Kalapana coast subsided as much as 11 feet, generating a huge tsunami that claimed two lives in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, destroyed houses in Punaluu, sank fishing boats in Keauhou Bay, and damaged boats and piers in Hilo. The most recent large earthquake on Kilauea's south flank occurred in June 1989. With a magnitude of 6.1, this quake caused much less damage than the 1975 event.

The Kealakekua fault zone on Hawaii's Kona coast was the site of an earthquake of about magnitude 6.9 in 1951 that may have been related to the 1950 eruption of Mauna Loa's southwest rift zone. The largest Hawaiian earthquake in recorded history occurred in 1868 beneath the Ka'u district on the southeast flank of Mauna Loa; it had an estimated magnitude of between 7.5 and 8.1. The 1868 earthquake caused damage across the entire island and was felt as far away as the Island of Kauai. The devastation was greatest in the Ka'u district, where an earthquake-triggered mudflow killed 31 people and coastal subsidence produced a tsunami that destroyed several villages. At least 79 people perished during this earthquake; most of these casualties resulted from the landslide and tsunami.   Earthquakes in the Kaoiki region, centered between Kilauea and Mauna Loa, are also thought to be related to stresses in the earth's crust that are produced by the activity of the two volcanoes. In the last half century, earthquakes with magnitudes from 5.5 to 6.6 have shaken the Kaoiki region about once every 10 years. The latest large earthquake in this area had a magnitude of 6.6 and occurred in 1983. This event caused substantial damage to structures in Ka'u, Puna, and North and South Hilo districts. Ground cracking and settling led to temporary road closures, and landslides occurred on steep slopes. The financial losses caused by the earthquake were estimated at $7 million. Fortunately, there were only minor injuries because the earthquake struck early in the morning when most people were still in bed.    Large earthquakes unrelated to volcanic activity also occur at irregular intervals on the Island of Hawaii. In 1973, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake located 25 miles beneath Honomu, north of Hilo, injured 11 people and caused $5.6 million worth of damage. Such earthquakes have no known recurrence interval and are difficult to predict.                      Hilo building damaged by the November 1983 Kaoiki earthquake.  (Photograph by J.M. Buchanan-Banks, USGS)           Defining hazard zones for the effects of earthquakes is more difficult than for eruptions and has not been attempted for the Island of Hawaii. For the most part, earthquakes on Hawaii are concentrated beneath Kilauea and Mauna Loa, particularly beneath the south flanks of both volcanoes, and in the Kaoiki region between them. The likelihood of a damaging earthquake on Kilauea or Mauna Loa probably increases with long-lived activity of the rift zones, but its precise time and magnitude are impossible to predict.    Small, non-damaging earthquakes will be felt more frequently by people living on the slopes of these volcanoes. The effects of a large earthquake under Kilauea or Mauna Loa, however, will not be limited to the immediate area and may cause damage over much of the island. Similarly, deep earthquakes, such as the 1973 Honomu earthquake, can take place under any part of the island and can produce damaging effects over a wide area.    One problem in assigning seismic hazard zones to the island is that the ground shaking during a strong earthquake may vary within a small area. This variation is because the effects of earthquakes are closely related to the nature of the underlying ground; for example, whether it is mainly lava bedrock or soil. Two homes in the same neighborhood may suffer different degrees of damage depending on the properties of the ground upon which they are built. In addition, local topography strongly affects earthquake hazards. Steep slopes composed of loose material may produce large landslides during an earthquake.    The risk from living in a seismically active area, unlike that of living in an area prone to being covered by lava, also depends to a large degree on the type of construction used in a given home. Earthquake shaking may damage certain types of houses, while leaving other types of construction unscathed. For all of these reasons, earthquake hazards are highly localized, and it is difficult to define broad zones with the same relative degree of hazard.

In 1997, there were 117 Flood/Flash Flood related fatalities, 14 less than 1996 and 7 more than the annual national average. Some notable flood/flash flood events: May 31, 1889  The Johnstown Flood claimed 2,209 lives when the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River was breached. Heavy rainfall contributed to the erosion of the earthen dam wall, which was 75 feet high and 900 feet long. Eventual failure of the dam occurred resulting in a wall of water (35-40 feet) to move through Johnstown. The lake was over 2 miles long, 1 mile wide and up to 100 feet deep. The flood resulted in 1600 homes lost, 280 businesses destroyed, and an estimated $17 million in property damage. In August 1969  114 fatalities occurred in Western Virginia during floods associated with Hurricane Camille. On June 9-10, 1972  237 fatalities occurred in Eastern South Dakota during flash floods. On August 1, 1976  Thunderstorms in the Rocky Mountains near Estes Park, Colorado, sent a 19-foot wall of water down the Big Thompson Canyon, killing 140 people. September 12, 1977  16 inches of rain fell in the Kansas City metropolitan area, causing a flash flood that killed 25 people and caused an estimated $90 Million dollars property damage. On June 14, 1990  In Shadyside, Ohio, 4 inches of rain fell in less than 2 hours resulting in a flash flood that caused 26 fatalities. December 1991  January 1992 - Up to 17 inches of rain fell in South-central Texas causing wide-spread river flooding on the Guadalupe, Brazos, Trinity, and Colorado Rivers accounting for 15 fatalities. Summer 1993  Persistent rains in the Mississippi River Valley caused major flooding of the Mississippi River and many of its tributaries. The floods resulted in 52 fatalities and an estimated $20 billion in damage. Nearly 50,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and more than 15 million acres of farmland were affected July 1994  Tropical Storm Alberto's torrential rainfall caused floods in central Georgia killing 32. January - March of 1995  Much of California experienced periods of heavy precipitation, causing floods which resulted in over $3 billion in damages and 27 fatalities. January 18-19, 1996  Large amounts of rain coupled with a rapidly melting snowpack resulted in flash floods that caused 30 deaths in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic US. March 1-7, 1997  Flooding of the Ohio River resulted in 33 deaths in the Ohio Valley.   57 Year List of Flood/Flash Flood Fatalities 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 60 47 68 107 33 91 28 55 62 48 93 51 54 40 55 302 42 82 47 25 169 93 53 41 142 188 56 53 57 1969 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 445 131 68 555 178 111 127 193 210 125 121 82 84 155 204 126 166 94 70 31 85 142 61 62 103 91 80 131 117 1997 fatalities by locations: 39% 38% 4% 6% 2% 8% 3% vehicle in or near a waterway permanent home mobile home boats or boating unknown/other camping  1997 fatalities by state: TX AZ KY CO CA MO OH WV TN NC NV PA 20 20 16 9 8 5 5 5 4 3 3 3 FL ND NM OK AR IA IL IN LA PR UT WA Total 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 117   National Summary of Lightning, 1997 Stuart Hinson and William Angel National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Environmental, Satellite, Data and Information Service National Climatic Data Center, Asheville, NC  There were 42 deaths contributed to lightning in 1997, 10 less than 1996, which is 53% below the annual national average of 90. A 46% increase of deaths in open areas such as parks and fields was reported while there was a 76% decrease in various/other unknown locations. This is most likely due to the increased accuracy in the definition of death/injury locations. There were 306 injuries reported in 1997, 10% above the annual average of 280. In 1997, Florida ranked number 1 in both lightning deaths with 8 (19%) and injuries with 55 (17.9%).

GX012-10-0664150	Introduction     It is a pleasure to address an audience that has had so much to do with the broad successes of GPS, not only in the field of earthquake research that I will discuss today, but across the whole range of military and civil applications of GPS.  I will concentrate on describing to you the interesting new applications within my field.    I would like to share with you some of the excitement among earth scientists about how GPS allows precise measurements of ground deformation. GPS allows us to measure the motions of earth's tectonic plates, and motions across fault systems. Moreover, we are now beginning to make GPS receivers an integral part of our network of instruments that record continuously, and monitor earthquake activity across the southern California region.    Beginning in 1990, a group of researchers mainly within the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC); including my colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Lab and at UCSD (Scripps), began trying to obtain funds from a variety of sources to start up an array of continuously recording GPS stations in southern California. I recall a special session at the American Geophysical Union less than 5 years ago today, at which several of us indicated a strong feeling that more continuous GPS stations would be the best way to vastly improve measurements of crustal deformation - at that time, it was considered preposterous to deploy even as many as 100 continuously operating GPS receivers in southern California.  We also recall one proposal after another being turned down, but we stuck with it. In retrospect, the receivers that were available in those days were not quite highly enough evolved to reliably provide good data, and there were still some problems with automating our analysis and management of the data. Through these early efforts, however, the network began to emerge.    On January 17, 1994, at 4:31 am, the Northridge earthquake did its part to remind southern Californians of the earthquake hazards we all live with, and to speed the development of our GPS monitoring system.  Since that earthquake, we have been successful in raising funds to implement a network of 250 GPS receivers across southern California. Although we are still only past the halfway mark in raising sufficient funds for this new experiment, the project of upgrading our existing 50 stations, and of installing the next 200 stations, is at hand. These stations will be deployed at the same time that the seismic monitoring network is also being upgraded with digital sensors and improved telemetry.    Across the Pacific in Japan, an even more ambitious deployment of GPS and seismic equipment is being undertaken, partly in response to the Kobe earthquake of January 17, 1995. Depending on the relative successes of these instrumental initiatives over the next several years, it seems likely that GPS will become as important to earthquake monitoring and research as seismographic instruments have been during the past century. We hope and expect to learn new things about the earth from the new GPS array, in the same way one might hope to learn something new about the universe when turning the latest new telescope skyward. And, when the next earthquake disaster strikes southern California, this new array will provide the information that emergency responders need in order to make well informed decisions.    I will describe;     the main uses of GPS in earthquake research today,     the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN), and     application of GPS to monitoring engineered structures.

The INEEL seismic network began in 1971 with a single station and evolved into a three-station network by October of 1972 for the purpose of developing a historical earthquake database. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s additional seismic stations were installed to improve earthquake monitoring of earthquake sources that may affect INEEL facilities. These sources include the volcanic rift zones within the eastern Snake River Plain, range-bounding faults along the southern portions of the Lost River Range, Lemhi Range, and Beaverhead Mountains, and background seismicity in the Intermountain Seismic Belt. Currently, the INEEL operates 27 seismic stations located throughout southeastern Idaho.   The INEEL accelerograph network began in 1973 when 11 strong-motion accelerographs were installed in buildings at the INEEL Site. Additional strong motion accelerographs were installed at the INEEL Site following the 1983 M 7.3 Borah Peak, Idaho earthquake and at seismic stations in 2002. At the INEEL Site, the strong-motion accelerographs are located within buildings at basement, floor and rooftop levels and outside of buildings at ground surface level (referred to as free-field sites).  The strong-motion accelerograph locations at the INEEL Site have been selected to provide information on the building, ground surface, and soil-building responses to strong ground motions of future large earthquakes. At seismic stations, three-component accelerometers were installed to record near-field acceleration data from small to large magnitude normal faulting earthquakes. The INEEL currently operates 31 strong-motion accelerographs.         INEEL seismic stations (red triangles) are located near potential sources of earthquakes such as range bounding faults and volcanic rift zones. Accelerometers (inverted red triangles) and continuous GPS receivers (yellow solid circles) are co-located at some INEEL seismic stations.        INEEL Seismic Station Instrumentation                A view to the southeast of seismic station Italian Canyon located along the Beaverhead fault.        The INEEL short-period seismic stations are composed of one or three seismometers. A single-component station has a vertically oriented seismometer that is either a Teledyne Geotech model S-13 or S-13 borehole Jr. Eleven stations within the eastern Snake River Plain have vertical seismometers located in 20-m (or 65 ft) deep boreholes. The remaining stations have vertical seismometers buried within 3 m (or 10 ft) of the ground surface near rock outcrops or set upon concrete pads affixed to rock outcrops. Five seismic stations have three-components, one vertically oriented sensor as described previously and two horizontally oriented Teledyne Geotech model S-13 seismometers located within concrete vaults. Additionally, six seismic stations have Applied MEMs Inc. model SF1500A tri-axial accelerometers (described below) and two have UNAVCO continuous recording GPS (Global Positioning System) (see  crustal deformation ) receivers collocated at them.   The seismic stations have DAQSystems NetDAS recording units with an embedded LINUX computer, a GPS clock and Symmetric Research 24 bit digitizer.    The NetDAS time stamps the seismic data with accuracies greater than 0.001 seconds. The seismic data are transmitted to the INEEL Research Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho using the FreeWave Technologies DGR115 900 MHz Wireless Modem. The wireless modem uses standard IP (Internet Protocol) networking features included in the embedded LINUX. INEEL uses both the 4 and 8 channel NetDAS recorders that boot from flash memory providing high reliability and low power consumption. NetDAS employs a highly efficient Generic Recording Format (GRF) that is interfaced with the U.S. Geological Surveys EARTHWORM data acquisition software. At the INEEL Research Center located in Idaho Falls, seismologists analyze the earthquake data using the SEISAN program.   INEEL Strong Motion Accelerographs                 Strong motion accelerograph located at the INEEL Research Center in Idaho Falls.      The 25 strong motion accelerographs at the INEEL Site consist of DAQSystems NetDAS four-channel recorders that contain Applied MEMs Inc. model SF1500A tri-axial accelerometers. The accelerographs are set to trigger at approximately 0.005 g. At some facility areas, several strong motion accelerographs are interconnected so that when one accelerograph is triggered, they all turn on to record earthquake data. Several strong motion accelerographs are also connected to phone lines providing quick access to acceleration data in the event of a large earthquake. The remaining accelerographs save the data on memory cards for INEEL personnel to retrieve. Acceleration data are analyzed using the SEISAN program that can produce both corrected and uncorrected acceleration, velocity and displacement time histories and amplitude spectra.   Earthquake Data Sharing     INEEL exchanges data in real-time with several nearby seismic networks using the U.S. Geological Surveys EARTHWORM program. INEEL records earthquake data from seismic stations owned and operated by BYU-Idaho in Rexburg, Idaho, Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology in Butte, Montana, the University of Utah Seismograph Stations in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado. INEEL also provides data from some its seismic stations to these seismic networks. Real-time data exchange with surrounding networks helps to fill in gaps between seismic networks and assists with determining more precise locations of earthquakes.

Clicking on a station code will take you to a plot of the north, east and up components  of the station as a function of time.    The station velocities are in an itrf97-NA-fixed reference frame. The reference frame is described more fully under the Summary Info button on each station page. See  gp processing . for more information about the processing. Please read disclaimer below.      Disclaimer:       Be advised that these results are preliminary.  The station positions are unchecked and should not be used for any engineering applications. There may be errors in the antenna heights.  The velocities are very dependent on the length of the span of observations.

GX061-01-2741202	Hazard Mapping     Table of Contents     Geologic Hazards              USGS Response to an Urban Earthquake -- Northridge '94       Communicating and Applying What We Have Learned   C ommunicating the scientific findings of the USGS and applying those findings to meaningful seismic-hazards reduction are multifaceted and long-term efforts. Com-municating the results ranges, for example, from providing raw data to researchers via the Internet to distributing highly interpreted seismic concepts to the general public. Applying the lessons learned from the earthquake ranges from changing laws and building codes to initiating long-term research and instrumentation programs in anticipation of future events. Some of these activities can be systematically planned and executed; others are highly experimental and must rely on ad hoc decisions and windows of opportunity for successful implementation. The USGS, however, has anticipated many communication and application needs of society, and has practiced and established its role in this regard since the inception of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) in 1977. The evolution of this role to date is partly encapsulated in this section through several examples of current communication and application techniques used by the USGS.     This Report   T his report is part of a multimedia approach for reporting USGS findings on the Northridge earthquake. The USGS processed in parallel (1) this printed document, (2) a replication of this document in electronic format, and (3) a hyperlinked Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) tour of USGS and related findings beginning at the Northridge Earthquake Home Page on the World Wide Web (WWW) (see p. 8). This multiphased, interconnected approach serves many functions which allow for a variety of views and levels of detail for readers with widely disparate interests and levels of scientific understanding.   The electronic copy of this report is contained in several Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) files. These files contain all text and illustrations seen in the printed report, and may be downloaded and printed using commonly accessible Internet protocols as well as viewed using Adobe Acrobat reader software. The PDF files are readily accessible through links from the Northridge Earthquake Home Page on the WWW.   The HTML tour of the Northridge earthquake investigations and findings is based on the outline of the printed report, yet the tour is not a linear process. An investigator may immediately link into any chapter or topical area from the Northridge Earthquake Home Page. The HTML tour also provides links to scientific documents such as articles for scientific journals, reference lists, fact sheets, and other materials that formed the basis for this project. Additionally, the HTML tour provides many links to earthquake-related topics beyond the scope of the Northridge earthquake project. The HTML tour is a “living” entity that will be updated and modified continually by the USGS as new information becomes available, or as obsolete materials are deleted.              Access this report via the WWW at: http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov              Upgrading the Seismic Instrumentation Network   A  major function of the USGS is to provide earthquake information quickly to other government agencies, emergency response organizations, utility companies, transportation entities, and others immediately affected by earthquakes. The USGS and Caltech have substantially improved seismic recording in southern California, and they have developed a program for continuing to upgrade the system to improve its reliability and speed of data transmission.   Specific goals of the instrumentation program are:       Recording and distributing ground-shaking information in near real time (within a few minutes of detection  of shaking) that can be used for estimating the extent and distribution of the resultant damages (see p. 72).   Maintaining the traditional functions of a strong-motion network; that is, onsite recording of strong shaking  (up to 2g) in the event of a telemetry failure.   Ensuring that the analysis system and telemetry are easily extended to include additional sensors, and are  able to readily interface with other regional seismic networks.   Ensuring that the network remains functional in the event of single-station failure.   Developing a pilot program on very rapid information transmission that can be used for early warning of strong  shaking.     The instrumentation program received startup funding through the NEHRP agreement (see p.4). Other funding sources include Pacific Bell Telephone for assistance in developing a telemetry system; the California OES through a proposal by Caltech and the CDMG; the NSF through a proposal by Caltech, and private funds raised by Caltech.   A USGS scientist kneels beside a portable seismograph station during the Northridge earthquake aftershock study. The site is a parking lot in front of the collapsed parking garage at California State University, Northridge.     Continuous GPS Monitoring   A  consortium of agencies (SCEC, USGS, and NASA) is currently installing a network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments throughout southern California. The network, named the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN), provides rapid, continuous measurements of ground deformation. As of April 1996, 38 stations were established, and there are plans for 30 more to be placed by the end of the year. Data have been collected from several stations that began operation in late summer 1994, and so far data quality has been excellent. The data are processed at the Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center (SOPAC) in La Jolla and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena primarily through funding by the USGS, NSF, and NASA. .   Continuously recorded GPS data have provided a new baseline for studying compression of the Earth’s crust across southern California. Displacements due to compression may prove to be indicators of stress accumulation on blind thrust faults similar to the fault that ruptured in the Northridge earthquake.   Continuous GPS Monitoring All of the current and archived GPS raw data from the network are available through several anonymous  FTP  (file-transfer protocol) sites on the Internet (see p. 8). The most recent results of the continuously operating GPS array are analyzed by the USGS and researchers at SOPAC and JPL.              GPS results may be viewed on any of several sites on the WWW that may be accessed through the following Uniform    Resource Locator (URL):  http://scec/gps.caltech.edu/scign.html              Speeding Earthquake Disaster Relief Using CUBE (Caltech/USGS Broadcast of Earthquakes)   S cientists and engineers from the USGS and other institutions and agencies aided emergency managers by preparing a shaking-intensity map for the Los Angeles area (see p. 55). This map showed estimated severity of shaking and the levels of damage likely associated with such shaking. This map was available long before a complete picture of the damage could be assembled, and it enabled emergency managers to promptly locate the hardest hit areas and to send appropriate help. The shaking-intensity map was the first use of such a map to help focus relief efforts during a disaster.   To quickly prepare accurate shaking-intensity maps after an earthquake, essential information about the location, size, and nature of the earthquake was compiled. A comprehensive broadcast system for reporting this essential information was established in 1991 in southern California. The broadcast system, called CUBE, automatically reports earthquakes recorded by the 350-station southern California seismograph network operated by the USGS and Caltech. (A companion seismograph network and broadcast system reports earthquakes in northern California; similar networks are located in other earthquake-prone areas of the United States.)   Whenever a sizable earthquake strikes, designated scientists are notified via telephone pager. Subscribers to the CUBE system, such as railroad companies, utility companies, and television stations, are also simultaneously notified. Instead of a telephone number, the location, size, depth, and other information about the earthquake scroll across the pager display. This information is fed into a computer-modeling system that incorporates geological conditions of an area. Scientists use the modeling system to calculate the shaking intensity for different locales within a large area surrounding the earthquake’s epicenter. Thus, rapid, reliable information from seismograph networks, until recently used primarily for research, is proving its value during earthquake disaster-relief operations.   These are the basic elements of the broadcast system that transmits information about earthquakes in southern and northern California. Energy from earthquakes is recorded at numerous field stations on instruments called seismographs. These seismic signals are relayed nearly instantaneously from this seismograph network to analysis centers at Caltech in Pasadena and at the USGS in Menlo Park. From these centers, earthquake information including time, location, and magnitude is relayed to designated scientists and to system subscribers via pager within 1 or 2 minutes of an earthquake. The information can also be displayed as a map on a personal computer.     Special Publications -- Magazines and Fact Sheets   D uring 1994-96, the USGS produced several specialty documents related to the Northridge earthquake. These included two issues of the USGS magazine Earthquakes & Volcanoes devoted entirely to early findings about the earthquake, and several fact sheets in the series Reducing Earthquake Losses Throughout the United States. Printed copies of Earthquakes & Volcanoes, v. 25, nos. 1-2, 1994, and the fact sheet series (1995-96) may be obtained from the USGS using the following contact:       USGS Information Services   Box 25286, Building 810   Denver Federal Center   Denver, CO 80225-0046 USA   Tel: 303-202-4200   URL:  http://www.usgs.gov                 The fact sheet series is also available on the WWW at the following URL:       http://quake.wr.usgs.gov              The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Knowledge Transfer Program   T he USGS actively supports and collaborates with SCEC (see p. 7) in its scientific and knowledge-transfer functions through membership on SCEC’s Board of Directors. SCEC’s Knowledge Transfer Program, funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), targets end users—the people and entities who make ultimate use of scientific data and interpretations. Specifically, these include disaster preparedness officials, practicing engineering design professionals, policy makers, southern California business communities and industries, local, State and Federal government agencies, the media, and the general public. Knowledge-transfer activities consist of forums and workshops, discussions among groups of end users and scientists, documenting and publishing these interactions, and developing products compatible with user needs. In 1994, the SCEC Board of Directors endorsed the concept for a Research Utilization Planning Process that focused on full scientific participation throughout the process and in implementing the plan. The process distinguished the end users that should be targeted for product development from the end users who need information, but not in the form of specialty products. SCEC is now working toward producing several reports for specific end-user groups such as property and casualty insurance underwriters, civil and structural engineers, engineering geologists, urban planners, and the general public. Examples of collaborative knowledge transfer between the USGS and SCEC include the handbook Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country (described below), and the Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE) (see p.19). The very nature and contents of these two ventures—one for the general public, one for scientific researchers—clearly illustrates the breadth of communications achievable by the USGS and its collaborators.              “Putting Down Roots in Earthquake County” can be inspected on the WWW at:       http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/roots/roothome.html       Results from The Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE) are frequently updated on the WWW at:       http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/larse.html              “Putting Down Roots in Earthquake Country” -- A Personal Handbook for Earthquake Safety   Part of the USGS effort to reach out to citizens is a 32-page personal handbook that was distributed through public libraries in southern California in October 1995. This handbook encourages earthquake awareness and preparedness by helping people understand the hazards we all face and what can be done about them. Many people in southern California and elsewhere do not take measures to prepare themselves for earthquakes for a variety of reasons, including fear, denial, and ignorance. We avoid thinking about the things that frighten us; we deny that rare events will affect us; and in many cases, we simply do not know what we can do to help ourselves. The new handbook  Putting Down Roots  in Earthquake Country speaks to our fear, denial, and ignorance in three parts:       The Earthquake Hazard —Confronting the Inevitable: How concerned should we be about earthquakes? The  handbook tells us what we can expect from the earthquake threat while we live in southern California.   The Earthquake Risk —Taking Control: Earthquakes are inevitable, but the damage from earthquakes is not.  We can take control of our environment to make our homes and workplaces safer. The handbook clearly illustrates  what individuals can do before, during, and immediately following an earthquake.   Earthquake ABC’s —Reviewing the Basics: Understanding reduces fear, and earthquakes and their effects  are understandable. The handbook offers clear explanations of earthquake science.        The handbook is a clearly written, profusely illustrated document carefully designed for easy reading and frequent reference. The many practical aspects of the handbook include an outline for an eight-step family earthquake plan and suggestions for training family members in earthquake safety.   The handbook was prepared and brought to southern Californians by the USGS, the National Science Foundation Southern California Earthquake Center, the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, and other concerned businesses and organizations of southern California. Two million copies of the handbook were distributed in October 1995 to schools, companies, and the public through public libraries and the SCEC Knowledge Transfer Office.     From the Handbook...   “The road to earthquake safety.”   “We would all be better prepared for earthquakes if we knew when the next one was coming. However, unlike the storm front that must travel to you before rain can begin, there are no warning signs for earthquakes. We have found no scientifically verifiable way to predict earthquakes.”   “Even though we cannot predict the time of the next earthquake, science can help us live safely with earthquakes. The road to earthquake safety follows several steps. First, we must estimate what earthquakes of what size are likely to occur (geology). Given that earthquake, we then estimate what the shaking will be (seismology). Given that shaking, we estimate the response of different types of buildings (earthquake engineering). Only with all these steps completed can we take the steps as a society to enact building codes and retrofitting programs to make our community safer.”       Updating California’s Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program   T he State of California, through its Seismic Safety Commission, began a series of 5-year plans for the California Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program in 1986. The report  California at Risk  details the plans and is updated annually to reflect new information and changing needs. The USGS contributes to the State program through membership on and liaison to the California Seismic Safety Commission, through participating regularly in updating the State report and by membership on FEMA’s post-disaster assessment teams whose recommendations are incorporated into State plans. As part of the response to the Northridge earthquake, the USGS participated on an interagency team that developed the 1994 post-earthquake update to California at Risk. This update, originally published separately as a 1994 Status Report will be fully integrated into the State Plan in late 1996. California at Risk is an excellent example of the link between scientific findings and applying those findings to earthquake-hazards reduction through updating building codes and changing and enacting legislation.

The network, which went on line in January 1999, ended a five-year gap during which there was only one operating station in Ohio. The state was dependent on seismographs in Kentucky and Michigan to record Ohio earthquakes.     It is surprising to many Ohioans that the state has experienced more than 160 felt earthquakes since 1776, and that 15 of these events have caused minor to moderate damage. The largest historic earthquake centered in Ohio was in 1937 in Shelby County. This event, estimated to have had a magnitude of about 5.4, caused considerable damage in Anna and several other western Ohio communities.  At least 40 earthquakes have been felt in the Anna area since 1875. Northeastern Ohio, east of Cleveland, including a 5.0 magnitude event in 1986 that caused moderate damage.  A broad area of southern Ohio has experienced more than 30 felt earthquakes.     The 23 stations of the Ohio Seismic Network are distributed across the state, but are concentrated in the most seismically active areas or in areas that provide optimal conditions for detecting and locating small earthquakes. These small earthquakes are important because they occur more frequently and help to identify the location of faults that may periodically produce larger, potentially damaging earthquakes.     The Ohio Seismic Network stations are located at colleges, universities, and other institutions. The seismographs employ new technology that not only makes them very accurate but also relatively inexpensive and easy to operate and maintain. In contrast to the old technology, in which a pen made a squiggly line on a paper drum, the new system is entirely digital and uses a Macintosh desktop computer to continuously record and display data. An inexpensive GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver is used to keep very precise time on the continuously recorded seismogram, and each station's computer is connected to the Internet for rapid data transfer. This system, including software to make all of the components work together and to analyze data, was developed by Dr. Larry J. Ruff at the University of Michigan.      Each seismograph station is a cooperative effort. The seismometer, the instrument that detects Earth motions, and other seismic components were purchased by the Division of Geological Survey with funds provided by the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) , through the  Ohio Emergency Management Agency , as part of the  National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program . The computers and Internet connection were purchased and provided by the cooperating institution.       The Division of Geological Survey coordinates the seismic network and operates from the Ohio Earthquake Information Center at the  Division's Laboratory  at Alum Creek State Park, north of Columbus. This facility functions as a repository and laboratory for rock core and well cuttings but has a specially constructed room for earthquake recording. The seismograph system allows for very rapid location of the epicenter and calculation of magnitude of any earthquake in the state. The earthquake records, or seismograms, from at least three seismograph stations are needed to determine earthquake locations (epicenters). These records can be downloaded from the Internet at any station on the network, and location and magnitude can be determined.      The Ohio Seismic Network provides a new dimension of understanding about the pulse of the Earth beneath Ohio. Although the seismograph network cannot predict earthquakes or provide an alert prior to an event, it provides insight into earthquake risk in the state so that intelligent decisions about building and facility design and construction, insurance coverage, and other planning decisions can be made by individuals, business and industry, and governmental agencies.

increases for this program total $876, of which $635 will be covered by     other program reductions and $241 will be absorbed.        Earthquake Hazards       Current Program Highlights       The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program provides the     scientific information and knowledge necessary to reduce deaths, injuries,     and economic losses from earthquakes.  Products of this program include     timely notifications of earthquake locations, size, and potential damage,     regional and national assessments of earthquakes hazards, and increased     understanding of the cause of earthquakes and their effects.       The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program is the applied     Earth science component of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program     (NEHRP) authorized by the "" Earthquake Hazards Reduction     Authorization Act of 2000 ,"" P.L. 106-503.  FEMA is the lead     agency of the national program and it coordinates the activities with the     three other principal NEHRP agencies:  USGS, National Science     Foundation (NSF), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).       The three basic elements of the USGS Earthquake     Hazards Program and their approximate budget share are:               Assessment and Characterization of Earthquake       Hazards, 40 percent.                         Monitoring, and reporting earthquake activity       and crustal deformation, 40 percent.                         Conducting Research into Earthquake Causes and       Effects, 20 percent.             These program areas are described in detail     below.  The USGS supports external research and monitoring activities     in each of these elements.  Approximately 25 percent of the total     Earthquake Hazards Program budget is directed toward research grants and     cooperative agreements with universities, State agencies, and private     technical firms.  The external work is carried out in all three     elements listed above.       Assessment and     Characterization of Earthquake Hazards  (estimates for FY 2000,     $8.2 million; FY 2001; $8.4 million; FY 2002, $8.6 million) -- The USGS     contributes to earthquake hazard mitigation strategies by estimating and     describing the likelihood and potential effects of moderate-to-large     earthquakes in high-risk regions of the United States, and by transferring     this knowledge to individuals, organizations, and agencies that can reduce     the impact of potentially damaging earthquakes.  Federal, State, and     local government agencies, architects and engineers, insurance companies and     other private businesses, land-use planners, emergency response officials,     and the general public rely on the USGS for earthquake hazard information to     refine building codes, develop land use strategies, safeguard lifelines and     critical facilities, develop emergency response plans, and take other     precautionary actions to reduce losses from future earthquakes.       Products for Earthquake Loss Reduction  --     USGS national seismic hazard maps are being used to develop new, unified     building codes for the United States.  The maps integrate geologic     mapping; fault locations, fault slip rates, and earthquake recurrence     intervals; and analyses of crustal deformation, ground-motion patterns, and     recent seismicity.  These maps are in digital format and give, as a     function of latitude and longitude, the maximum severity of ground shaking     (in terms of horizontal acceleration) that can be expected during exposure     periods of 50, 100, and 250 years.  As such, they are the basis for     applying the seismic design criteria contained in the building codes.      The maps and their associated databases are also being used to predict     earthquake losses and to define insurance risks.  A new seismic hazards     map for Hawaii was produced in 1999, and efforts are underway to produce     similar maps for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa and     Guam.  Periodic review and updating of the seismic hazard maps to     incorporate new information are among the highest priorities for the USGS.      The next generation of maps is scheduled for release by the end of FY 2001,     and the USGS is working closely with earthquake researchers, engineers, and     State and local government representatives across the Nation to insure that     the base geologic data represent the most current and accurate information     available.       Earthquake Hazards Assessments in Urban Areas      -- The national scale earthquake hazards maps cannot take into account     variations in the amplitude and duration of seismic shaking caused by local     geologic structures and soil conditions.  The USGS is generating     products that address the specific hazards in high-to-moderate risk urban     areas, where the population and risks are greatest, such as the San     Francisco Bay area, and Los Angeles, California; Seattle, Washington; Salt     Lake City, Utah; Memphis, Tennessee; and Charleston, South Carolina.      Earthquake shaking scenarios are being developed for public planning, and     modeling of ground motion is being provided for engineering     applications.  In conjunction with these products, the USGS conducts     workshops to assure the proper transfer of knowledge and to help design     effective mitigation.       Monitoring and     Reporting Earthquake Activity and Crustal Deformation  (estimates     for FY 2000, $19.0 million; FY 2001, $21.3 million; FY 2002, $21.5 million)     -- USGS has the assigned Federal responsibility for monitoring and     notification of seismic activity in the United States.  The USGS     fulfills this role by operating the U.S. National Seismograph Network (USNSN),     the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), and the National Strong     Motion Program (NSMP), and by supporting sixteen regional networks in areas     of moderate-to-high seismic activity.  All of these efforts are     coordinated under the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS).  The     USGS also supports geodetic monitoring systems that measure the static     deformation of the Earth's crust due to earthquakes and     earthquake-generating processes.  The geodetic monitoring is done with     high-precision, land-based surveying techniques and the satellite-based     Global Positioning System (GPS).  Data derived from these monitoring     systems are used to identify seismic hazards and, following an earthquake,     to rapidly characterize the probable size and extent of damage, assess the     continuing risks from aftershocks and related ground-motion and     ground-failure hazards, and facilitate the work of response officials.       Regional Earthquake Monitoring  -- The USGS     and cooperating universities operate regional seismic networks in areas of     high seismicity.  Data from all U.S. seismic networks are used to     monitor active tectonic structures in much greater detail than is possible     with the national scale network.  Each region has a local data center     where the data are processed and regional catalogues of earthquakes are     produced.  These data centers serve as local distribution points for     information about earthquakes to the public, local and State agencies, and     other regional interests.  The regional data centers relay earthquake     data in real time to the National Earthquake Information Center as well as     to other regional networks.  Data centers also provide information     about regional earthquake hazards and accepted mitigation practices, and     those data centers located at universities provide training and research     facilities for students.       Monitoring Strong Motions Due to Earthquakes      -- Conventional seismometers used in earthquake monitoring networks cannot     accurately record strong ground and building motions caused by large, nearby     earthquakes, yet this technical data is extremely valuable for the design of     earthquake resistant buildings and other structures.  Through the     National Strong Motion Program, the USGS maintains about 840 strong motion     recorders in 35 States and territories.  The strong motion data show     the amplitude, frequency content, and duration of strong accelerations     caused by an earthquake.  These parameters are direct inputs to     computer models and scale models of structures to test their performance     under realistic earthquake shaking.       The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS)      -- In 2000, Congress authorized the upgrade of the seismic monitoring     networks in the United States through the implementation of an Advanced     National Seismic System (ANSS).  In the same legislation, Congress     requested an ANSS management plan that was delivered in May 2001.  The     ANSS is being used to improve management of the national and regional     seismic monitoring networks whenever funds are available to unify,     modernize, and expand earthquake monitoring equipment and activities in the     United States.  Implementation of an ANSS would involve five basic     components:  (1) An expanded U.S. National Seismographic Network; (2)     expanded and modernized regional networks; (3) creation of dense networks of     urban stations capable of monitoring strong motion both on the ground and in     structures; (4) two portable, temporary seismograph arrays that can be     rapidly deployed following an earthquake; and (5) upgrade and integration of     regional and national recording centers with the capability of disseminating     data and information in real time.  An important emphasis of ANSS is     improved monitoring in metropolitan areas in regions of high-to-moderate     seismic risk.  In total, ANSS envisions the addition of 6,000 new     seismic monitoring instruments in over 25 urban centers:  3,000 of     these would be deployed in reference sites (i.e., ground based) and an     additional 3,000 in structures.  Implementation of ANSS would also     result in improved integration of existing networks and the addition of     1,000 broadband stations in regional networks across the Nation.      Through the real-time hazards initiative, ANSS implementation efforts in FY     2000 focused on the installation of new recording sites in three     metropolitan areas:  Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle.      Instrumentation continued in these three urban centers in FY 2001, along     with new efforts in Anchorage, Memphis, and Reno.

Monitoring Changes in Shape of the Earth's     Surface  -- Geodetic networks provide essential information about     movement of the land surface near faults and earthquake source zones.      The USGS is working with universities and local agencies to conduct geodetic     investigations using GPS and laser-ranging surveys.  A dense network of     continuous GPS stations is being installed in Southern California, in     cooperation with NASA, NSF, and Scripps University, to determine the     distribution of long-term crustal deformation and the spatial and temporal     variations of the strain field.  During the next year, with funding     support from USGS cooperators, new stations will be sited and installed,     communications and data retrieval operations will be developed, and     processing and archiving centers will be established.  The USGS has a     lead role in operation of the network, with responsibility to maintain     stations and download and interpret the data.  In addition, the USGS is     investigating a new satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture     Radar (InSAR), that has the potential of quickly and accurately providing     large aerial maps of pre- and post-earthquake land deformation.  Work     is underway to develop computational tools necessary to efficiently analyze,     interpret, and model InSAR data.  The InSAR results in Southern     California will be used to augment, check, and if necessary, correct the     independent GPS measurements.       Conducting     Research into Earthquake Causes and Effects  (estimates for FY     2000, $7.6 million; FY 2001, $7.8 million; FY 2002, $7.9 million) -- The     USGS conducts research on the causes, characteristics, and effects of     earthquakes.  This research has direct application in earthquake     hazards assessments, earthquake forecasts, and earthquake mitigation     practices.       Studies of Earthquake Processes  -- A major     focus of USGS earthquake research is in understanding earthquake occurrence     in space and time.  Ongoing USGS investigations seek to understand the     physical conditions for earthquake initiation and growth; processes of     earthquake triggering; how individual faults in the same region interact;     why some faults slip slowly without generating earthquakes while others     generate earthquakes; and the factors that control variations in recurrence     intervals of earthquakes along the same fault.       Studies of Earthquake Effects  -- USGS     research efforts are also directed at improving the understanding of     earthquake-induced, strong ground shaking and its effects.      Specifically, USGS researchers are investigating how complexities in the     earthquake source, Earth's crust, and near-surface soils and deposits     influence seismic wave propagation and strong ground motion.  Improving     current techniques for forecasting the effects of strong ground motion will     greatly improve seismic hazard maps for urban regions; these efforts are     thus critical for cost-effective earthquake hazard mitigation.  Another     research priority is the identification and understanding of the behavior of     weak soils that liquefy and fail when subjected to earthquake shaking.      Research on ground failure, carried out in collaboration with structural and     geotechnical engineers, will lead to improved design of earthquake-resistant     infrastructure and lifelines, such as bridges and airports, commonly built     on fill or weak soil.       Short-Term Warnings  -- USGS earthquake     research also continues to address the problem of short-term warnings in the     days or hours before damaging earthquakes.  Well-documented geologic     and (or) hydrologic signals preceded the Loma Prieta and Kobe earthquakes,     warranting thorough investigation of these phenomena.  The ongoing USGS     earthquake prediction experiment at Parkfield, California, may permit not     only the recording of pre-earthquake signals, but also the possibility of     understanding their origin.  Additionally, the USGS will continue     research in the forecasting of earthquake aftershocks, which is of great     value to citizens and public safety officials in the aftermath of large     earthquakes.       Post-Earthquake Investigations  -- The USGS     responds to large domestic earthquakes and to some foreign earthquakes by     deploying portable seismic and geodetic instrumentation, conducting detailed     geologic field investigations, and evaluating damage patterns in relation to     geologic conditions and effects.  These investigations provide     essential information during and immediately after the emergency and an     opportunity to make substantial advances in our understanding of earthquake     geology and in the development of earthquake resistant design, construction,     and engineering practices.       External Cooperative Agreements and Grants  --     The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program supports a competitive, peer-reviewed,     external program of cooperative agreements and grants that enlists the     talents and expertise of State and local government, the academic community,     and the private sector.  The investigations and activities supported     though the external programs are closely coordinated with and complement the     internal USGS program efforts.  In general, routine monitoring efforts     are supported through 3-year cooperative agreements; research efforts are     supported through 1- or 2-year grants.  In FY 2001, 18 cooperative     agreements were funded to support regional seismic monitoring and long-term     research efforts in various parts of the country.  A total of 115     research grants were supported, 83 with universities and colleges, 9 with     State geological surveys, and 23 with private sector companies (see chart     below).  Many of the external projects are co-funded with other     agencies and sources, leveraging the effect of USGS support.  External     program activities include:  Monitoring and locating earthquakes by     regional seismographic networks, mapping seismic hazards in metropolitan     areas, developing credible earthquake planning scenarios including loss     estimates, defining the prehistoric record of large earthquakes,     investigating the origins of earthquakes, and improving methods for     predicting earthquake effects.  By involving the external community,     the USGS program increases its geographical and institutional impact,     promotes earthquake awareness across the Nation, encourages the application     of new hazards assessment techniques by State and local governments and the     private sector, and increases the level of technical knowledge within State     and local government agencies.  To support external work, $6.0 million     has been provided annually for competitively awarded earthquake research     grants; $3.0 million is provided through cooperative agreements for the     operation and maintenance of regional seismographic networks, and $1.1     million is provided to the Southern California Earthquake Center at the     University of Southern California in a cooperative agreement with the     university and the National Science Foundation.  The FY 2002 request     maintains this same level of funding.

The USGS national seismic hazard maps and     associated databases were recently used by FEMA to produce a landmark     national assessment of expected annualized losses from earthquakes (FEMA     report #366, released Sept. 2000).  Future distribution of Federal     funds for earthquake mitigation may, in the future, be tied to this     assessment.  In addition, USGS seismic hazard information is used by     numerous consulting companies to estimate earthquake losses for insurance     companies, pension funds, and other clients.  The USGS national hazard     maps are also used for regulatory purposes by the EPA for seismic design of     landfills.  In all of these cases, USGS national seismic hazard maps     allow users to assess the hazard and loss from future earthquakes, enabling     them to proactively mitigate the effects of these earthquakes and, hence,     save lives and property.       Seismic Hazard and Lifeline Maps in the Puget     Sound Region  -- A derivative product from regional hazard assessment     efforts in the Pacific Northwest has been the production of hazard maps with     critical transportation and utility lifelines superimposed.  These     lifeline maps were first generated for Kitsap County, WA, and were so well     received that counties up and down the I-5 corridor have requested that the     maps be extended to include their region.  Efforts are now underway to     extend the maps from the United States/Canada border, south to Eugene, OR;     Canadian counterparts will further extend the maps into British     Columbia.  Local counties in Washington and Oregon are providing     financial and technical assistance to complete this effort.  The maps     have been the primary means by which government officials have promoted     seismic retrofitting in the region.  Citizens recently approved     approximately $250 million for seismic retrofitting including the largest     voter-approved bond effort ever ($195 million).       USGS Hazard Information Used in Seismic Design     and Updating of Building Codes  -- A component of the seismic hazard     assessment effort is the preparation of design maps for use in model     building codes.  The USGS seismic hazard maps are incorporated into the      NEHRP Recommended Provisions , which serve as the resource documents     for the 2000 International Building Code (IBC) and the International     Residential Code (IRC).  The IBC and IRC are replacing regional-based     codes, which are expected to be implemented throughout the Nation, with     periodic updates every 3 years.       As part of the design map effort, USGS researchers     released a design CD-ROM that allows designers to easily locate pertinent     seismic map design parameters.  This represents significant timesavings     for designers who for the first time have a single source for all design     information.  The model code groups elected to include the CD with all     copies of the Code document that are sold.  There have been about     40,000 codes sold to date.       ANSS and Real-Time Hazards Seismic Monitoring     Upgrades  -- During FY 2000, the first 81 stations of the Advanced     National Seismic System (ANSS) were installed as part of the real-time     hazards initiative.  Forty of the 80 new ANSS strong motion stations in     FY 2000 were deployed in the San Francisco Bay area, while the remaining 40     were split equally between the Seattle and Salt Lake City regions.      Most of the new stations in the San Francisco Bay area were in place and     recording at the time of the September 5, 2000, magnitude 5.2 Yountville,     California, earthquake.  These instruments provided critical     information about why this quake caused so much damage in the vicinity of     Napa (see following re: ShakeMap).  In FY 2001, ANSS efforts will be     expanded to include three additional urban areas: Anchorage, Memphis, and     Reno; full implementation of ANSS would encompass over 25 urban areas across     the country.       Implementation of ""ShakeMap"" in     Northern California and the Yountville Earthquake  -- ShakeMap is a new     technique to estimate earthquake damage patterns and impact based on     instrumental recordings of seismic shaking in urban areas.  ShakeMap     was initially developed in Southern California where the real-time seismic     monitoring network (TriNet) allows for rapid computation of these     maps.  The ultimate goal is to provide a picture of an earthquake's     impact within minutes of the event so that emergency managers can speed     earthquake disaster relief, thereby saving lives.  Recent network     enhancements in northern California as part of ANSS have enabled preliminary     implementation of ShakeMap in this region as well.       On September 5, 2000, in response to the magnitude     5.2 Yountville earthquake, a ShakeMap was produced in northern California     just after the event and was updated as more data became available.      The ShakeMap confirmed human reports that the ground shaking resulting from     the Yountville earthquake was felt more strongly in the vicinity of Napa     (~10 miles away) than at the epicenter of the quake. (See:  http://quake.usgs.gov/recent/reports/napa/index.html ).      This may seem surprising, as seismic energy is typically strongest at the     earthquake's epicenter, dissipating outward.  However, two other     factors also influenced ground shaking in this event: the amplification of     shaking by young sediments along the Napa River; and the focusing of strong     motion to the southeast, the direction the earthquake rupture     propagated.  These contributing factors are evident on the ShakeMap,     which was designed with precisely this situation in mind - when damage is     not symmetric about an earthquake's origin.  ShakeMap can thus be a     powerful tool in the minutes and hours that follow an event in identifying     the likely distribution of damage.  Once ANSS network upgrades in the     San Francisco Bay area are complete, the technology will be in place to     generate ShakeMaps within the first several minutes following the onset of     shaking, thereby further facilitating emergency response efforts.       Earthquake Probabilities Calculated for     Istanbul, Turkey  -- The large Izmit and Düzce earthquakes that occurred     in Turkey in 1999 represent the latest in a series of westward-propagating,     large earthquakes on the North Anatolian fault since 1939.  If the     sequence of earthquakes continues to progress westward, then Istanbul, the     largest urban center in Turkey with a population of 10 million people, could     experience severe shaking because the city lies just north of the western     branching of the fault into the Marmara Sea.  The North Anatolian fault     is an excellent analog to the San Andreas fault, and as such, offers     important insights into strike-slip faulting processes that may be relevant     to California as well as Turkey.  For this reason, USGS scientists have     long been interested in the behavior of the North Anatolian fault, and most     recently have attempted to model its behavior.  Working with Turkish     counterparts, the USGS, in FY 2000, released a report estimating the     probability of a large earthquake striking near Istanbul.  The estimate     was based on a calibrated catalog of the historic earthquakes in the region     during the last 500 years and took into account the effect of stress     transfer from the most recent events.  USGS scientists computed a 62 ±     15 percent chance over the next 30 years and a 32 ± 12 percent chance     during the next 10 years of strong shaking from a large earthquake near     Istanbul.  The USGS, in cooperation with the U.S. Office of Foreign     Disaster Assistance, is now involved in follow-up efforts with Turkish     scientists to enhance these models and to develop prototype microzonation     maps that can be used to locally assess seismic risk and guide seismic     retrofitting efforts.  The USGS will also consult with scientists at     the Kandilli Observatory in Ankara on efforts to upgrade seismic monitoring     networks in Turkey.       Studies of Prehistoric Earthquake Clustering in     the Seattle Region  -- The USGS conducts paleoseismology studies at a     number of sites across the United States to determine past earthquake     chronologies.  New studies in the Seattle region, along a newly     discovered strand of the Seattle fault, document at least three     surface-rupturing earthquake between 3,000 and 1,000 years ago.  In     contrast, these same studies show that no earthquake faulting or folding is     believed to have occurred during the preceding 7,000-13,000 years.  The     data suggest that an episode of earthquake clustering occurred (irregular     recurrence) at this site, approximately 12-kilometers west of downtown     Seattle.  Earthquake clustering on the Seattle fault implies that     similar clusters may characterize other, unstudied faults in the Puget     lowland.       Nisqually Earthquake  -- A magnitude 6.8     earthquake occurred 10 miles northeast of Olympia, Washington, on February     28, 2001.  The earthquake was widely felt in the Puget Sound area and     caused over $2 billion of damage in Olympia, Tacoma, and Seattle.      Fortunately, only one death and about 200 injuries were reported.  An     earthquake of similar magnitude, 6.7, occurred near Los Angeles in 1994,     killing over 60 and causing $40 billion in losses.       There are two dominant reasons for the contrast in     impact of these two earthquakes of similar magnitude:               The first is the difference in depth of the       earthquakes.  The earthquake near Seattle occurred 30 miles deep       within the Earth; the Los Angeles earthquake was less than 10 miles       deep.  The strong seismic shaking from the deeper Seattle earthquake       was attenuated as it traveled the extra 20 miles to reach the surface.                         The second reason is earthquake       preparedness.  The USGS Earthquake Program has been working in the       Seattle area for the past 15 years to assess earthquake hazards and to       relay these assessments to local officials in ways that could be       understood and acted upon.  The USGS has personnel stationed in       Seattle who work closely with geologists and seismologists at the       University of Washington.  This combined effort, through a series of       publications, briefings, and public workshops, raised the awareness of the       earthquake hazard in the region and led to the implementation of       mitigation measures.  For example, the USGS helped form the Cascadia       Region Earthquake Working Group (CREW), a consortium of private interests       such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Bank of America, which has been taking       measures to reduce the regional economic risks due to earthquakes in the       area.             The USGS recognized the importance of measuring     the severity and variation of strong ground shaking in the urban area during     an earthquake.  This data is essential for effective earthquake     resistant design, construction, and retrofitting of buildings.  In FY     2000, under a Real-Time Hazard initiative, which began the implementation of     the ANSS, 20 modern seismometers, capable of recording earthquakes of     magnitude 8, were installed in the Seattle region.  All 20 of these new     instruments worked during the earthquake and provided immediate information     on the severity and regional distribution of strong ground shaking.       Digital Fault Database for the United States      -- During FY 2001, the USGS completed compilation of a database containing     information on all known geologic faults in the United States active within     the last 2 million years (Quaternary).  This enormous task has     involved:  (1) Literature searches for information, with field checking     in some cases, on all Quaternary faults; (2) synthesizing data and compiling     concise descriptions in a common format; and (3) digitizing the faults     traces for inclusion in a Geographic Information System (GIS) with links to     the fault characteristics in the accompanying database.  The     compilation includes data for fault slip rates and the size and dates of     associated earthquake.  This database is structured so that new or     revised information can be entered easily in a standard format.  This     type of information is crucial for the revision of future national and     regional earthquake hazard maps and for developing earthquake scenarios for     emergency preparedness.                                                                                                                                                                                               Return to Office of Budget    For more information, contact:  cburzyk@usgs.gov           Privacy Statement     Disclaimer     FOIA     Accessibility                  U.S. Department of the Interior ,   U.S. Geological Survey  URL http://www.usgs.gov/budget/2002_Justification/02earthquake.html   Contact Us   Last modification: 19-Aug-2002@07:33"

We use the mapped surface slip and fault geometry to infer the transfer of stress throughout the sequence. Calculations of the change in Coulomb failure stress reveal that 9 out of 10 ruptures were brought closer to failure by the preceding shocks, typically by 1-10 bars, equivalent to 3-30 years of secular stressing. We translate the calculated stress changes into earthquake probability gains using an earthquake-nucleation constitutive relation, which includes both permanent and transient effects of the sudden stress changes. The transient effects of the stress changes dominate during the mean 10-year period between triggering and subsequent rupturing shocks in the Anatolia sequence. The stress changes result in an average three-fold gain in the net earthquake probability during the decade after each event. Stress is calculated to be high today at several isolated sites along the fault. During the next 30 years, we estimate a 15% probability of a  M >=6.7 earthquake east of the major eastern center of Ercinzan, and a 12% probability for a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit. Such stress-based probability calculations may thus be useful to assess and update earthquake hazards elsewhere.        Key words: stress triggering, stress transfer, earthquake sequence, earthquake nucleation, hazard assessment, Izmit, Erzincan, Istanbul       INTRODUCTION        Like falling dominoes, four westward-migrating earthquakes ruptured 725 km    of the North Anatolian fault during 1939-44, with subsequent earthquakes extending    the zone of faulting eastward and westward ( Fig.    1 ). This classic case of progressive earthquake failure has tantalized earth    scientists (Allen, 1969; Dewey, 1976; Jackson & McKenzie, 1988; Richter,    1958; Scholz, 1990) , and terrorized insurance providers, for half a century.    Although clustering of earthquakes in space and time is common (Dieterich, 1994;    Kagan & Jackson, 1991) , and migrating earthquake sequences have occurred    elsewhere (Kasahara, 1981; Mogi, 1985) , none is as spectacular as on the North    Anatolian fault. Most recently, Roth (1988) modeled the shear stress buildup    along the western part of the North Anatolian fault using a simple fault geometry    with collinear ruptures of uniform slip, and found that the stress at future    ruptures was generally raised by the preceding events.      New observations of the North Anatolian fault, as well as new methods to calculate    how seismic stress transfer alters the probability of subsequent earthquakes,    encourage us to revisit this sequence to learn what conditions promote progressive    failure. Until recently, the fault geometry was poorly known, and there were    few measurements of the 1939-44 earthquake fault slip (Ambraseys, 1970; Ketin,    1969) , precluding calculation of the earthquake-induced stresses. Nor could    the stress transferred by the steady or 'secular' stress accumulation be calculated,    since the rate of deep fault slip driving the stress buildup was uncertain by    a factor of four (Barka, 1992; Jackson & McKenzie, 1988; Le Pichon,  et    al. , 1993) . New findings remove these obstacles: A threefold increase in    measurements of earthquake slip, including a twelve-fold increase for the largest    1939 shock (Barka, 1995) provides data essential to model the earthquake stress    changes ( Fig. 1 b ).    New detailed fault mapping (Barka, 1992; Saroglu & Kusçu, 1992) (Fig.    1 c ) reduces the uncertainty in the fault location from about ±25    km to ±5 km. Finally, geodetic analyses yield the slip rate along the fault    (Oral, 1994; Straub & Kahle, 1994; Straub, 1996) .      The North Anatolian fault emerges as a close analogue of the San Andreas fault    in California, with the two continental transforms sharing similar slip rates,    total length, and straightness relative to their poles of rotation ( Fig.    1 a ). But while the San Andreas fault produced just two  M >=6.7    earthquakes in this century (in 1906 and 1989), the North Anatolian fault has    suffered ten such shocks, thus providing a superior natural laboratory to study    earthquake interaction ( Fig.    1 b-c ). Ruptures from Parkfield to the Salton Sea within 5 yr would,    for example, be a comparable sequence on the San Andreas fault. We find that    all but one earthquake increased the stress toward failure at the site of the    subsequent shocks, and inhibited failure on most fault segments which did not    rupture. We argue that the calculated several-bar stress increases raised the    earthquake probability three-fold during the ensuing decade, and we suggest    why migrating earthquake sequences are prevalent on the North Anatolian fault.    Bolstered by recent findings that aftershocks and background seismicity concentrate    where the stress has risen (Harris & Simpson, 1992; Harris,  et al. ,    1995; Jaumé & Sykes, 1992; King,  et al. , 1994; Stein,  et    al. , 1994; Jaumé & Sykes, 1996) , these results offer a new approach    to updatable forecasts of earthquake hazard.             COULOMB FAILURE STRESS CHANGE         We calculate the static Coulomb stress changes resulting from North Anatolian    ruptures since 1939, with stress calculated in an elastic halfspace at all points    (as shown in Figs.  3 b ,     4  and  5 )    or resolved on the fault plane (as listed in the tables and shown in  Fig.    3 a ). Since we lack hypocentral depths for the Anatolian main shocks,    we sample stress in the central part of the seismogenic crust at a depth of    8 km. Failure is facilitated on a plane when the Coulomb failure stress s f     rises                        ,         (1)      where is the shear stress on the failure plane b (positive in the direction    of fault slip) and sb' is the effective normal stress (positive in compression);    ms'b ª m'sb, where m' is the apparent coefficient of friction with range    0.0-0.75. The confining stress can be related to fluid pore pressure by Skempton's    coefficient,  B , the ratio of the change in pore pressure in a cavity    to the change in applied stress, where m' = m(1- B ) (Roeloffs, 1988) .    Immediately after the earthquake,  B  ª 2/3, but could fall to zero    if fluids were to drain fully from the fault zone (Scholz, 1990) . We set m'=0.4;    equivalent to laboratory values of friction (m~0.75) and moderate pore pressure    if fluids are not fully expelled ( B ~0.5), or to a low value of friction    as inferred for the San Andreas fault (Zoback  et al. , 1987) . A m' of    0.4 also minimizes the calculation error caused by the uncertainty in m' to    ±25% (King, et al., 1994) ; compare, for example,  col. 2  (for m'    = 0.75) and  col. 3  (for m' = 0.40) in Table 2.          Secular stress change        In addition to earthquakes, steady slip beneath the North Anatolia fault system    transfers stress to the seismogenic portion of the fault. This we model with    slip tapering from 0 at 12.5-km depth to the full rate below 24 km ( Fig.    2 a ). GPS data give 24±4 mm/yr along the North Anatolian fault    (Oral, 1994) ; near its western end, slip is partitioned with 16 mm/yr along    the Karamürsel-Sapanca faults and 9 mm/yr along the Iznik-Geyve faults (Straub    & Kahle, 1994; Straub, 1996) . GPS data also resolve left-lateral slip of    18±6 mm/yr on the East Anatolian fault and ~5 mm/yr on the Northeast Anatolian    fault (Bennett,  et al. , 1996; Oral, 1994) (Fig. 1 c  and  Fig.    2 ). During a complete earthquake cycle in this model, coseismic slip would    take place over 0-12.5 km and secular slip over 12.5-100 km. Such a model will    not produce uniform stress even when averaged over many earthquake cycles, since    the fault strike and coseismic slip are both variable ( Fig.    1 b ). In addition, we neglect postseismic slip beneath 12.5 km, so    we likely underestimate the total stress transfer during the cycle.      Shear stress builds in this model at 0.15 bar/yr along most of the North    Anatolian fault ( Fig.    2 b ). Because uniform right-lateral slip is imposed beneath a relatively    straight North Anatolian fault at depth, appreciable normal stress is transferred    to the fault at seismogenic depths only at fault bends (such as at km = -350    to -400, or km 500-550). A uniform stress increase of 0.01 bar/yr is added at    all points to account for the small residual stressing on faults more than 100    km from Anatolia fault system. ( Fig.    1 a ). This small addition stress keeps the secular stress buildup    positive at all sites in the model.          Resolved and optimally-oriented stress changes          The Coulomb stress change caused by the 1939 earthquake is resolved on major    faults in  Fig. 3 a .    Shear and normal stress is resolved on the fault surface, (projected in UTM    coordinates) at a depth of 8 km. Faults are assumed to be vertical and to slip    in the sense indicated by the arrows, except for the west end of the 1939 rupture,    which dips 50°N and has oblique reverse slip. The apparent coefficient    of friction, m', is assumed to be 0.4; no information about the regional stress    is needed for this calculation. The Coulomb stress is seen to drop by 50-100    bars along most of the 1939 rupture, with increases of several bars along the    west end, beyond the east end, and along most of the succeeding 1942 fault rupture    zone. The resolved stress changes are sensitive both to position and fault strike.    Note that a right-lateral Coulomb stress of 100 bars is not equivalent to a    left-lateral Coulomb stress of -100 bars on the same fault unless m'=0, because    unlike the shear stress change, the sign of the normal stress change is the    same for right- or left-lateral slip (e.g., fault-normal tension always favors    failure). Thus the resolved stresses depends on inferring the sense of slip    on each fault correctly. This result for the 1939 rupture, and for all succeeding    events, is summarized in Tables 1-4.     The Coulomb stress change on optimally oriented vertical strike-slip faults    (King, et al., 1994) is plotted in  Fig.    3 b  at a depth of 8 km. To create such a map, one must impose an orientation,    and to a lesser extent, magnitude, of the regional (or tectonic) stress, sr.    Here we assume a 100-bar uniaxial compression oriented 55° clockwise from    the fault as shown by the white opposed arrows in Figs.  2 b     and  4 a . About    a dozen sites along the North Anatolian fault exhibit geologic indicators of    the orientation of the principal compression axis (Andrieux,  et al. ,    1995; Neugebauer, 1995; Suzanne,  et al. , 1990); they average 58°    relative to the local strike of the North Anatolian fault. The principal strain-rate    axes (Oral, 1994) measured geodetically from the Marmara Sea to the central    1939 rupture zone indicate an axis oriented 48° clockwise from the fault.    We use a weighted average of these observations. Dynamic models (Gülen,     et al. , 1987; Kasapoglu & Toksöz, 1983), which consider the    stresses imparted to the North Anatolian fault by remote plate tractions, yield    a similar orientation.     The principal stresses are calculated from the tensor addition of the 100-bar    regional stress, the earthquake stress change, and the secular stress, at every    calculation point. Optimal planes are then calculated relative to the local    principal stress axes. The internal angle between the right and left plane is    a function of the apparent friction coefficient; the planes are orthogonal for    m' = 0. Once the optimal planes are obtained, the earthquake plus secular stress    changes are resolved on them. We thus calculate the change in Coulomb stress    on planes that are optimally oriented after the earthquake. At any given point,    the Coulomb stress change along the optimum right- and left-lateral planes is    the same (the black and gray planes, respectively, in Figs.  2 b     and  3 b ).     The earthquake stress change causes the optimum planes to rotate from the    orientation imposed by the regional stress. In the limiting case that the regional    stress is zero, all stress changes are positive and large rotations occur far    from the source, regardless of whether such slip directions are possible in    that environment. For an infinitely large regional stress, no rotations of the    optimal planes occur, and the areas of the positive and negative fields exactly    balance. For realistic assumptions about the regional stress ( e.g. , that    the regional stress is 1-10 times the earthquake stress drop), large rotations    are restricted close to the fault rupture, where the earthquake stress change    is significant relative to the regional stress. Positive optimally-oriented    stress changes are seen along the fault in  Fig.    3 b  where the fault slip exceeded 6 m (as seen in  Fig.    1 b ), but such positive changes apply to planes which strike at high    angle to the North Anatolia fault. Far from the 1939 rupture, rotation of the    optimal planes is negligible. For an apparent coefficient of friction m' of    0.4 in this stress field, it is seen that right-lateral faults striking east-west,    such as the North Anatolian, are optimally oriented (Figs.  2 b     and  3 b ). Coulomb    stress changes on optimally oriented planes are also plotted for a decade of    secular stress buildup in  Fig.    2 b . Here the rotations are negligible because the stress per decade,    about 1.5 bars, is small relative to the 100-bar regional stress. A complete    description of this method, and its dependence on friction and the regional    stress, is given in King,  et al.  (1994) .      To sum, we use the optimally-oriented Coulomb stress changes to visualize    stress transfer, because the patterns are simpler, and because they do not depend    on knowledge of the faults surrounding the source. Such figures also show the    correspondence between regions of calculated stress change and background seismicity    or aftershocks (Figs.  4 g     and  5 ), because small    shocks can occur on small faults, which could take any orientation consistent    with the regional stress. But for calculations of triggering, time advance,    and earthquake probability, we use the resolved stress changes as shown in  Fig.    3 a  and as listed in the tables.       STRESS EVOLUTION DURING THE SEQUENCE        The buildup of stress at successive rupture sites, as well as the competition    between secular stress accumulation and earthquake stress drop, are illustrated    by sequential plots of the Coulomb stress change ( Fig.    4 ). The stress increase along the North Anatolian fault, most evident outside    the rupture zones (yellow), is a product of the secular fault slip at depth.    Earthquakes generally relieve stress along the ruptures (purple zones), and    typically transfer stress at some sites beyond the rupture tips and off the    fault (red). Large earthquakes in 1939, 1943, and 1944 (Fig. 4 a-d )    profoundly decreased the stress over a distance of ~50 km normal to the fault;    with time, this zone of diminished stress narrows. Compare, for example, the    purple zone of the 1943 shock in  Fig.    4 c  with the same region an half-century later in  Fig.    4 g . Moderate earthquakes in 1957 and 1967 ( Fig.    4 e-f ) extended the earthquake sequence 100 km westward, but these    shocks redistributed rather than diminished the stress within 50 km of the fault,    and thus the western North Anatolian fault could re-rupture long before its    central segments. The calculated stress reduction near the 1942 shock is likewise    modest, suggesting that this section could also re-rupture. Though imperfect,    the correlation between sites of calculated stress increase and seismicity ( Fig.    4 g ) suggests that stress remains high at several sites along the    North Anatolian fault, such as the Yedisu segment (km 450-500 in  Fig.    4 g ).      The occurrence of a large earthquake off the North Anatolian fault in 1971    lends additional evidence for the stress-triggering hypothesis ( Fig.    5 ). Of the four zones brought closer to failure after the 1949 shock, two    sustained  M >=6.7 earthquakes (beyond the end of the 1949 rupture in 1966,    and in an off-fault lobe in 1971). A third site sustained an  M =5.6 shock    (in 1967) beyond the 1949 rupture at the east end of the Yedisu segment ( Fig.    5 b ). The left-lateral East Anatolian fault ruptured 50 km south of    where it joins the North Anatolian fault (Seymen & Aydin, 1972) . The preceding    North Anatolian earthquakes increased stress on the East Anatolian fault by    0.6 bars, with the stress maxima centered on the future 1971 rupture zone.    Note that stress resolved on the East Anatolian fault reaches its maxima near    the future 1971 epicenter, and remains above 0.5 bars for most of the 1971 rupture    zone ( Fig. 5 a ).    In addition, most fault segments that have not ruptured were brought farther    from failure by the 1939-49 shocks ( Fig.    5 a ). Finally, most small earthquakes occurred where the stress on    optimally-oriented faults is calculated to have risen ( Fig.    5 b ).        STRESS AT FUTURE RUPTURE SITES        Nine out of 10 shocks occurred where the mean stress over the entire    future rupture had increased, typically by 2-4 bars (Table 2,  col. 4 ).    Similarly, 9 of 10 epicenters struck where the stress had been increased by    the preceding earthquakes, typically by 3 bars (Table 2,  col. 3 ). This    calculation is independent of the regional or tectonic stress, and depends only    on the fault slip, geometry, and the friction, m'. The stress transfer averages    about 20% of the stress released by the earthquakes (Table 1,  col. 7 ),    a substantial trigger.      Although it is unknown whether the stress change along the future rupture,    or at the future epicenter, is most important to triggering, the results for    both assumptions are quite similar (Table 2). Faults are inherently complex,    en echelon, and multi-stranded on many scales. Thus it is also unknown whether    the stress change resolved on the fault plane as defined by its surface trace    (as listed in the tables), or the stress change on optimally-oriented planes    (as shown in  Fig. 4 )    is most important to earthquake triggering. The optimally-oriented stress increases    are about 25% larger than the resolved stress changes. Thus despite uncertainty    in identifying the stress component that is most effective in triggering or    advancing future earthquakes, the results lead to a consistent finding that    the transfer of stress by one earthquake to another promoted the Anatolia sequence.     Scholz (1990) argued that the 1943 epicenter lies at the 'wrong' end of the    1943 rupture, because the epicenter locates at the end of the rupture farthest    from the preceding 1942 shock. However, the calculated stress change at the    end of the 1943 rupture closest to the 1942 shock inhibited failure ( Fig.    3 ), and the 1943 epicenter lies within 40 km of where the stress change    is most positive (Fig. 3 a-b ). Only the 1949 earthquake struck farther    from the stress maxima associated with the preceding shocks (Fig. 2 d ),    which is surprising because the intervening Yedisu segment last ruptured in    1784, and so the accumulated stress should have been high. Seismicity is now    concentrated along this segment (Fig. 3 g ). The much better located    aftershocks of the 1992 earthquake lie in regions of calculated failure stress    increase (Nablant,  et al. , 1996) .      Most fault segments that sustained stress decreases have not ruptured, a further indication that stress changes influence earthquake occurrence. The typical stress change for the dozen unruptured segments since 1939 is -0.1 to -0.6 bars (Table 3,  col. 2 ), in comparison with a 2- to 4-bar increase for those that have ruptured (Table 2,  col. 3 ). Even when the secular stress accumulation during 1939-95 is included, the stress changes on the unruptured segments facilitated failure by only 1.2-1.6 bars (Table 3,  col. 4 ), in comparison with a 3.6- to 6.1-bar increase for the segments that ruptured (Table 2,  col. 5 ).         EARTHQUAKE PROBABILITIES        The effect of the stress change on times of earthquake recurrence can be cast    as a change in the probability of future events. The times of future earthquakes    along a fault segment are uncertain because of intrinsic variability of the    earthquake faulting process and uncertainty of the observations used to estimate    recurrence time. Estimations of the probability of future events over a given    time interval provide the means to account for these uncertainties. Departing    from previous studies, which consider only a permanent effect of stresses on    segment probabilities (Cornell, et al., 1993; Working Group on California Earthquake    Probabilities, 1990; Working Group on the Probabilities of Future Large Earthquakes    in Southern California, 1992), we consider both permanent and transient effects    of the stress changes on earthquake probabilities.           Segment Probability Prior to a Stress Step          Two models for estimation of earthquake probabilities are in general use,    the stationary Poisson model and the conditional probability model (Cornell,    1968; Hagiwara, 1974). The conditional probability model can be tailored to    find the effects elapsed time and stress changes on earthquake probabilities.    We first present results from the simple Poisson model for comparative purposes    and for later use in addressing transient effects of stress changes on probabilities.    The stationary Poisson model, assumes the probability of an earthquake in a    time interval is independent of the elapsed time from previous events. The probability    of at least one event in the interval  Dt  is                          ,         (2)       where  r  is a constant occurrence rate for earthquakes that rupture    the segment of interest and  N  is the expected number of such events in    the interval  Dt .      With the conditional probability model, probability can increase with time    to represent increasing stress on a fault segment toward an uncertain stress    threshold. We estimate the probability for recurrence of an earthquake on a    fault segment prior to the stress step, given an elapsed time  t   from    the previous earthquake, following the method of the Working Group on California    Earthquake Probabilities (1990). The probability for recurrence of slip in any    time interval ( t ,  t + Dt ) is                          ,         (3)      where  f ( t ) is the probability density function for the uncertain recurrence time  T  for a segment rupturing earthquake. The probability, conditional on the earthquake not occurring prior to  t ,  is                          ,         (4)       We assume a lognormal probability distribution of recurrence times                           ,         (5)       where  m  is the median and  s  is the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of the random recurrence time.      To estimate probabilities, we require values for  m  and  s , as    well as the time elapsed  t  during the 1939-67 sequence. Because the observations    are sparse and uncertain, we do not distinguish different repeat times along    the North Anatolian fault; instead we use the portions of the fault for which    the record is longest to estimate a generic repeat time ( Fig.    7 ). Although segment probabilities are sensitive to  m ,  s  and     t , we show that probability gains associated with the stress steps (the    ratios of probability after the steps to the probability before the steps) are    insensitive to parameter choices. In the west (at about km = -200 in Fig. 7),    earthquakes struck in A.D. 1035 , 1668, and 1944. For the central region, at    km = -50, events occurred in A.D. 1050 , 1668, and 1943. For the eastern region    near Erzincan at km = 350, earthquake took place in 1043 A.D., 1254, and 1939    (Ambraseys, 1970; Ikeda, et al., 1991; Ambraseys & Finkel, 1995). Together    these yield  m =450 yr, with  s  = 220 yr. The derived coefficient    of variation of 0.5 is in accord with observations for faults with longer paleoseismic    records, such as the southern San Andreas (Working Group on California Earthquake    Probabilities, 1995). The time  t  elapsed between the 1939-67 sequence    and the previous events in 1254-1668 is taken to be ~425 yr (a weighted average)    in a 450± 220-year cycle. For the Poisson calculation (eq 2) the earthquake    rate  r  is taken as 1/ m . The stressing rate in our model is 0.15    bar yr-1 along most of the North Anatolian fault system ( Fig.    2 b ).      The fault slip rate of 24 mm/yr, an average secular stressing rate of 0.15    bar/yr, and repeat time of 450 years, give a mean slip of 11 m per event and    mean stress drop of 68 bars. During the twentieth century, the slip and stress    drops are lower than this estimate except for the 1939 earthquake, suggesting    that we may have overestimated the repeat time and thus underestimated the earthquake    probability. This could arise if some large earthquakes are missing from the    historical record. To examine the impact of overestimating the repeat time,    and to define a range of probabilities appropriate to the observations, we also    calculate probabilities a using an alternate set of parameters with repeat time.    We arbitrarily halve the repeat time, leaving the coefficient of variation at    0.5. Thus  m =225 yr,  s =110 yr. For these calculations, for the    elapsed time we use the time since the great 1668 earthquake ( Fig.    7 ), so  t =271 yr. The mean recurrence time of 225 years gives a mean    event slip of 5.4 m per event and mean stress drop of 34 bars.      For the time interval used in this study,  Dt =10   years, the first    set of parameters ( m =450 yr,  s =220 yr,  t =450 yr) give generic    segment probabilities of 0.022 and 0.036 for the Poisson and conditional probability    models, respectively, and the second set of parameters ( m =225 yr,  s =110    yr,  t =271 yr) give generic segment probabilities of 0.044 and 0.130 for    the Poisson and conditional probability models, respectively. Because the elapsed    times are close to the mean recurrence times, the conditional probabilities    are larger than the Poisson probabilities for both parameter sets.          Permanent effect of Stress Change          Increasing ( or decreasing ) the Coulomb stress on a fault segment permanently shortens ( or lengthens ) the time required for tectonic stressing to bring a segment to failure (Fig. 6a), and thus causes a permanent change in conditional probability. The conditional probability model can be adapted to estimate the effect of stress changes by equating a stress change with the time required to accumulate stress through secular stressing.        Two very similar methods have been proposed to estimate the effect of a stress    increase on the conditional probability. The first method advances the elapsed    time in the conditional probability calculation (eqs 3-5) from  t  to     t'  by the equivalent time required to accumulate the stress step  Ds     through the secular stressing process (Dieterich, 1988)                          ,         (6)       where  is tectonic stressing rate. The second approach reduces the expected median recurrence time from  m  to  m ' by the equivalent time required to accumulate the stress step through the secular stressing process (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 1990)                                                                   ,                      ,         (7)       Reducing  m  or increasing  t  for a positive step in stress increases    the conditional probability of an earthquake ( Fig.    6 b ,  dotted to dashed lines ). We have employed eq (7) in computing    conditional probabilities following a stress step, because it is consistent    with the concept that recurrence time is reduced by a step increase in stress.    Both methods yield similar results, though eq (7) yields larger changes of probability    for a given stress step. Segment probabilities following the stress step are    given in Table 4 ( col. 5 ) for the first parameter set, and in Table 5    ( col. 5 ) for the second parameter set.           Transient effect of Stress Change          The existence of foreshocks and aftershocks demonstrate that when an earthquake occurs there is a large transient increase in the probability of additional earthquakes in the surrounding area. Similarly, global statistics of earthquake pairs reveal strong clustering in space and time, in which the occurrence of one earthquake increases the probability of a second earthquake, with the probability decaying with time and distance from the first event (Kagan and Jackson, 1991). These transient increases of earthquake probabilities are among the most prominent of statistical features of earthquake occurrence. A quantitative and unified explanation of aftershock distributions and decay, global clustering statistics, and foreshock statistics, is given by a single model in which the rate of earthquake occurrence is perturbed by the local stress increase caused by a prior earthquake (Dieterich, 1994; Dieterich & Kilgore, 1996). We employ this model to calculate this transient change of the segment earthquake probabilities.      The model is based on the constitutive formulation for rate of earthquake    activity proposed by Dieterich (1994), derived from laboratory observations    of rate- and state-dependent fault properties. Rate- and state-dependence of    fault properties has been observed for a diverse variety of materials over the    range of conditions for crustal earthquakes. Numerical simulations using these    fault constitutive properties reproduce the full range of observed fault slip    phenomena, including laboratory observations of spontaneous time-dependent nucleation    of slip instabilities over a range of stresses above some minimum critical stress    level, and healing following slip (Dieterich and Kilgore, 1996). A consequence    of clustering statistics and time-dependent nucleation is that earthquake rates    at all magnitudes undergo a strong transient amplification at the time of a    step increase of stress, followed by 1/ t  decay to their background rate    ( Fig. 6 b ).         Because the transient effect of the stress change is expressed as a change in expected rate of segment events, it is convenient to formulate the probability analysis as a non-stationary Poisson process. Generalizing eq (2) gives                             ,         (8)       where,  Pn  is the net probability, which combines the transient and    permanent effects of the stress change on earthquake probability and  R ( t )    is now a non-constant (decaying) earthquake rate following a stress step.  Dt     is measured from the time of the stress step; we use 10 years for these computations.    To evaluate eq (8), we obtain  N , by integrating the solution for     R ( t ) following a stress step (Dieterich, 1994; his eq 12). For    the interval 0 to  Dt , this yields                          ,         (9)       where  r  is the permanent background component of the earthquake rate    following the stress step ( Fig.    6 b ),  ta  is the characteristic duration of the transient effect,    and  Dsf  is the calculated Coulomb stress change.  A  is a dimensionless    fault constitutive parameter and  s  is the effective normal stress. Since     ta  and  As  are unknown for the Anatolia sequence, we set  ta     = 10.2 yr, the value derived from pair clusters in the Harvard CMT global catalog    for M>5 earthquakes at depths<70 km, and  As =1 bar from analyses    of aftershocks and foreshocks (Dieterich, 1994). Note that the transient effect    disappears if  Dsf  = 0, that is  N  =  r Dt .      In eq (9)  r  is the rate of activity implicit to the conditional probability following the stress step (Tables 4 and 5,  col. 6 ). Hence, to evaluate  r  we equate the value of the conditional probability to a stationary Poisson probability and solve for  r . From  eq (2),                         (10)      where,  P  is the previously obtained conditional probability for the    fault segment following the stress step.     In summary, the net probability of events rupturing each fault segment (Tables 4 and 5,  col. 7 ) combines both the permanent and transient effects of a stress step. Net probability is obtained by first computing the permanent effect of a stress change on the conditional probability using the approach of eq (7). Then the equivalent Poisson rate  r  for the permanent effect is obtained using eq (10) to evaluate eqs (8) and (9) for the net probability.     For completeness we noted that eq (9) assumes the background rate  r     after the stress step, is constant over the interval  Dt , which it is    not. Conditional probability grows slowly with elapsed time, requiring an increase    of  r  with time ( Fig.    6 b ). However, for the Anatolian computations the change of  r     over  Dt =10 years is small relative to the magnitude of  r,  and    the resulting error introduced by this approximation is slight. In cases where     Dt  is large relative to the repeat time  T,  and where higher accuracy    in the application of eq (9) is sought, the time interval can be broken into     n  sub-intervals, . The conditional probabilities  Pi , and expected    number of events  Ni  are computed as before, for each sub-interval  i .     Pn  for the entire interval is then given by                          ,         (11)      where  Pn 1 etc. are the net probabilities obtained for each sub-interval.    Using the definition  Pni =1-exp( Ni ), eq (11) can be written as                              ,         (12)      where  N = N1 + N2 + ..  Nn  .        Net Probability Gain          The probability gain associated with the stress step is the net probability for some period after a stress increase, divided by the conditional probability prior to the step  (Aki, 1981). The probability gains for the two sets of parameters are listed in Tables 4 and 5 ( col. 8 ). Note that  although net probabilities are very different for the two assumed repeat times, each set of recurrence parameters yields similar probability gains. It is also apparent that about 95% of the 10-yr gain is caused by the transient effect. In other words, both aftershocks and subsequent mainshocks are more likely in the stressed areas during the first decade after each large shock. We find an average three-fold gain in the probability of an  M >=6.7 earthquake during the decade after each triggering event, with a wide range for individual triggers of 1-19.      LIMITATIONS OF THE ANALYSIS        Although we incorporate stress changes caused by earthquakes and secular fault    slip, we make several assumptions that influence our results. Earthquake slip    measured at the surface may under-represent the net slip at depth, and thus    the stress change, by as much as 50%. Surface slip occasionally exceeds the    slip at depth, as at the north end of the 1992  M =7.4 Landers, California,    earthquake (Wald & Heaton, 1994) , so the calculated stress beyond the fault    ends can also be too large. Our assumed 12.5-km depth of coseismic slip is consistent    with the 1992 Erzincan earthquake (Barka & Eyidogan, 1993; Bennett, et al.,    1996; Nablant,  et al. , 1996), but it is unknown for the preceding events.    The deep slip rate used for the secular model is also uncertain by ±8 mm/yr    (95% confidence) (Oral, 1994). In addition, we neglect two time-dependent effects:    Pore-fluid flow could raise m' with time, as suggested by Harris & Simpson    (1992), Jaumé & Sykes (1992), and Scholz (1990) , which would increase    the stress changes by up to 25% (Table 2,  col. 2 ). Postseismic asthenospheric    relaxation also transfers stress to the upper crust. An 12.5-km-thick elastic    plate overlying an inviscid fluid approximates complete relaxation of the lower    crust; this yields stresses twice as high and twice as broad as those calculated    here (Stein,  et al. , 1992). Thus most processes we omit would, if included,    increase the calculated stress transfer and associated probability gains.     Several assumptions introduce uncertainty into our probability calculations. To estimate the permanent stress effects, we used a common repeat and elapsed time for large earthquakes on the Anatolian fault, whereas repeat times for the better studied San Andreas fault differ by nearly a factor of two between the northern and southern segments. For the transient probability effects, we relied upon global average values for the key parameters because we lacked local information for Anatolia. Based on analyses of earthquakes elsewhere, these parameters could differ by ±50%. Fortunately, the probability gains listed in Tables 4 and 5 ( col. 8 ) are less sensitive to these assumptions than the probabilities, particularly during the first decade after each triggering earthquake when transient effects are large.              IMPLICATIONS FOR EARTHQUAKE FORECASTING        We identify several faults with an heightened probability of failure. The    port city of Izmit is most vulnerable to an earthquake on the Sapanca fault    ( Fig. 4 g ).    Stress increases of 1.3-2.5 bars are found for the Geyve and Sapanca faults,    which pose the greatest threat to Istanbul, particularly if the faults ruptured    from east to west. The Sapanca fault last ruptured in 1878. We calculate a 30-yr    probability during 1996-2026 for  M >=6.7 shocks on the Geyve and Sapanca    fault segments to be 12%; this probability is higher by a factor of 1.07 than    the rate before the these segments were stressed by the 1967 earthquake. The    Yedisu (last rupture in 1784), Ovacik, and Göynük (last event in 1866)    faults near Erzincan have been stressed toward failure by 1.7-9.2 bars. Erzincan,    badly damaged during the 1939 and 1992 earthquakes, would be most affected if    these faults ruptured toward the city ( Fig.    4 g ). We calculate a 30-yr probability during 1996-2026 for M³6.7    shocks on the Yedisu segment to be 15%; this is a factor of 1.35 higher than    the rate before the these segments were stressed by the 1992 Erzincan earthquake.     The Anatolian findings complement studies of the triggering of main shocks, aftershocks, and fault creep in California. The 1992  M =7.4 Landers earthquake was calculated to have increased the stress by 1.5-3.0 bars where the  M =6.5 Big Bear shock struck 3.5 h after the Landers main shock, and 65% of the Landers M³1 aftershocks occurred where the stress rose by >0.3 bars (King, et al., 1994) . The Landers earthquake increased the stress 40 km away on the San Andreas fault by an estimated 2-6 bars (Harris & Simpson, 1992; Jaumé & Sykes, 1992; Stein, et al., 1992) , with ~150 mm slip needed to relieve the imposed stress (King, et al., 1994) . Subsequent GPS (Shen,  et al. , 1994)  and continuous strain (Wyatt,  et al. , 1994)  measurements indicate that deep slip on the San Andreas fault of 115±47 mm occurred where the stress was calculated to have risen, and slip of -39±33 mm where the stress was calculated to have dropped, in close accord with the calculation. Stress changes associated with several other California earthquakes influenced subsequent seismicity (Jaumé & Sykes, 1996; Harris & Simpson, 1996; Harris, et al., 1995; Simpson & Reasenberg, 1994; Stein, et al., 1994) . Together, these results attest that faults are sensitive to small but sustained stress changes transmitted over tens to hundreds of kilometers.     The North Anatolia fault has experienced several historical episodes of migrating    earthquake sequences ( Fig.    7 ). Large earthquakes progressed ~250 km eastward during 967, 1035, and    1050 A.D. (Ambraseys, 1970). A sequence ruptured perhaps 700 km of the fault    during 1650±20 to 1668 (Ikeda, et al., 1991; Ambraseys & Finkel, 1995).    We suggest that the propensity of the fault zone toward progressive failure    is a product of its simple, straight geometry, which, as seen in  Fig.    4 , makes for efficient transfer of stress; its isolation from other faults,    which minimizes stress transferred between the North Anatolian and competing    faults; and its en echelon character (Wesnousky, 1988) , which tends to keep    the entire fault from rupturing at once (Fig. 1c). By contrast, the San    Andreas fault, which lacks an historical record of progressive shocks, produces    larger earthquakes along its smoother trace, and generally lies close to other    major faults, making the stress transfer more irregular and complex.       CONCLUSIONS        We find that earthquake-induced stress increases of several bars promoted the North Anatolia earthquake sequence, each shock raising the probability of future earthquakes at the site of the next to strike. Our analysis is least successful in explaining the occurrence of the 1943 earthquake and the absence of a Yedisu segment earthquake. Nor do we account for the time lag between individual triggers and ruptures, which varied from months to decades.     Our results suggest that earthquakes interact: When a large shocks occurs, it changes the conditions for failure in its vicinity, altering the probabilities for future events. In contrast, current approaches to earthquake hazard generally assume a stationary Poisson process where the past behavior of large faults is unknown, in which earthquakes are assumed to occur randomly over time on a fault. Where more information is available, the time-predictable model (Shimazaki & Nakata, 1980)  is employed, in which the probability of an earthquake of specified size and location drops after the rupture but does not change elsewhere. Ward (1996)  considered the permanent effects of stress transfer in a synthetic seismicity model for southern California, finding significant fault interactions, as we do here. Two seismic hazard analysis for the San Andreas system (Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities, 1990; Working Group on the Probabilities of future large earthquakes in southern California, 1992)  considered Coulomb stress changes, but only for the permanent effect associated with the most recent large earthquake in the region. In contrast, we find that the transient effect dominates during the first decade after the triggering event, contributing both to the production of aftershocks and to the higher likelihood of subsequent mainshocks. This result may help to explain a stress-triggering paradox in southern California: For small-moderate southern California earthquakes since 1932, the influence of Coulomb stress changes were discernible for <5 yr  (Harris, et al., 1995) , but persisted for 50 yr following the great 1857  M =7.8 earthquake in the same region (Harris & Simpson, 1996) . The transient effect decays within 5-10 years for large and small shocks alike, but only large shocks substantially perturb the permanent probabilities, and so their influence persists long after the transient effect subsides.     Clustering of strong shocks is the outstanding feature of seismicity over    historical (Kagan & Jackson, 1991) and paleoseismic (Wallace, 1987) time    periods. Clustering implies that the prospect of a large earthquake rises after    a large event. Stress transfer offers a physical explanation for earthquake    clustering and migration: stress drops on the slipped fault but rises at other    sites nearby, bringing faults in these regions closer to failure. Coulomb stress    calculations thus capture the most salient feature of earthquake distributions,    and gives insight as to where the next event is more likely to strike    .

( a )          Active faults in Turkey (Barka, 1992; Saroglu & Kusçu, 1992;        Sengor,  et al. , 1985), with the North Anatolian fault in bold. GPS        observations establish a 24±4 mm/yr (1s confid.) deep slip rate on        the North Anatolian fault and reveal that the right-lateral transform describes        a small circle about a (33.4±0.5°E, 31.1±1.3°N) Anatolia-Eurasia        rotation pole, which lies at the intersection of the dashed red lines (Oral,        1994) . ( b ) Cumulative right-lateral slip associated with  M >=6.7        earthquakes (Barka, 1995; Barka & Eyidogan, 1993; Bennett, et al., 1996)        ; the sequence ruptured from warm to cool colors. Slip in the 1949, 1966,        and 1971 shocks is approximate, and the reverse-slip component for the Ezine        and Kursunlu faults is not shown. ( c ) The region inscribed by the        solid red line in  a  is projected relative to the Anatolia-Eurasia        rotation pole, so that a transform fault would strike due east-west; the        North Anatolian fault is seen to deviate less than 40 km from being a simple        right-lateral transform.                                Fig. 2 . Secular        slip model used to calculate the loading of the North Anatolian fault system.        ( a ) Steady deep slip below 12.5 km, as inferred from GPS observations        (Le Pichon, et al., 1993; Oral, 1994; Oral,  et al. , 1997; Straub        & Kahle, 1994; Straub, 1996) transfers stress to the seismogenic portion        of the fault. The model shown, projected relative to the pole of rotation        as in  Fig. 1 c ,        is used for the Coulomb stress changes on optimally oriented faults ( Fig.        3 .  Fig. 4 ,        and  Fig. 5 ); an        identical model projected in UTM coordinates, as in  Fig.        1 a , is used for the stress changes resolved on specific faults        (Tables 1-3). ( b ) The secular stress rate is resolved on the fault        at the indicated points, and also calculated for optimally oriented vertical        strike-slip faults (color gradients). Deep slip and stress is distributed        between two strands at the west end of the fault.                           Fig. 3 . Stress        changes associated with the 1939 earthquake. (a) Coulomb stress change on        major faults caused by the 1939 earthquake. Stress is resolved on the fault        surface, projected in UTM coordinates, at a depth of 8 km. Faults are assumed        to be vertical, except for the west end of the 1939 rupture, which dips        50° N. No information about the regional stress is needed for this        calculation. The mean stress change along the future 1942 rupture is +1.4        bars. (b) Color gradients show the Coulomb stress change on optimally oriented        vertical strike-slip faults at a depth of 8 km. The calculation assumes        that the regional stress is 100 bars compression oriented 55° clockwise        from the local Anatolian fault strike. Large rotations of the optimal planes        are restricted close to the fault rupture, where the earthquake stress change        is significant relative to the regional stress. Far from the 1939 rupture,        rotation of the optimal planes is negligible.                       Fig. 4 . Cumulative        stress changes caused by large earthquakes and steady deep slip on the North        Anatolian fault since 1939. In each panel, the epicenter of the next earthquake        to rupture is circled. All but the 1943 epicenter lie in regions where the        stress rose significantly, typically by 2-5 bars, owing to the foregoing        shocks and deep fault slip. Relocated ISC earthquakes (Engdahl,  et al. ,        1996) are shown in  g , with the 1992 Erzincan aftershock sequence        removed. Calculations are made in an elastic halfspace with a shear modulus        of 3.15 x 1011 dyne-cm-2 and Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Earthquake slip is        assigned as in  Fig.        1 b , assumed to be uniform over 0-12.5-km depth. The fault was        digitized and stress was sampled at 5-km increments, and is projected as        in Fig. 1c so that the regional stress maintains nearly a fixed angle        to the fault.                       Fig.        5 . Stress changes at the east end of the North Anatolian fault caused        by 1939 and 1949 earthquakes (Ambraseys, 1988) . To emphasize the earthquake        stress transfer, secular stress accumulation is not included in this plot;        its inclusion would simply raise the stress along the North and East Anatolian        faults by 1-1.4 bars. Projection as in  Fig.        4 . (a) The 1939 and 1949 earthquakes highly stress the sites of the        future 1966 and 1971 earthquakes. Most segments that did not subsequently        rupture were brought farther from failure except for the Yedisu segment.        (b) Most aftershocks or small earthquakes occur in regions where the stress        change on optimally-oriented strike slip faults was raised by the 1939-49        earthquakes. The optimal orientations for right- and left-lateral faults        off the 1949 rupture zone is shown with the assumed regional stress direction,        sr. Earthquakes from 1964 from Engdahl, et al. (1996) are shown, rather        than from 1949, because of the poor network quality before 1964.                       Fig. 6 .

( a )        The stress increase advances the time to the next rupture. If the stress        were closer to failure at the time of the stress step, the trigger might        have triggered an earthquake immediately. ( b ) The associated short-term        ( transient ) and long-term ( permanent ) probability gain (Dieterich        & Kilgore, 1996) . The transient gain (curved portion of solid line)        scales with the rate of aftershock decay, and the permanent gain (dashed        to solid line) is typically a factor of 1.12 higher than the probability        before the triggers the Anatolian sequence.

Rupture        zones for large historical earthquakes along the North and East Anatolian        faults (Ambraseys & Finkel, 1988; Ambraseys & Finkel, 1995; Barka,        1992; Ikeda et al., 1991) . Zones for earthquakes before 1939 are based        largely on isoseismals, and are thus approximate. Earthquake progressions,        indicated by arrows, occurred during three sequences but in different directions        and rates.                    TABLE 1.

Faults were digitized at 5-km increments, with calculations performed with the    fault projected in UTM coordinates, as in  Fig.    1 a . The stress change shown for the 1942 earthquake assumes that    the Ezine fault ( Fig.    1 c ) has a 50°-N dip and a 1:1 right-reverse-slip component (if    the Ezine is treated as a vertical strike-slip fault, the mean change on the    1942 rupture zone is -6.0 bars and the epicentral change is -3.0 bars). The    stress transferred by the 1951 earthquake is calculated for the 60°N-dipping    Kursunlu thrust fault (Pinar, 1953) , although the epicenter could lie on the    North Anatolian fault. The epicentral stress for m'=0.75 gives results for low    pore fluid pressure.                     TABLE 3.

GX009-23-5558383	"Volume 5, Number 1     January/February 1997         Advanced Technologies           Quake Forecast Data With GPS      NETWORK OF 250 NASA GLOBAL POSITIONING   System (GPS) receivers will help students and researchers forecast Los Angeles-area   earthquakes. Students will help gather and analyze data.     NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin recently dedicated a new site in the Southern   California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN) at Rialto High School.     ""This network is a tremendous example of how technology developed for space benefits life   on Earth. This interagency project will give us detailed information never before available   to track the invisible geologic strains and stresses that lie beneath the California   landscape,"" Goldin said. ""Such data should give us fresh insight into the forces that   produce earthquakes and could one day help reduce the loss of life and property from such   disasters.""     GPS uses data transmitted from a constellation of 24 Earth-orbiting satellites arranged so   several are visible from any point on the Earth's surface at any time. Someone using a GPS   receiver can determine the site's precise location by coordinating signals from the   satellites.     ""GPS is the most important new technology to emerge for the study of earthquakes in   decades. This information will permit us to improve our estimates of the regional   earthquake hazard in Southern California and to prioritize earthquake mitigation   activities, including emergency preparedness and retrofit strategies,"" said Dr. Tom Henyey,   director of the USGS-NSF Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) in Los Angeles.     ""The GPS network will continuously measure movements of the Earths crust with a precision   of one millimeter per year, which will show us where strain is building up,"" said Dr.   Andrea Donnellan, a member of the SCIGN Coordinating Committee at Jet Propulsion Laboratory   (JPL).     SCIGN began in 1990 with four GPS receivers as a NASA-funded prototype project. It detected   very small motions of the Earth's crust in Southern California associated with the   June 1992 Landers and January 1994 Northridge earthquakes.     Currently, SCIGN has 40 GPS receivers operating. The remaining receivers will be installed   over the next three years.     ""With data from the 40 receivers, we have determined that Southern California has continued   to move since the Northridge quake in 1994. This may mean that stress is being relieved in   part without earthquakes, which may reduce the overall earthquake hazard,"" Donnellan said.     GPS data helps identify active buried faults that do not reach ground surface, and GPS   measurements are useful in characterizing earthquake damage. Agencies can monitor off-site   probable damage to dams, bridges and buildings via receivers placed on or near the   structures.

Clicking on a station code will take you to a plot of the north, east and up components  of the station as a function of time.    The station velocities are in an itrf97-NA-fixed reference frame. The reference frame is described more fully under the Summary Info button on each station page. See  gp processing . for more information about the processing. Please read disclaimer below.      Disclaimer:       Be advised that these results are preliminary.  The station positions are unchecked and should not be used for any engineering applications. There may be errors in the antenna heights.  The velocities are very dependent on the length of the span of observations. The presence of outliers (errant observations) sometimes contaminates the velocities.   Caveat emptor.

A complex web of active faults slice through southern California,                making it a fascinating target for seismic and geologic study. Not                only does the great San Andreas fault transit this region, but here                it takes an enormous 40° bend between the Cajon and Tejon Passes                ( click                on the map below to find those places ). One of California’s                largest historical events, the great 1857 shock, ruptured 300 km                of the San Andreas fault from Cajon Pass in the southeast to 80                km north of Tejon Pass. To the southwest of the bend, ribbons of                secondary strike slip fault conceal hidden or ‘blind’                thrust faults at depth, along which the 1971 M=6.7 San Fernando                and 1994 M=6.7 Northridge events struck. To the northeast of the                bend, another band of strike-slip and normal faults extend into                the Mojave Desert, and are collectively termed the Eastern California                shear zone. The 1992 M=7.3 Landers and 1999 M=7.1 Hector Mine shocks                occurred there.                                                                                                                                                           What are we up to?               Our work has focused on several aspects of the earthquake process                in southern California (click on the map to see the complete references).                Grant Marshall and Ross Stein created three  35mm slides  that                summarize the effects the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Ross Stein                and Tom Hanks reassessed the  catalog                of earthquakes  to see if there is a ‘seismic moment deficit’                that will soon be filled by more vigorous earthquake activity; instead                they found a deficit neither for the rate of large shocks nor for                the seismic moment ( Stein                and Hanks, 1998 ). Tom Parsons and Ross Stein studied how the                earthquakes interact, one triggering another. In several papers,                we have examined the San Fernando, Northridge, Landers, Homestead                Valley, Joshua Tree, Big Bear, and Hector Mine shocks. Chuck Wicks                and Wayne Thatcher studied the Coso volcanic field to track the                ground movement caused by inflation of a magma chamber beneath the                geothermal field ( Wicks                et al. 2001 ). Gerald Bawden, Wayne Thatcher, Ross Stein and                Ken Hudnut used InSAR imagery and GPS data to identify and remove                the large seasonal and long-term deformation of the earth’s                surface caused by pumping for water and oil ( Bawden                et al. 2001 ). This work reveals the component of deformation                that must be accommodated by the mysterious but threatening blind                thrust faults in greater Los Angeles.                                                                                           Because the region is heavily populated and seismically active,                there is a wealth of monitoring networks in place, such as the seismic                 TerraScope                 and the  Southern                California Seismic Network , and the  Southern                California Integrated GPS Network . In addition, a series of                major seismic experiments such as  LARSE                 I and II, and the collaboration of institutions participating in                the   Southern California Earthquake                Center , provide one of the world’s best laboratories to                study earthquake occurrence.                                                                                                      Homepage                |    Site              Index   |    Contact              Us   |    About              Us   |    USGS              Earthquake News Releases                                                                                               U.S.          Geological Survey, Earthquake Hazards Program          URL http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/research/deformation/modeling/socal/          Page maintained by Serkan Bozkurt          Webmaster:  sbozkurt@usgs.gov          Last modification:           November 21, 2002

The Basin and Range Province is a high elevation, internally drained              region of the western United States that is currently experiencing              active tectonic deformation ( Figure              1 ). The province extends south through Arizona and into Mexico,              and north into Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. The region is actively              extending in the East/West direction. In other words, the state of              California moves away from Colorado, (roughly ""stable"" North              America) at approximately 1 cm/year.               Our group uses extremely precise space-based geodetic methods,                such as the Global Positioning System ( GPS )                to measure these tiny tectonic motions of the Earth's crust. Currently                we can measure velocities as small as a few millimeters per year.                                                                                      Figure 1 (96 kb).                     Shown are locations were data is being collected in GPS campaigns                    (red triangles). We concentrate our measurements in regions                    of active deformation, i.e. where the continent is changing                    shape the fastest. Also our arrays are quasi-linear, crossing                    active geologic strucutures in order to maximize the amount                    of deformation seen. The dotted line shows the approximate perimeter                    of the Basin and Range                                             The scientific objectives of our research include the detailed                mapping of velocities throughout the Basin and Range, and other                tectonically interesting portions of the West. With these geodetic                measurements we can identify and characterize the regions that are                actively deforming. This will allow us to better constrain seismic                hazard in the interior western US where geodetic data is currently                sparse, and will contribute to our understanding of the reasons                for the deformation. For example, GPS velocity measurements can                assess how far the tractions from the Pacific plate are transferred                into North America. See the enclosed paper by  Thatcher                et al, [1999]  for greater detail.                This effort will be complemented by quantitative modeling of the                crustal deformation. For example, the use of finite element analysis                provides a means of applying physical constraints to the problem                of inferring Earth properties from a geodetic signal. This allows                us to rigorously test models for Earth processes against the observations.                               This work is done in conjunction with a multi-institution initiative                known as  The Plate                Boundary Observatory  whose goal is to evaluate the deformation                the entire Pacific/North American plate boundary in unprecedented                detail and scope.

GX065-36-12073469	December 04, 2003   Progress, Promise in Space-Based Earthquake Research   Nearly 10 years after Los Angeles was shaken by the devastating, magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake, scientists at NASA and other institutions say maturing space-based technologies, new ground-based techniques and more complex computer models are rapidly advancing our understanding of earthquakes and earthquake processes.   Dr. Andrea Donnellan, a geophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., says the past decade has seen substantial progress in space-based earthquake research. “We’ve confirmed through space observation the Earth’s surface is constantly moving, periodically resulting in earthquakes, and we can measure both the seismically quiet motions before and after earthquakes, as well as the earthquakes themselves,” she explains. “These technologies are allowing us to pursue lines of data and research we didn’t know existed only a few years ago.”   Two months before the Northridge earthquake, Donnellan and university colleagues published a paper in the journal Nature on ground deformation north of Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley. Six years of Global Positioning System (GPS) data showed the area’s faults were active and building up strain, and indicated the size and style of a potential earthquake there. Following the earthquake, the data made it possible to rapidly determine where the fault ruptured and to measure how the earthquake had deformed the Earth’s surface.   Space-based instruments can image Earth movements to within fractions of an inch, measuring the slow buildup of deformation along faults, and mapping ground deformation after an earthquake. Two primary tools are the space-based GPS navigation system and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). The latter compares satellite radar images of Earth taken at different times to detect ground movement.   InSAR complements surface measurements because it lets us look at whole regions in a spatial context. An InSAR mission is also a key component of EarthScope, a jointly led initiative by the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).   EarthScope studies the North American continent’s structure and evolution, and the physical processes that control earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, according to Dr. James Whitcomb, section head for Special Projects, Earth Sciences Division, National Science Foundation, Arlington, Va.   Precise Earth surface-movement data measure strain, and provide a first approximation of where earthquakes are likely to occur, notes Dr. Brad Hager, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor and co-author of the 1993 Nature paper. “In California, patterns of ground deformation are complicated by the complex interactions between fault systems,” he says. “Interpreting this data requires computer models that can estimate how much deformation has accumulated and identify regions where strain should be released, but hasn’t been.”   University of California, Davis, researcher Dr. John Rundle says the complexity of earthquakes requires we study them as part of the full Earth system. “Most natural events result from interrelated Earth processes over various lengths and times,” he adds. “These processes have variables that can’t be readily observed, so understanding them requires computers.”   NASA’s QuakeSim project is developing a similar forecasting methodology. Its tools simulate earthquake processes, and manage and model the increasing quantities of dataavailable. “We’re focusing on observing and understanding earthquakes in space and time, and developing methods that use patterns of small earthquakes to forecast larger ones,” Rundle explains. “New simulations of earthquakes on California’s active faults are providing considerable insight, showing earthquakes tend to “cluster” in space and time due to their interactions: that is, an earthquake on one fault section can turn on or off earthquake activity on nearby fault sections, depending on the relative orientation of the faults. Simulations have led researchers to conclude that fault system geometry determines earthquake activity patterns.”   A NASA/Department of Energy-funded research team reports promising results from an experiment to forecast earthquakes in southern/central California from 2000 to 2010. It uses mathematical methods to forecast likely locations of earthquakes above magnitude 5 by processing data on earthquakes of about magnitude 3 from the past decade. The high-risk regions identified in the forecast are refined from those already identified by the government as susceptible to large earthquakes. Five earthquakes greater than magnitude 5 have occurred since the research was completed, all in those high-risk regions.   Dr. Wayne Thatcher, a senior research geophysicist at the USGS, Menlo Park, Calif., says as these technologies are validated they will be transferred to end users. “Such data and models improve understanding of earthquake and volcanic processes, substantially refining seismic hazard maps and resulting in more appropriate, earthquake-resistant construction codes and more targeted retrofitting strategies,” he says.

The USGS recognizes                that risks from geologic                hazards can be lessened                by education and strategic                planning. This project                will create and provide                geologic information systems                data for use by private                and public entities to                include in their hazards                reduction programs.                              Urban                Structures                Contact:  Erdal                Safak , 626-583-7223               Shaking                generated by earthquakes                in the urban environment                damages bridges, highways,                office buildings, power                transmission lines, gas                and water lines, train                tracks, storage buildings,                airport runways, and the                individual home or apartment.                The financial cost of interrupted                business, in addition to                actual repair costs, is                a significant part of the                earthquake hazard that                must be considered. Investigations                have begun to more carefully                document the seismic response                and characteristics of                critical structures in                Seattle. This data will                be used to predict shaking                response and to both retrofit                existing structures and                to design future structures                to better withstand the                forces from a large earthquake                near the urban corridor.                  Contacts               Directory                of earthquake hazards researchers.                                                                                                                                                          U.S.          Geological Survey, a bureau of          the  U.S.          Department of the Interior                     This page is brought to you by          the Earthquake Hazards Program          URL: http://geohazards.cr.usgs.gov/pacnw/objectives.html          Maintained by:  Web          Team          Last modification:           Friday, 20-Jun-2003  9:40                              USGS  Privacy          Statement  | |  Disclaimer           | |  FOIA           | |            Accessibility

GX015-09-4753863	24. Automated Near-Real-Time Analysis of Continuous  GPS  Data in the San Francisco Bay Area for Deformation Alerts  The planned release of the Working Group 2002 report on the earthquake   likelihood in the San Francisco Bay area will renew public focus on how the    USGS  will follow up its identification of high hazard with vigilant and   heightened monitoring. Near-real-time analysis of the Bay area's  U.C.    Berkeley- USGS   BARD  network is not only a responsible answer to this need,   but also a valuable research tool to investigate complex time-dependent   deformation associated with seismic and aseismic slip as well as   viscoelastic rebound following larger events.   The setting for such an automated system is the establishment over the past   5 years of continuous  GPS  networks in southern and northern California   (respectively,  BARD  and  SCIGN ), the Pacific Northwest ( PANGA ), and the   central Basin and Range province ( BARGN ). These continuously recording   networks have created new research opportunities and burdens. For the first   time, a near-real-time data stream is available to monitor the surface   displacements associated with strain accumulation and release. But this   fire-hose of data threatens to make obsolete the traditional process by   which one sifts observations or time series for coherent signals to model   and interpret. The goal of this Fellowship is to develop an automatic   near-real time filtering and analysis system for continuous- GPS  network   data, so that accelerating or expanding creep events, and slow and silent   earthquakes, can be identified and flagged while in progress. An ancillary   goal is that post-earthquake analysis could be conducted with a speed in   tandem with the  USGS  web-served ShakeMaps. This would permit preliminary   earthquake dislocation models to be posted almost as rapidly as the shaking   maps.   Once the pilot system is established to work reliably for the  BARD  network,   we propose to make the technology available for other  GPS  networks, and to   encourage the Fellow to demonstrate the efficacy of the system to other   network managers. Such networks include  PANGA , spanning northernmost   California to southern Canada, site of the well-documented slow earthquakes   in the Cascadia subduction zone, and volcanic deformation associated with   Cascades volcanoes. The Fellow would also be encouraged to model the   signals captured by this system to explore the processes of time-dependent   deformation for the insights they bring to earthquake occurrence and   interaction.   Desirable skills include computer programming (Fortran, C, or Visual Basic) to develop UNIX and Windows applications for analyzing earth science datasets, and the use of MatLab software, computer graphics, and geographic information systems ( GIS ) such as  GMT  or Arc Info. The applicant should also have demonstrated ability to communicate both orally and in writing research results in geophysics (presentations at professional meetings and published research reports).

Click on any figure to enlarge.                                                    Motions of earth's tectonic plates cause earthquakes along plate boundaries             Subduction, or underthrusting of the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate beneath the continent at about 36 mm/yr (~1.5 in/yr) produces three kinds of quakes:          Great thrust earthquakes  along the 1000 km-long plate boundary fault beneath the continental shelf (1700 AD Cascadia, M 9; and much smaller 1992 Cape Mendocino, M 7)   Deep earthquakes  in the downgoing slab, where it bends beneath the continent (1949 Olympia, M 7; 1965 Tacoma M 6.5; 1999 Satsop, M 5.9)   Shallow earthquakes  on crustal faults in western Oregon and Washington (900 AD Seattle, M 7; 1993 Scotts Mills, M 5.6; Klamath Falls, M 6).        Geologic and historical evidence for the first two kinds of earthquakes is abundant. Shallow earthquakes and faulting in PNW are poorly known and are the focus of much current research.                      Shallow earthquakes are part of a larger picture. Cascadia and its small plates are caught between N. America and the much larger Pacific plate, which is moving NW at 51 mm/yr (about 2 in/yr)               As a result:       The western U.S., including Cascadia is deforming over a broad area.    The continental margin and the Juan de Fuca plate are breaking up into smaller crustal blocks that are being dragged northward by the motion of the Pacific plate.    Migrating continental margin terranes breaking up into: Washington (W), Oregon Coastal (OC), and Sierra Nevada (SN) blocks.    Vancouver Island (VI) and Canadian Coast Mountains represent a relatively fixed buttress against which coastal terranes are deformed.                                    How do we recognize the coastal blocks?                           Geology and geophysics help define block boundaries         The earth's gravity is high over hard, dense, crustal blocks (red colors) and low over soft, less dense rocks (blue colors).     Dense, accreted basalt forms much of the crust of the Coast Range.  Offshore are softer, offscraped sedimentary rocks and basins filling the Cascadia trench.     Coastal Oregon appears to be one large block, sometimes called a microplate; Washington appears to be several small, fault-bounded blocks.                   Faults, volcanoes, and earthquakes occur along  block margins                  Block margins are zones of active faulting, seismicity, and volcanism.     The interior of the large Oregon coastal block is relatively quiet.     In contrast, Western Washington  is seismically active, and earthquakes indicate N-S compression.     Volcanoes are most abundant on the eastern edge of the rotating Oregon block, a zone of crustal extension.                   Magnetic directions frozen in ancient lava flows during cooling show rotation of coastal block with respect to North America           North-seeking magnetic directions point eastward in coastal Oregon rocks, indicating clockwise rotation. ( Tick marks show direction; pie shaped wedges show uncertainty. Gromme et al, 1986; Wells and Simpson, 2000)    70° rotation since 60 million years ago; 18° in last 15 m.y. have affected coastal Oregon. In Washington, the small coastal blocks have rotated less.                                      Cascadia's coastal blocks move northward                              Tectonic model for long-term motion of Cascadia coastal blocks:       If we link clockwise rotation of the Oregon coastal  block (OC, pink) to NW motion of the Sierra Nevada block (purple) by a ""hinge"" in Klamath Mountains (KM), we can predict the long-term velocity of coastal blocks (yellow arrows) with respect to stable North America.       Cascade volcanic arc (orange) erupts along trailing edge of Oregon block in region of crustal extension(compare the greater abundance of volcanism south of Mt. Rainier (MR) to lesser volume in the north, where block motion compresses the volcanic arc).    Northward motion of Oregon block squeezes western Washington (green) against Canadian Coast Mountains restraining bend, causing N-S compression, uplift, thrust faulting, and earthquakes.                    Global Positioning System measures present day velocity of coastal blocks                       Using satellite receivers (GPS), the present motions of coastal blocks with respect to stable North America can be measured (e.g., Thatcher et al, 1999; Savage et al., 2000; Khazeradze et al., 1999; McCaffrey et al., 2000).   The Sierra Nevada of California is moving northwest, and coastal Oregon north with respect to North America at 10-12 mm/yr (about 1/2 in/yr).   Part of the motion can be explained by the long-term tectonic model, above. In coastal OR and WA there is an additional eastward motion due to build up of elastic strain above the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.   The eastward motion will probably be released in future great subduction earthquakes, but the northward component is likely to be accommodated by faulting and earthquakes in the upper plate.                     What happens in Puget Sound?                              Some of the earthquakes and faults in Puget Sound are caused by the northward migration of coastal blocks       East-west faults (white lines) are mostly thrust faults that absorb N-S compression and crustal shortening as the region is squeezed against the Canadian Coast Mountains buttress by northward-moving coastal blocks.    The Seattle fault (1), the Kingston arch (2), and the Devils Mountain fault (3) are east-west fault zones that have a component of N-S thrust motion and related earthquakes (red dots) in Puget Sound.                   Intensive study of the Seattle fault and other crustal faults is underway to understand their contribution to the earthquake hazard                On Bainbridge Island, a strand of the Seattle fault actually reaches the surface, where trenching confirms the strand is an active thrust fault, dipping to the north.   Work is underway to determine the size and frequency of earthquakes on this and other faults in the Puget lowland.                                     Related Pacific Northwest Urban Corridor Geologic Mapping Project publications                  The information provided on this page was originally presented as a poster at the Great Cascadia Earthquake Tricentennial Open House, January 26, 2000, Burke Museum, University of Washington,  Seattle WA   Authors: 1) U.S. Geological Survey, 345 Middlefield Rd.

The researchers combined satellite radar images                and Global Position System (GPS) observations to measure more accurately                than ever before the tectonic squeezing of the region that is responsible                for earthquakes like the 1987 M=6 Whittier Narrows and M=6.7 Northridge                shocks. In the process, they discovered that large regions of metropolitan                Los Angeles are rising and falling by up to 11 cm (4.3 in) every                year with a large portion of the city of Santa Ana sinking at a                rate of 12 mm (0.5 in) per year.                                                                                                                           Satellite radar                      interferogram draped over the topography of metropolitan Los                      Angeles, California. The repeating color bands of the large                      oval show about two inches (54 mm) of subsidence throughout                      the basin between May and September, 1999 (175 days). The                      Newport-Inglewood fault is the straight line located just                      inside the coast line. The small isolated 'bull's eye' feature                      North of Palos Verdes and East of downtown LA is from pumping                      activity in the Inglewood oilfield.

The satellite radar images show that the 40-km (25mi) long Santa                Ana basin (which includes the cites of Santa Ana, Anaheim, Garden                Grove, Norwalk, Downey, Lakewood, and Fountain Valley) rises every                winter and then drops during the summer. This ‘breathing’                of the earth’s surface is not caused by the tectonic forces                that squeeze the Los Angeles basin, rather it is caused by the widespread                pumping and recharge of groundwater, the basin reacting like a giant                sponge that is annually drenched and drained. The magnitude and                extent of these seasonal motions are a product of Los Angeles’                great thirst for water; they are unprecedented, and have not been                observed elsewhere in the world.

Schematic block                      diagram showing the association of GPS site motions with blind                      thrust faults in metropolitan Los Angeles. The blind thrust                      faults are in bold orange lines and other active faults are                      thin orange lines. Large earthquakes are shown as orange stars                      with the date and magnitude. The large white arrows show the                      direction of shortening across Los Angeles with the expected                      motion from the strike-slip faults removed. The size of those                      arrows does not relate to any particular scale.

Since the risks for earthquakes in Los Angeles are greater than                any other city in the United States, determining which faults are                moving and how they move is an essential step in assessing earthquake                hazards. After the Whittier Narrows and Northridge earthquakes revealed                that blind thrust faults threaten metropolitan Los Angeles, an array                of 250 continuously recording GPS stations (SCIGN) was deployed                to detect and monitor the motion associated with the movement of                the blind thrust(inclined faults that do not reach the surface)                and the surface faults. Gerald Bawden and his colleagues analyzed                data from this network and found that groundwater, oil, and natural                gas pumping produce motions at some of the GPS sites that obscure                and in some cases mimic the tectonic signals expected from the blind                thrust faults. The satellite radar imagery allows them to discriminate                sites that contain only the tectonic signal from those that have                a combination of tectonic and human-induce motions. By utilizing                only the GPS sites that contain tectonic signal, they determined                that the tectonic squeezing (4.4±0.8 mm/yr: 0.17±0.03                in/yr) across Los Angeles will likely produce earthquakes on the                either the blind Elysian Park or Puente Hills thrust faults systems.                The seasonal rising and falling of the Los Angeles area is caused                by the increasing demand for water throughout the region. To meet                the growing need for water during the hot summer months, water districts                in southern California pump water into the ground throughout the                year, and then when the demand for water is highest (between May                and September), water is pumped out of these large underground ‘reservoirs’.                The repeating pattern of pumping and recharge produces the seasonal                motion that is evident in the satellite imagery and GPS observations.                Repeatedly lowering the water table each summer to new lower levels                is causing the Santa Ana basin to sink, with about 84 mm (3.3 in)                of subsidence near Santa Ana between 1993 and 1999.                                                                                                                          GPS site motion                      across Los Angeles that is produced by tectonic contraction.                      Here we highlighted the motion that is not associated with                      the surface faults. This displacement (black arrows) show                      that tectonic forces are squeezing the Los Angeles basin.                      And indeed, this squeezing is likely accommodated by the thrust                      faults hidden beneath the metropolitan area.                         The red regions                      delimit areas where the ground has sunk over the years. The                      blue patches point to where the ground rose. This intriguing                      pattern is due to human activity: the pumping and injection                      of ground water and oil extraction.                      The dotted lines                      are the surface projections of the Elysian Park and Compton                      thrust faults.

Clicking on a station code will take you to a plot of the north, east and up components  of the station as a function of time.    The station velocities are in an itrf97-NA-fixed reference frame. The reference frame is described more fully under the Summary Info button on each station page. See  gp processing . for more information about the processing. Please read disclaimer below.      Disclaimer:       Be advised that these results are preliminary.  The station positions are unchecked and should not be used for any engineering applications. There may be errors in the antenna heights.  The velocities are very dependent on the length of the span of observations. The presence of outliers (errant observations) sometimes contaminates the velocities.   Caveat emptor.

   Wayne Thatcher                      My research applies space geodetic measurements of Earth's                      surface movements around active faults and volcanoes to understand                      the processes that lead to earthquakes and eruptions. Satellite                      geodesy is revolutionizing our ability to map surface movements                      in space and time.                      Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements permit us to                      make point measurements at critical locations, either using                      periodic surveys or continuously at permanent sites.                      Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques                      provide complete spatial mappings of deformation over time                      intervals of months or years.                      Our group is actively applying these methods to view how                      the interior western U. S. is deforming and to image the patterns                      of ground movements around volcanoes, both when eruptions                      appear imminent and when volcanoes are apparently quiescent.                      Using the observed movements, we construct models of the sources                      of deformation. We integrate geodetic data and models with                      results from active process geology, geomorphology, seismology                      and geophysics to better understand the physics of earthquake                      faulting and volcanism.

Based on the historic record and other                evidence, the U.S. Geological Survey had predicted that a ""Parkfield""                earthquake would occur before the end of 1993. Although the expected                earthquake has yet to occur, Parkfield remains a likely site in                California for a moderate earthquake and is densely instrumented                in anticipation of that event. The goal is to study the complete                earthquake cycle using many instruments to record the deformation                prior, during, and after this earthquake. These observations will                guide both theoretical and laboratory studies on the causes of earthquakes.

They can detect changes of about 0.1 millimeters.                                       •  Dilational Strainmeters                   These instruments measure the volumetric stretching and squeezing                    of the ground near active faults. Over short time periods they                    can detect changes of 1-part-per-billion (1 inch in 16,000 miles).                                                         •  Magnetometers                   Magnetometers measure absolute magnetic field to a precision                    of 0.2 nanoTesla. Differences between adjacent sites are computed                    to isolate local magnetic fields.                                        •  Tensor                    Strainmeters                   These instruments measure the directional stretching and squeezing                    in the ground near active faults. Over short time periods they                    can detect changes of 1-part-per-billion (1 inch in 16,000 miles).                                       •  Water Level Monitors                   Water Level Monitors measure changes in the height of the                    ground water table within borehole wells. These instruments                    can detect changes of a few millimeters over short time periods.                                       •  Tiltmeters                   Tiltmeters continuously monitor rotation or tilting in the                    ground near active faults by precisely measuring either the                    movement of a pendulum or fluid levels in connected reservoirs                    (rather like the ring in a bathtub) as the ground tilts. Measurements                    can easily be made to better than 1 part per billion.                                       •  Geodesy                   The location of many land survey markers located in active                    fault zones in the United States are measured using Global Positioning                    System (GPS) receivers. These receivers are a high precision                    version of the small handheld receivers available today in electronics                    stores.The high precision version together with appropriate                    computer processing is capable of measuring the horizontal position                    of sites with an accuracy of a few millimeters (mm), and the                    vertical position with an accuracy of about 10 mm. Using GPS,                    relative motion of sites a few hundred kilometers apart can                    be determined to a precision of 1 part per 10 million, and relative                    motion of sites on opposite ends of the continent to a precision                    of 1 part per billion. The U.S. Naval Observatory maintains                    a site containing  general                    information on the GPS system .                                       •  Two                    Color EDM                   The two-color EDM (Electronic Distance Meter) is an ultra-precise                    distance measuring instrument with a precision of 0.5 to 1.0                    mm for ranges between 1 and 12 km. This instrument is used to                    measure crustal deformation along faults and near volcanoes.                    Currently, we use this instrument to monitor the deformation                    of the Long Valley Caldera east of Yosemite, and at Parkfield,                    California along the San Andreas fault. To take advantage of                    the instrument's high precision, these measurements are made                    frequently, typically several times each week. In addition,                    we make infrequent measurements of distances at other sites                    in California to measure strain accumulation within the San                    Andreas fault zone.

SCEC is a National Science Foundation       (NSF) Science and Technology       Center and is co-funded by the United States Geological Survey      USGS.          The Southern California Earthquake Center's mission is to promote earthquake hazard reduction by:                               Defining when and where future damaging earthquakes will               occur in Southern California                Calculating the expected ground motions                Communicating this information to the public                       The Center's goal is to develop       a ""Master Model"" of seismic hazard in Southern California by integrating various       earth science data through probabilistic seismic hazard analysis.    A database of publised papers based on SCEC funded research is available, as well as several data sets, briefly summarized below:     SCEC Data Center: Seismic data sets, recent       earthquake lists and maps, basic earthquake science facts,       ""SeismoCam"" (live and recorded seismograms) and links       to other data centers.      Strong Motion Database:       A relational database providing information about and access       to strong ground motion recordings. The database currently contains       over 5,000 accelerograms from 119 California earthquakes. The       amount of data in the database is still growing and the database       is fully Web-accessible.         Empirical Green's Functions Library:       A relational database and data repository containing 84,641       seismograms from 1500 southern California earthquakes. The purpose       of this site is to provide fast and easy access to recordings       of small earthquakes that might be used as Green's functions       for predicting the ground motion from larger earthquakes.          Southern California Integerated GPS Network (SCIGN):       An array of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations       distributed throughout southern California with emphasis on the       greater Los Angeles metropolitan region.         Campaign-Mode GPS Data at the SCEC Data Center:       The SCEC Data Center archive of GPS data contains data from ""survey-mode""       precise GPS measurements made in Southern California by various       universities, Federal organizations (notably the US Geological       Survey and the National Geodetic Survey), the California Department       of Transportation, and Southern California counties, cities,       and water districts.         Crustal Deformation Velocity Map:  The velocity map represents the first attempt       by the Crustal       Deformation Working Group of the Southern California Earthquake       Center to produce a unified horizontal velocity field showing       contemporary interseismic deformation in southern California.         ROSRINE Project: Resolution of Site Response Issues from the Northridge Earthquake:       A variety of site response data from L.A. area sites are available,       such as P and S-wave velocities using the suspension logging       method.

GX008-92-4578079	Greg Anderson's Homepage           Greg Anderson           Mendenhall Postdoctoral Fellow    US Geological Survey  525 South Wilson Avenue  Pasadena CA 91106    Phone: (626) 583-6799       FAX: (626) 583-7827         E-mail:  ganderson@usgs.gov      My primary research interest is understanding the processes which govern the behavior of active fault systems through space and time.   I use GPS geodetic methods and seismology to learn more about these processes.   GPS gives us the ability to measure very small changes in the positions of points on Earth's surface.   These changes may reflect slow background tectonics, the effects of large regional earthquakes (both immediately and for a time after the event), and human-induced causes such as groundwater extraction.  I use GPS data from the   Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN)  to model the deformation of Earth's surface in terms of fault slip and earthquake potential.   One of the most exciting ideas in geoscience in recent years is the concept that faults interact with each other, and earthquakes trigger one another, through stress and pore-fluid pressure changes generated by large earthquakes. Several stress transfer models have been proposed, and some are beginning to be included in seismic hazard estimates, but the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, and more work remains. This part of my research concentrates on statistical testing of stress transfer models and applying them to understand earthquake stress triggering, which will help in improving the usefulness of stress transfer models.

What is GPS?                GPS stands for Global Positioning System. The Global Positioning                System is a group of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth twice a day                at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometers (That's about 12,000 miles).                  GPS was designed by the military to locate tanks, planes, and                  ships. The system has been adopted by the public for many navigation                  and scientific applications. With the proper equipment you can                  find your latitude, longitude, and elevation at any time and at                  any place on Earth. This means no matter where you go, you can                  never get lost.                                                                   How does it work?                GPS satellites continuously broadcast messages on 2 radio frequencies.                These messages contain a very accurate time signal, a rough estimate                of the satellite's position in space, and a set of coded information                that a GPS receiver can decipher.                  We want to know our latitude, longitude, and elevation. The                  receiver uses its internal clock and the coded information from                  each GPS satellite to determine the time it took the signals to                  reach the receiver. Since the signals travel at the speed of light,                  the receiver can calculate the distance to each satellite.                  Once the receiver knows the distances to at least 4 satellites,                  and their positions, it can determine its clock correction and                  position on the Earth.How does it work?                                    How do pilots, boaters, and hikers use GPS?                All you need is a clear view of the sky (this could be a problem                in the woods or city), and a GPS receiver. Simply turn on the receiver                and within minutes the receiver calculates your position.                  Even in the worst weather conditions you can know your location                  to within 100 meters (about 300 feet). That accuracy is fine for                  most navigation purposes. But since the motion across faults,                  such as the San Andreas, is usually less than 5 centimeters (2                  inches) per year, the USGS has to use special techniques to get                  much better accuracy.                                                                   How does the USGS use GPS to measure fault motion?                We want to know how stations near active faults move relative to                each other. When we occupy several stations at the same time, and                all stations observe the same satellites, the relative positions                of all the stations can be determined very precisely. Often we are                able to determine the distances between stations, even over distances                up to several 100 miles, to better than 5 millimeters (about a 1/4                of an inch).                                     Months or years later we occupy the same stations again. By                  determining how the stations have moved we calculate how much                  strain is accumulating and which faults are slipping.                                                                   Where do we work?                The USGS uses GPS to measure crustal deformation all over the United              States. However most of the work is concentrated in the western states              where most earthquakes occur and where rates of crustal deformation              are high. The processing pages contain maps with station locations.              Two location maps can be reached from the  GPS              Home Page  and from these, you can reach maps for individual ""campaigns""              or sets of stations.

GX004-86-15482153	USGS WWW Pages:  National  |   Pasadena  |   Western Region               The Northridge Earthquake    The Northridge earthquake inflicted most damage by shaking  the ground. It also permanently deformed the ground surface - that is, after the shaking stopped, the ground surface had been uplifted in places. A   dome-shaped pattern of uplift  formed, with points near the top of the dome uplifted by about 50 centimeters (20 inches). This permanent ground deformation also wreaked costly damage on the urban infrastructure, though this damage was more subtle and less severe than the shaking- induced damage.   We measured the permanent ground deformation using   GPS and leveling surveys . We compared the measurements made before and after the earthquake to find the amount of horizontal and vertical shift of the ground surface at each of the survey points. Then, we calculated where and how much slip happened on the fault during the earthquake    ( Hudnut et al. , 1996) .  Measurements of the deformation also allowed us to estimate  the overall pattern of permanent uplift and horizontal motion produced by the earthquake. From this, we were able to estimate   tilt  of the ground surface, and how that may   affect water systems  such as aqueducts and other water system infrastructure.

Prescott E-Mail:wprescott@isdmnl.wr.usgs.gov       U.S. Geological Survey Voice: 1-415-329-4860       345 Middlefield Road, MS/977 Fax: 1-415-329-5163       Menlo Park, CA 94025-3591           GPS provides information for earthquake loss reduction     The outer layer of the earth is composed of a dozen or so large pieces called tectonic plates. Most earthquakes result from distortion that occurs near the edges of these plates as they try to move past one another. The Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites provide precise measurements of this movement and distortion and, thus, provide very direct information about what happens during earthquakes and very directly feed estimates of the probability of future earthquakes.      Role of GPS in monitoring Deformation     GPS finds application in earthquake hazard reduction work because it gives a very precise measurement of a station location. Depending upon the way the signals from the GPS satellites are used, the resulting uncertainty in the site location can be as large as 100 m., or as small as 2 mm. In the simplest, and least accurate, application of GPS, a single receiver uses the distances to the satellites to determine the receiver's position, giving a position with about 100 meter uncertainty. This is called GPS Navigation. A more precise measurement can be made by parking one receiver at a known location, and monitoring the errors in the distances to the satellites. These errors can then be used to correct the distances measured at nearby receivers at unknown locations. This produces positions with an accuracy of 1 or 2 m., and is called Differential GPS. The most precision is obtained when satellite signals from two receivers are combined. Phase information in the signals can be used to determine the position difference between the sites with an accuracy of a few millimeters in the horizontal and a centimeter in the vertical. This Interferometric GPS is the only technique with sufficient accuracy to measure the small motions produced by earthquakes and all of the remainder of this discussion will refer Interferometric GPS.   Until about 1992, all of the GPS measurements used for earthquake hazard reduction work came from GPS receivers that were operated in ""Campaign"" mode. The receivers are placed at a site for a few hours or days then moved elsewhere.    NEHRP supports campaign-mode GPS surveys both inside the USGS and in the NEHRP external grant program. Current areas monitored with campaign-mode GPS include the Pacific Northwest, the San Francisco bay area, the Los Angeles metropolitan area and many other active faults in the western U.S. NEHRP supports some GPS campaign work in Alaska in a cooperative project with NASA. Some of the GPS funded by the NEHRP external grants program is done in cooperation with an NSF-funded consortium of GPS researchers called UNAVCO (University Navstar Consortium).   In the past few years, many sites have been instrumented with permanent GPS receivers. These ""Continuous"" GPS sites are almost always equipped with telemetry that brings the data back to some central location for rapid processing. There are a growing number of arrays of continuous GPS stations. Those of most relevance to NEHRP are discussed here.      BARD --The USGS and the University of California, Berkeley jointly operate the Bay Area Regional Deformation network, an array of 18 continuous GPS stations in northern California. BARD provides an accurate velocity field from which to understand earthquake potential in this part of California.    SCIGN --The Southern California Integrated GPS Network is a joint effort of the USGS, NASA/JPL, and the University of California, San Diego. SCIGN currently consists of about 40 GPS stations distributed throughout the greater Los Angeles metropolitan region. NEHRP/USGS, NSF, NASA, and the Keck Foundation have funded an expansion of the array to 250 stations. To achieve high precision, the sites are carefully monumented and all the GPS receivers operate continuously. The goals of the array are to provide an accurate and detailed velocity field from which to identify the deformation from known faults, test current models of the geologic structure, and make better estimates of the seismic potential in the populous parts of southern California.    IGS --The International GPS Service is an international cooperative effort that collects data from about 200 stations worldwide and provides precise positions and satellite orbits that are needed for the highest precision local surveys.     PANGA --The USGS, the Canadian Geodetic Survey, Central Washington University, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and the University of Washington, operate this Pacific Northwest Geodetic Array  of 40 or more continuous stations to monitor earthquake hazard and study continental geodynaimcs in this area.    CORS --The U.S. Coast Guard, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Aviation Administration and others are building a nation-wide network of GPS receivers Currently, the Continuously Operating Reference Station network has 82 sites distributed fairly uniformly throughout the United States. This array is not designed for earthquake mitigation; rather, it is aimed at navigation and surveying users. However, the receivers are high quality and the data are available for other users. The network is a valuable source of data for reconnaissance earthquake studies on a national scale.    Japan --The largest such array in the world today is located in Japan where about 1000 instruments have been installed throughout the country.          Other applications of GPS in earthquake mitigation     GPS is currently being used to monitor some structures. As part of the USGS continuous GPS operations in Southern California, Pacoima Dam is being monitored through a joint pilot study in collaboration with Los Angeles County and other researchers within the Southern California Integrated GPS Network (SCIGN). The project was begun in order to demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring dams and other engineered structures (such as freeway overpasses and high-rise buildings) using continuous GPS technology and infrastructure. This dam is a 120 meter tall concrete arch that was constructed in the late 1920's. Pacoima dam withstood, but was damaged by, very strong ground shaking in both the 1971 and 1994 earthquakes. Due to concern about the stability of this dam in response to potential earthquakes in the future, the County purchased GPS equipment, and with assistance from the USGS in Pasadena, they began monitoring the dam using continuous GPS on September 1, 1995.   In the future other structures may be monitored with GPS. GPS provides the absolute motion of the structure in ways that are not easily achieved with other techniques. There is discussion about monitoring the deformation of building during earthquakes with GPS instruments installed at strategic locations on the building. The difference between the motion of a GPS receiver on the roof of a building and one at mid level, and one at ground level can supplement the strong motion recorders that seismologists have used in the past to understand how to increase the building's resistance to earthquakes.   This discussion has focused on the role of high-precision GPS measurements in NEHRP. GPS is also used as a positioning system for many other NEHRP sponsored activities, such as geologic and topographic map making and locating seismic instruments.

GX004-25-12857892	"New Technology to Help Measurement and Study of Earthquakes      Media contact:  Cheryl Dybas  (703) 306-1070  NSF 96-67  October 30, 1996    All others contact:  Jim Whitcomb  (703) 306-1556   Scientists have begun installing a network of 250 Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that will continuously measure the constant, yet physically imperceptible, movements of earthquake faults throughout southern California.  This information should help researchers forecast future earthquake hazards in the greater Los Angeles area.   ""GPS is the most important new technology to emerge for the study of earthquakes in decades,"" says Tom Henyey, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) in Los Angeles, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center.  ""This information will allow us to improve our estimates of the regional earthquake hazard in southern California and to prioritize earthquake mitigation activities, including emergency preparedness and retrofit strategies. Continuous GPS measurements will also allow for more rapid regional damage assessment after large earthquakes.""   GPS is a constellation of 24 Earth-orbiting satellites, arranged so that several are ""visible"" from any point on the surface of the Earth at any time.  A user on the ground with a GPS receiver can determine his or her precise location by measuring signals from the GPS satellites.   The continuous, earthquake-related measurements from the GPS network will allow scientists to make a high-precision survey of the southern California terrain.  Information from the network of receivers will be used to create maps of strain accumulation along fault lines that will enable scientists to evaluate future probabilities of regional earthquake hazards, and develop earthquake scenarios for specific faults.   Currently, the network has 40 GPS receivers up and running, with the remaining 210 receivers scheduled to be installed over the next three years.  The receivers are placed about six miles (10 kilometers) apart, usually in open fields.  With data from the 40 receivers, scientists have determined that the Earth has continued to move, mostly in quiet and without us feeling it, since the Northridge quake in 1994.  ""The survey data are particularly important for identifying active buried faults that do not reach the ground surface.  Such faults may be common in the Los Angeles metropolitan region,"" says David Jackson, science director of SCEC.   The GPS measurements will also be useful during and after earthquakes.  Scientists can measure ground motions from earthquakes, and identify the fault that ruptured and help evaluate regional deformation and stress changes in near-real-time with an automated system.  The network will also help in monitoring important structures.  GPS receivers placed on or near dams, bridges, and buildings will allow off-site detection of probable damage to those structures.   Many of the receivers are being placed at schools so that students can be involved in the experiment.  SCEC's ""Global Science Classroom"" at the University of Southern California has formed a partnership with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, several school districts, and educators' groups to develop a science unit for use in schools.  ""The Elastic Planet"" will give students access to the data being gathered by the network.

GX003-99-6397205	"Crustal Deformation in Southcentral Alaska    Since the early 1990's I have been studying crustal deformation in southcentral Alaska (figure 1), a region that was severely affected by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake. This earthquake had an estimated moment magnitude of 9.2 and is the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake to occur in North America.  Horizontal displacements of up to 25 m or more and vertical displacements of several meters occurred as a portion of the Pacific Plate slid in a north-northwesterly direction under the North America Plate. The region of significant coseismic crustal deformation extended northeast from Kodiak Island to well beyond Prince William Sound, a region about 500-600 km in length and 200-300 km in width. Our investigations of the crustal deformation in this region have several components. The field investigations consist of Global Positioning System (GPS) observations of the ongoing three dimensional crustal motion (figure 2, figure 3). We also analyze apparent sea level height observations from tide gauge stations (figure 4) and have reanalyzed historic leveling data . We have developed numerical models that provide an explanation of our observations and insight into the subsurface processes responsible for them. This research began as a collaborative effort with Sanford Holdahl, now retired from the National Geodetic Survey. More recently, Jeffrey Freymueller and his colleagues at the Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks have taken the lead role in producing and analyzing the GPS results.      Figure1: Map of southcentral Alaska     ==============================================================      Figure 2: Cumulative crustal uplift between 1964 and 1995 relative to a site in Seward. Notice the nearly 1 m uplift in the center of the Kenai Peninsula and the general SE-NW trend of the uplift pattern.. The uplift is computed by comparing relative height profiles from a 1964 leveling survey and contemporary GPS observations using a high precision local relative geoid height model to transform between the orthometric (leveling) and geometric (GPS) coordinate systems. From Cohen and Freymueller, 1997.      ===============================================================    Figure 3: Contemporary horizontal velocities from GPS observations. The North-northwest motion of sites on the eastern half of the figure is attributable to elastic strain accumulation along the Pacific-North America tectonic plate interface. The southeasterly directed motions on the west side of the figure are more enigmatic but may be due to long term (or delayed) deep postseismic fault slip. The shallow portion of the plate boundary up-dip of the southeasterly moving sites probably exhibits weak coupling, hence no shallow elastic strain accumulation.  From Freymueller, Cohen, and Fletcher, 2000.     ==============================================================      Figure 4 Uplift rates versus time. The results are normalized by the amount of coseismic slip (in meters). The data types include: tide gauge data - crosses, maxima from leveling surveys and GPS-leveling comparisons - circles, Very Long Baseline Interferometery -asterisk, Specific locales are indicated as follows: AB - Anchorage, KI - Kodiak Island, NI - Nikiski, SL-Seldovia, and SW - Seward, General area are TN - Turnagain Arm and KP - Kenai Peninsula. The dashed curved follows Omori's Law, B/(1 + t/T) with t equal to the time since the earthquake and B=7 cm/yr, T=3 yrs. The dotted curve is an exponential, Aexp(-t/r) with A = 8 cm/yr and r = 6 years. Recent evidence suggests that there may be additional long term component to the deformation not modeled by the simple behavior shown here.
