GX031-20-2349481	Pima County Department of Transportation   Technical Services Division - GIS Database Services   Developing GIS for the Web   Methods for Publishing Spatial Data on the Internet   Map Generators       Map generation process:    Map generators use a browser form.  The user to enters specifications such as location, thematic layers and symbology on the form.  The form is passed to the web server. A gateway at the web server passes the request to a GIS server. For instance, the gateway could pass the request in the form of AML to  an ARC/INFO server. The ARC/INFO server generates a graphics file which is converted to GIF image.  The GIF image is sent back to the client and viewed using native browser capability.     The advantage of map generators is creating custom maps on the fly. Disadvantages include lack of access to the raw spatial data, typically slower, limited predefined user choices, and involved setup. ARC/INFO is not designed for this medium.    Commercial, off-the-shelf solutions for GIS - WWW interfacing  is a list of solutions that might fit into this category.  GRID-Arendal Data and Information sources  shows some of the source's work at the same web site.   Some of the following examples may access large enough databases or respond fast enough to put them in the next category of  real time map browsers  rather than map generators.  Examples of map generators:    The  U.S. Census Bureau 's  Tiger Mapping Service  lets you build a map for any location in the US. You can even  Request TMS maps directly  from your own HTML web pages or CGI script. Use their service to build custom maps for your users on the fly. For instance:  http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapbrowse-tbl?&lon=-110.9&lat=32.2  generates up a browsable, customizable map of the Tucson area.  University of Virginia  SocialSciences Data Server .  BADGER  gives access to San Francisco Bay Area geo-data over the Internet, including vector data superimposed over scalable aerial images.  The following all appear to be based on technology from  Geosystems Global Corporation  with data from  Etak, Inc.     The  Lycos  search site offers   Road Map  which builds customized maps from addresses.  Maps On Us  finds routes and displays maps with route instructions. Cool!  Bigbook  can find businesses and display a map given any address.    MapQuest  is an amazing interactive map and search facility.  Yahoo Maps  is another, similar, map generator.  Netday96  allows you to zoom in on a pin map of participating schools until a text  file describing participation at the school is displayed.    The West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection  has a GIS page with both a West Virginia GIS Data Repository and a WWW On-Line Interactive GIS Service.  GIS-based Air Pollution Modeling on the WWW  is a demonstration of a smokestack air pollution model.  It accepts your input for smokestack parameters and generates contour map of concentrations by linking the web to ARC/INFO to do the analysis.  The  University of Adelaide  in Austrailia has another interactive web interface to ARC/INFO, the  Ecotourism Interactive GIS . You can select features to draw (zoom, pan etc), interrogate park and vegetation data (writes to a report window), connect from drawn map features to hypermedia information (via WWW hot links strategy), and produce an image file.  Xerox PARC MapWeb Server   The  Verde River Watershed  in Arizona offers   Make O' Map .  ForNet MapServer Software  is a freely  available system for generating and displaying maps interactively on the web.

GX042-58-0401531	"Pima County Department of Transportation   Technical Services Division - GIS Database Services   Developing GIS data for the Web   Viewing AutoCAD drawings     Raster Image Formats    GIF files allow any web browser to view the image easily, but without pan and zoom capability. As with ARC/INFO, a screen capture program can be used to grab images  from the screen while running AutoCAD and then save it as a GIF file. We haven't done this.  We have tried to convert DXF files to GIF files with programs such as HiJaak and CorelDRAW. In each case there have been problems with the result.   Release 13 of AutoCAD includes a new SAVEIMG command that allows saving drawings as GIF (and other formats) directly. This works well.  City Limits Maps  is an example of GIF files created with this technique. Images appear identical to the original AutoCAD images when viewed with Netscape. Of course, the GIF files aren't scalable, but at the same scale, the results are identical.    Vector Image Formats    There are at least two vector choices,  DWG  and  DWF  files. Vector formats have the big advantage of allowing panning and zooming. GIFs are like toys in comparison.   Viewing and Publishing DWF Files    DWF (Design Web Format) is a file format proposed as a standard by  Autodesk  for making AutoCAD drawings available on the web.  DWF files are optimized  for web viewing. They are smaller than DWG files, can contain URL links, and allow you to distribute an image while keeping your DWG files proprietary, if you wish.    See  Viewing AutoCAD DWF Images  for DWF viewing options. See Autodesk's   Publishing DWFs  and  Serving AutoCAD DWF Images  for publishing DWF's.  Pima County's  Technical Services Landbase Maps   were generated with these Autodesk tools. They also demonstrate URLs embedded in the DWFs and integration with a tabular database. Since the Release 13 Internet Publishing Kit, AutoCAD has been able to create DWFs with the DWFOUT command.     CADViewer  offers a way you can serve DWF files without requiring a plug-in. CADViewer uses a 100% Java applet rather than a plug-in, enabling viewing on any Java-enabled platform without any special user action.   Viewing and Publishing DWG Files      See  Viewing AutoCAD DWG Files      If your web server software supports the generation of automatic directory  listings, you can publish your DWG or DWF library just by pointing to it's root directory.  You may choose to keep both DWG and DWF formats in the same directories.   To serve DWG files, it is usually necessary to configure your web server for the correct MIME type for DWG files. Otherwise, browser plug-ins won't recognize the drawing files. For instance, for Internet Information Server version 4, right-click on the server name to get its properties. Then set the ""Associated Extension"" to      .dwg   and set the ""Content Type (MIME)"" to      image/vnd.dwg     For Internet Information Server versions 2 and 3, you need to edit the registry. Other web servers have different procedures for setting MIME types.    Here's the complete list of MIME types   recommended by Autodesk  for their files:      .dwg   image/vnd.dwg     .dxf   image/vnd.dxf     .dwf   drawing/x-dwf      Other DWG MIME types of image/x-dwg and drawing/x-dwg are in use by some web servers, but they don't appear to be the currently official  registered DWG types."

GX000-03-6103403	Information Dissemination                                       On October 1, 2002, the Department of Transportation (DOT) issued agency  guidelines  to ensure the quality of disseminated information.   If you are affected by information that the Department has disseminated on or after October 1, 2002 (i.e., if you are harmed because the information does not meet the standards of the guidelines or a correction of the information would benefit you), you may request that the Department correct that information.   We regard information originally disseminated before October 1, 2002, as being subject to this correction process only if it remains readily available to the public (e.g., it is posted on a DOT website) and it continues to play a significant, active role in Department programs or in private sector decisions.     The Department will consider only fully-completed  requests for correction  or  requests for reconsideration  via the Department's on-line request forms. Although we prefer a completed on-line form, we will also respond to request in written form, by letter or fax, to the following address:       U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT)    Office of Dockets and Media Management    SUBJECT:  Request for Correction of Information      Room PL-401    400 7th Street, S.W.,     Washington, DC  20590    Fax number: 202/366-7202            Note: If you are making a request for reconsideration, you should include a reference to the initially assigned DOT docket number.   This will enable DMS personnel to correctly place your reconsideration request in the same docket as your initial request.
