This is a  list of characters  from  InuYasha , the  manga  and  anime  series by  Rumiko Takahashi .   The characters can be split into several groups. The group of protagonists, headed by InuYasha and Kagome, is the main acting unit in the series. It takes place in vast majority of events and conveys the story's main plot: the collection of Shikon Jewel Shards and the gradual transformation of the characters through love, affection and numerous trials they come through together. Naraku's group unites the main antagonists and is the ""ultimate enemy"" to be defeated. Other groups and characters play various roles including a few subplots of different significance.

[ edit ]   InuYasha       Main article:  InuYasha (character)       InuYasha  (  ? )  is the  protagonist  of the  manga  and  anime . InuYasha is a half-demon, born to a dog demon father and human mother. InuYasha was sealed to the sacred tree 500 years before the start of the series by the  priestess   Kikyo , and released by  Kagome  who turns out to be Kikyo's reincarnation. [ 1 ]  InuYasha desires the  Shikon Jewel  so he may become a full demon. He often clashes with his older half-brother,  Sesshomaru , who desires his sword the Tetsusaiga, a supernatural sword made from one of their deceased father's fangs. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kappei Yamaguchi . [ 2 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Richard Ian Cox . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Kagome Higurashi       Main article:  Kagome Higurashi       Kagome Higurashi  (   ,   Higurashi Kagome ? )  is the second protagonist of the series. She is the reincarnation of the priestess Kikyo, who died 500 years before the start of the series. [ 1 ]  Kagome was pulled into the Bone Eater's Well by a demon who wanted the Shikon Jewel, which was hidden in her body, sending her back to the  Feudal Era . [ 1 ] [ 4 ]  Kagome takes over Kikyo's task of protecting the Shikon Jewel, but accidentally shatters it with her arrow. Due to the fact that she is the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome possesses great spiritual power and is able to purify tainted shards of the jewel. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Satsuki Yukino . [ 5 ]  In the English dub, she is voiced by  Moneca Stori . [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Miroku   Miroku  (  ? )  is a  Buddhist monk  who traveled the countryside performing (mostly fictitious) services such as exorcisms and demon exterminations to earn his living. He suffers from a hereditary curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather Miyatsu by Naraku. [ 7 ]  The hole in his hand became a Wind Tunnel, which sucks in almost anything in its path. The Wind Tunnel proves to be a powerful weapon against demons, but grows larger as time passes. He joins InuYasha and Kagome in hopes that he will be able to find and kill Naraku so he may break the curse before it consumes him, like his grandfather and father. [ 7 ]  Miroku also uses his holy staff and several scrolls to attack enemies. Miroku first meets InuYasha after he steals the Shikon Jewel. InuYasha attacks Miroku and Miroku quickly uses his Wind Tunnel. Realizing he won't harm humans, Kagome stands in his path. Miroku quickly covers the Wind Tunnel, and after explaining his situation, InuYasha allows him to join their group. Miroku has habit of asking random women to bear his child so that, in the case that he would die defeating Naraku, he would have an heir. A running gag is Miroku's  lechery , specifically shameless flattery and occasional  groping  with varying subtlety. After his father had died, Miroku was raised by a monk named Mushin, and learned his lecherous tendencies from him. At the end of the series, Miroku gets married to Sango and they have three children,  twin  girls and a boy.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kji Tsujitani . [ 8 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Kirby Morrow . [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Sango   Sango  (  ? )  is a demon slayer who hails from a village of professional demon slayers. Sango wields the Hiraikotsu, a massive boomerang made of purified demon bones, along with a broad repertoire of tools and tricks, which are used for fighting demons. Sango and the souls of the purified demons of Hiraikotsu share a deep connection, and when she puts the weapon in danger to save Miroku, they chide her for it and ask that she put themselves above him. She is constantly seen with her companion Kirara, a demon cat. Sango's family was killed and her entire village destroyed by Naraku's demons so Naraku could steal their Shikon Jewel shards. He then blames InuYasha and manipulates Sango into trying to kill him. When the ploy failed, Naraku uses a shard of the Shikon Jewel to revive and control Sango's little brother Kohaku, forcing him to fight InuYasha and company, and using him as a means by which to manipulate Sango. She seeks vengeance against Naraku, but her primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku's influence and save his life. Sango is often the victim of Miroku's lecherous tendencies, and proceeds to slap him for it. However, she later confesses her love to him and the two get engaged. At the end of the series, Sango and Miroku get married and the two have three children. She also allowed Kirara to join her brother Kohaku and aid him in his demon slaying.   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Hko Kuwashima . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Kelly Sheridan .     [ edit ]   Kirara   Kirara  (  ? )  is Sango's faithful,  demon-cat  companion. Kirara usually appears in the form of a small feline no larger than a kitten with two tails. When necessary, she can transform into full demon with larger saber-teeth, flames around her feet and tail, and at a size large enough to carry 2-3 humans on her back. In her full demon form, Kirara is capable of flying, an ability InuYasha's group find useful for transporting Sango, Miroku, and Shippo when InuYasha is running quickly or jumping to greater heights than they would normally be able to keep up with. For most of the series, Kirara stays primarily with Sango and aids InuYasha's group in battles. At the end of the series as Naraku has been defeated, she chooses to join Kohaku as he trains to become a demon slayer while Sango starts her new life with Miroku and their children.   In the anime series, it is suggested that she was once the companion of Midoriko, who originally created the  Shikon no Tama .   She is voiced by  Tarako  in both the original Japanese and the English dubbed version of the series.     [ edit ]   Shippo   Shippo  (  ,   Shipp ? )  is an orphaned young  fox demon  whose father was killed by the Thunder Brothers, Hiten and Manten, and the first character in the story to join InuYasha and Kagome in their travels as a group. After his father is killed by the Thunder Brothers, Shippo attempts to steal the Shikon Jewel from Kagome and InuYasha, with the intent to become stronger and avenge his father's death. Though his plans fails, Kagome and InuYasha aid him in fulfilling his revenge after hearing his story. Shippo appears as a young boy with fox legs, feet, ears, and a tail. He can also shape-shift into many different forms, but his forms are temporary, often incomplete and ineffective, and he is usually given away by his telltale tail. His other noteworthy abilities are turning into a large pink flying balloon, illusionary tricks with toys like his giant spinning top attack, weak fox fire magic, and making things multiply. He tends to be naively observant and often makes pointed and cheeky comments directed towards InuYasha, earning him a retaliatory bonk on the head. InuYasha and Kagome serve as older sibling figures to Shippo. Due to his size, Shippo is often seen riding on Kirara or the shoulders of others. His actual age is never stated in the series; according to the official  InuYasha  guide by Rumiko Takahashi, his appearance is intended to be similar to that of a seven year old boy.. [ 10 ]   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kumiko Watanabe . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Jillian Michaels .     [ edit ]   Myoga   Myoga  (  ,   Myga ? )  is a flea demon who appears randomly and gives InuYasha information on current events, foes, and the shards of the Jewel of Four Souls. He was originally charged with protecting the grave of InuYasha's father, where the Tetsusaiga was hidden. However, he fled when Sesshomaru came to the grave in search of the sword. Myoga also enjoys drinking demon blood, and actually saves InuYasha's life at one point by drinking the venom from a spider demon out of his blood. He often gets slapped by InuYasha and others because he drinks their blood without permission.   Myoga often flees before or during a battle, and the others have recognized as a sign of pending danger. Anywhere he is around is considered a safe area. In the anime series, he is engaged to another flea demon named Shoga, though he continually runs from her to avoid the marriage. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kenichi Ogata . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Paul Dobson .     [ edit ]   Sesshomaru's group     [ edit ]   Sesshomaru       Main article:  Sesshomaru       Sesshomaru  (  ,   Sesshmaru ? )  is InuYasha's older half-brother. Unlike InuYasha, Sesshomaru is a full-blooded Inu-yokai and is initially very contemptuous of InuYasha for being a half-demon and for consorting with humans. He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three of the manga, he could not defeat Naraku. Takahashi also stated that Sesshomaru has no permanent home, though he rules over the Western Lands. Unlike almost every other sentient demon in the world of InuYasha (aside from those affiliated with his and InuYasha's father in some way), he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel. Initially, Sesshomaru is ruthless and cruel in his pursuit of Tetsusaiga and his dealings with his brother. However, as the series progresses, he begins to undergo a change in his behavior, one largely brought about by the influence of Tenseiga and the human child  Rin . He stops trying to claim or destroy Tetsusaiga, and, while still sometimes hostile in his attitude toward InuYasha, he is sometimes ""helpful"" in his encounters with InuYasha's group. He, like InuYasha and his friends, becomes determined to destroy Naraku after Naraku attempts to manipulate him using Rin as a hostage, and his growing compassion for people such as Kagura and it finally prompts Ttsai to volunteer to reforge Tenseiga and make it able to perform the Meidou Zangetsuha (""dark path of the dawn's moon blast"") attack. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ken Narita . In the English dub, he is voiced by  David Kaye .     [ edit ]   Jaken   Jaken  (  ? )  is a small green  imp -like  ykai  who acts as Sesshomaru's servant. Jaken is not especially powerful but is extremely loyal. Despite his loyalty, Sesshomaru more often than not ignores him. However, Jaken continues to verbally promote the greatness of Sesshomaru in ways that the aristocratic Sesshomaru would never do himself. Sesshomaru once resurrected Jaken with the  Tenseiga  when he was killed by Kaijinbo who was possessed by  Tkijin . Jaken does not engage in battle much. When he does, it's usually a clash with a company of some other strong yokai, and he usually uses a weapon known as the Staff of Two Heads (,  nintj ). In the manga, little is explained about Jaken's past, but in the anime, it is explained that Jaken was once a lord among similar demons. A battle broke out with another ykai tribe. The leader of the larger tribe had Jaken by his neck, when Sesshomaru appeared and told the demon to move for he was blocking Sesshomaru's path. The ykai did not heed him and as soon as Sesshomaru repeated himself he used his poison whip and destroyed the ykai. Jaken, captivated by Sesshomaru's power, felt a need to repay him, and followed him. Sesshomaru told Jaken that if he could use the Staff of Two Heads, then he could become his servant. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Yuichi Nagashima . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Don Brown .     [ edit ]   Rin   Rin  (  ? )  is an orphan girl who finds Sesshomaru in the woods after he was badly injured by InuYasha's using the Wind Scar on him. Rin's family was killed by bandits, and she lives on the outskirts of her small village, having to fend for herself. Although Sesshomaru snubs her, she visits him regularly and attempts to take care of him. She steals fish from the village for him, only to learn he doesn't eat human food. The villagers beat her for the theft, and when Sesshomaru idly inquires about her injuries, she is disproportionately happy. She initially appears mute, as she doesn't speak to Sesshomaru, rather she makes hand gestures and smiles.   Later, the wolf-demon  Koga  chases a thief to the village. After killing the thief, Koga lets his wolves attack and kill the villagers to steal food. Rin escapes the village and runs through the forest towards Sesshomaru, but she trips along the path. The wolves catch up to her and attack her. Recovered from his wounds, Sesshomaru is leaving when he catches Rin's scent and follows it to her mauled and lifeless body. Remembering her smile, he states that he wishes to test his sword again then uses the Tenseiga to resurrect her. After setting Rin on her feet again, Sesshomaru walks away, leaving the dumbfounded Jaken and a wide-eyed Rin standing on the path. After a moment, they both follow. The next time Rin is seen, she is clean, wearing a new, colorful  kimono , and talking and acting more like a typical child.   Throughout the series, she is generally seen following Sesshomaru, whom she addresses as Lord Sesshomaru, or waiting for him with Ah-Un and sometimes Jaken while Sesshomaru is dealing with more dangerous tasks. Though Sesshomaru never speaks of having any feelings for her, he is shown to have a strong protective instinct, and its clear that Rin is devoted to him. At one time, she and many other children are captured by another demon that is destroyed by a group of monks lead by Ungai. Rin refuses to go with the monks as she knows Sesshomaru is already on his way, but Ungai attempts to force her to come. Rin fights him and calls for Sesshomaru, who reveals that he was indeed already there. The monks are unable to hurt him the same way they destroyed the lesser demons and Rin is freed from Ungai's hold. When she seems to hesitate to leave with him, Sesshomaru tells her to do as she wishes and walks away. She waves goodbye to Ungai and runs after him. Once they rejoin Jaken, Rin spots several graves along the path, and asks Sesshomaru to remember her after she dies. Sesshomaru appears surprised by the question and responds: ""Don't say such silly things."" [ 11 ]   Rin is killed for a second time in the series when she and Kohaku, now also journeying with Sesshomaru, are taken by the ""Dog from Hell."" When he finds her, Sesshomaru is visibly disturbed with a look of disbelief and shock on his face. It is at this point that he learns that Tenseiga can only revive a person once. Rin's lifeless body is taken by the Master of Hell, with Sesshomaru and Kohaku following to take it back. When they return from the Land of the Dead, Sesshomaru's mother uses her Meidou stone to revive Rin. Jaken confirms that it made Sesshomaru happy while Sesshomaru puts his hand on Rin's cheek.   In the final chapter of the manga, set three years after the defeat of Naraku, Rin no longer travels with Sesshomaru and Jaken. Instead, she lives with  Kaede , which InuYasha comments is ""practice"" for her to live in a human village as an adult, or whatever life she chooses. Sesshomaru is shown visiting her and bringing her gifts.   In the anime adaptation, Rin is voiced by  Mamiko Noto . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Brenna O'Brien .     [ edit ]   Ah-Un   Ah-Un  (  ,   A-Un ? )  is a two-headed dragon demon and  Sesshomaru 's loyal/domesticated beast of burden. He is one of the only two ykai in the series who is explicitly stated to be a  herbivore . Despite the fact that he has traveled with Sesshomaru for centuries, he did not have a name until after Rin gave him one, naming the right head ""Ah,"" and the left head ""Un."" Ah-Un can fire ykai energy from both mouths. The right head can shoot blue beams of lightning, while the left can shoot green lightning that can control clouds and possibly the weather. Also when it flies, a grey cloud-like gas gathers around its legs which is similar to the flaming versions of those around Kirara's.   On their journeys, Rin and Jaken often rest on his back when they are flying over great distances. When Sesshomaru leaves Rin in a safe place, either with Jaken or by herself, Ah-Un stays with her and will act as her protector if she is threatened. He saved Rin from a group of lesser demons when she went to collect an herb to save Jaken, who was dying from being poisoned by Naraku's  Saimysh . Ah-Un also defeated many of  Setsuna no Takemaru 's  zombie  warriors in  InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler .     [ edit ]   Naraku's group     [ edit ]   Naraku       Main article:  Naraku       Naraku  (  ? )  is the series' primary  antagonist . Naraku is responsible for many of the characters suffering, including the death of Kikyo [ 7 ]  and the sealing of InuYasha to the sacred tree. [ 12 ]  Naraku originated from a bandit named Onigumo, [ 12 ]  who made a deal with several demons in order to receive a new body so he may pursue his caretaker, Kikyo and gain possession of the  Shikon Jewel . [ 13 ]  Throughout the series' run, Naraku has created many detachments, to aid him in goal of killing those who oppose him and finding the shards of the  Shikon Jewel . In the anime adaptation, he is his voiced by  Toshiyuki Morikawa . [ 14 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Paul Dobson . [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Kanna   Kanna  (  ? )  is the first detachment of Naraku. She is a ykai who appears as a girl with white hair and clothing. Kanna carries with her a demonic  mirror , with which she can steal the souls of those reflected in it. Once a soul is trapped within her mirror, Kanna can control their host bodies to carry out her bidding. However, if a powerful soul is locked into the mirror it will overflow it, the mirror will start to crack, forcing Kanna to release all souls currently trapped within, or her mirror will shatter. [ 16 ]  The mirror also has the ability to create a glass demon that can copy the abilities of whatever it reflects, though Kanna receives all damage in the glass demon's stead. Being a ""concealed incarnation"" of Naraku, Kanna has no smell and no demonic aura [ 17 ] . This makes it impossible for InuYasha to detect her and makes her immune to demonic aura-related effects including Hakurei-zan barrier. Kanna is the only incarnation that Naraku trusts, telling her important information about his actions and allowing her to give orders to his other incarnations and pawns. In her last battle, Kanna is ordered by Naraku to commit suicide, shattering herself and the glass demon she was currently using into thousands of tiny shards. One of the shards hits Kagome's right eye, and using it Kanna directs her final thought into telling Kagome how to destroy Naraku.   In the anime adaptation, Kanna's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. She is voiced by  Yukana Nogami . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Janyse Jaud .     [ edit ]   Kagura   Kagura  (  ? )  is a creation of Naraku's, his second ""detachment."" A wind sorceress, Kagura primarily uses a wind-manipulating fan to enhance her powers and create wind-based attacks, including a blade like tornado attack and using wind to animate dead bodies. She can also use a pair of feathers that she wears in her hair for transportation, enlarging them then using them to ride in the wind.   Kagura hates her creator and wishes to be free from him. To this end, she often opposes him when she feels that Naraku will not notice, including offering aid to both  InuYasha  and  Sesshomaru  in hopes they will kill him. She most exercise caution, however, as he literally holds her heart, threatening to crush it and kill her if she betrays him. At times he has caught her defying him in action, or in thought when she is close enough for him to read her mind, he would squeeze her heart in his hands in front of her causing her to collapse in pain.   When Naraku charges her with guarding Gorymaru at a prison, Hakudshi convinces her to release him so he can destroy Naraku. She also learns that  Kohaku  has regained his memory, and they become allies, sharing information they gather about Naraku's weaknesses. Through this partnership, Kagura becomes protective of Kohaku, leading her to openly defy Naraku. She protects the boy when Hakudshi attempts to take his Shikon shard, which would kill Kohaku instantly. After Naraku kills Hakudshi, Kagura helps Kohaku escape from Naraku who also wants to kill the boy by removing the shard. Naraku mockingly returns her heart before fatally attacking her and leaving her to die. Sesshomaru finds the dying Kagura while tracking Naraku. Though he considers using his sword  Tenseiga  to save her, he realizes that the sword would not be able to revive her. Before dying, Kagura appears to be happy to have seen Sesshomaru again, hinting that she may have had some sort of feelings for him. InuYasha's group also arrives, helpless to do more than watch her body dissolve into the wind, giving her the freedom she always longed for. Afterwards, InuYasha asks Sesshomaru if she suffered. Sesshomaru replies that she was smiling when she died.   In the anime adaptation, Kagura's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. She is voiced by  Izumi Oogami .In the English dub, she is voiced by  Janyse Jaud .     [ edit ]   Kohaku   Kohaku  (  ? )  is Sango's younger brother, who was once under the control of Naraku. When Naraku disguised himself as Kagewaki Hitomi, the son of a lord, he used Lord Hitomi's father to call upon Sango and the demon slayers to slay a false demon. Naraku forced Kohaku to turn against his companions, killing his father and all the demon slayers. Sango survived solely by sheer luck. Castle guards also killed Kohaku that night, only to be later resurrected by Naraku as an amnesiac puppet. After several encounters with Sango and her friends, he began to recover his painful memories and sought to secretly find a way to destroy Naraku while still maintaining the illusion of being under his control; he later formed an alliance with Kagura, who sought freedom from Naraku's tyranny. Following Kagura's death, he joins Kikyo as he believes travelling with her will be the only way to redeem himself. He remains by her side until she tells him to separate from her for fear of being unable to keep his shard pure. However, he is nearly captured by Byakuya, and only a timely arrival by  Sesshomaru  saves him. Kohaku remains with Sesshomaru's group after this, and helps protect Rin, who he has a friendship with. In the last chapter of the manga, Kohaku goes with Kirara along with a new weapon which Totosai made for him. When Totosai asks him if he will visit his sister, Sango, he replies that he will not, since the house it getting too crowded. He then goes off with Kirara to become a better demon slayer. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Akiko Yajima . In the English dub, he is initially voiced by  Alex Doduk , then later by  Danny McKinnon .     [ edit ]   Goshinki   Goshinki  (  ? )  is Naraku's third detachment and takes the form of a large horned purple demon. [ 16 ]  Goshinki has the ability to read the thoughts of others, which enables him to outmaneuver InuYasha. Goshinki breaks the Tetsusaiga by biting it. However, by doing so he caused InuYasha's demon blood to takeover. After which Goshinki was no longer able read his thoughts, resulting in his death at the claws of InuYasha. Sesshomaru, realizing that Goshiki had broken Tetsusaiga, took his fangs and had the sword Tokijin made from them. [ 16 ]  In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Masaharu Sat . [ 18 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Kopsa . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Kageromaru   Kageromaru  (  ,   Kagermaru ? )  is the fourth detachment, a tiny slithering creature with a human head and two scythed-arms. Despite his form, Kagermaru is revealed to be quite fast, and can also tunnel in the ground. He resides in Juromaru's stomach, who is loyal only to him, where he can make surprise attacks on the enemy. Kageromaru has a love of eating the insides of people and ykai alike. Despite this, Kagermaru is revealed to be quite intelligent, and, unlike Juromaru, is shown being able to talk. He was killed along with his younger brother by InuYasha and Koga.     [ edit ]   Juromaru   Juromaru  (  ,   Jrmaru ? ) , the fifth incarnation, is perhaps the least loyal of all of the incarnation Naraku creates. Juromaru's only loyalty is his elder brother Kageromaru, who is hidden in Jrmaru's stomach when covered by a metal mask. When first introduced, Juromaru was chained up, possibly because his elder brother attempted to kill Naraku. Jrmaru has little intelligence and never speaks, characterized only by a lust to kill. He and his elder brother were killed by InuYasha and Koga.     [ edit ]   Muso   Muso  (  ,   Mus ? )  was separated from Naraku in his attempt to remove his human side, Onigumo, which would also remove Onigumo's love for Kikyo. He is the sixth detachment of Naraku. Naraku cared so little for the incarnation he neither named it or gave it a face. Muso took both his name and face from a wandering monk he slew. Muso ventured to Kikyo's former village, where he runs into InuYasha's group, and battles them quickly after their encounter. Soon Naraku quickly realizes, however, that he cannot abandon Onigumo when demons try to gain their freedom from his body, and Muso was absorbed back into Naraku. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hiroshi Yanaka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Brian Dobson .     [ edit ]   The Infant   The Infant  (  ,   Akago ? )  is Naraku's heart and seventh detachment, and is capable of speaking fluently. He is a baby that can possess anyone with the darkness in their heart. His main goal is to control Kagome's mind by finding the pain, anger, or jealousy within her heart, and use her abilities to find the remaining shards of the Shikon Jewel. He finds her jealousy of InuYasha's feelings for Kikyo, but InuYasha saves her before The Infant can control her. Like  Hakudoshi  and  Kagura , The Infant is not loyal to  Naraku . He is destroyed along with  Moryomaru  by  Naraku . In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ai Kobayashi .     [ edit ]   Hakudoshi   Hakudoshi  (  ,   Hakudshi ? )  is the eighth detachment from Naraku and created from The Infant's body, he was Entei's final master and takes the form of a young child. Like Naraku, his heart is not inside his body, so he is able to endlessly regenerate himself. Due to being created from The Infant, he is capable of using all of The Infant's abilities, and can regenerate from any damage, as his heart is not in his body, but inside his brother, The Infant. Hakudoshi is able to tame a fire-horse named Entei  (  ? ) , which Hakudoshi used to move from place to place prior to Entei's destruction. Hakudoshi also claims a  naginata  from a pig demon. Hakudoshi uses this to decapitate ogres and use their heads to see into the borderland between the dead and living worlds.   Over time, both The Infant and Hakudoshi grow tired of Naraku's rule over them, and seek to betray and overthrow him. To help The Infant in battle and protect him, Hakudoshi creates Moryomaru. Naraku eventually realized their wish to betray him, however, and Naraku instructs his  Saimyosho  to abandon Hakudoshi in battle, giving him no protection against  Miroku 's Wind Tunnel, and he is destroyed.   In the anime adaptation, Hakudoshi's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. He is voiced by  Ai Kobayashi . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Chiara Zanni .     [ edit ]   Byakuya   Byakuya  (  ? )  is Naraku's ninth and final detachment, meant to replace Kagura. He is loyal to Naraku and has an incredible power of creating illusions. His main purpose was to observe InuYasha and Mrymaru's growing powers and report these observations back to Naraku, though was never given details about these missions, much like Kagura, and had chosen to stay protective of his own life after witnessing Kanna's death. Byakuya has the power to possess people with paper soldiers, summon vines to entrap his enemies, teleport others to different dimensions, detach  organs  from his body, and erect barriers. He travels on a giant  origami  paper  crane .   After taking the power of one slash of InuYasha's Meidou Zangetsuha, he later slashes Kagome with the blade. However, before he gets a chance at a second strike, InuYasha attacks him with his Medou Zangetsuha and Byakuya is absorbed into it. When Naraku dies, a Meidou appears behind Kagome, due to Byakuya's Meidou Blade.     [ edit ]   Moryomaru   Moryomaru  (  ,   Mrymaru ? )  was an enemy of Naraku. He was a 100-foot long monster in a human form who could shoot blasts of energy from his arm. At first, he is merely a life force puppet, the more refined of various such creations made from ykai by Hakudshi, and as such, he had no true personality, soul or will. He is given to Kanna, who places The Infant inside of him, giving Moryomaru Naraku's physical life force. Moryomaru begins to increase more and more in power as he absorbs different  ykai  to gain their abilities. During a battle, he nearly defeats an onslaught of most of Naraku's enemies which included  Kikyo , Kohaku,  Kagome , InuYasha,  Miroku , Sango,  Shippo , and Sesshomaru. He succeeds in breaking Sesshomaru's sword, but flees after nearly losing a shard of the Shikon Jewel. He is killed when he devours Naraku, and Naraku absorbs his power from the inside and uses it to be reborn.     [ edit ]   Princess Abi   Princess Abi is the princess of featherless blood-sucking fire bird yokai and servant to Naraku. Her mother, Queen Tekkei, became ill after she ate a poisoned ykai, which prompted Princess Abi to collect blood for her. After attacking several villages, Naraku had appeared to make a deal with her; he would give her weapons and become his servant in exchange for his blood. Princess Abi eventually attempts to fight with InuYasha, though the battle ends with him leaving her after destroying her shield. Princess Abi grew suspicious of Naraku over time and decides to betray him. To prove she isn't an ally, she attempts to attack The Infant, one of Naraku's offspring. After a quick battle with InuYasha, Princess Abi leaves, finally having enough blood for her mother. However, Naraku decides to reveal his true intent to use Tekkei to get into the border between the worlds of the living and the dead. Tekkei, finally revealing her full form of a giant bird ykai, attacks and swallows Naraku, who responds by decapitating her from the inside. Naraku then kills Princess Abi painlessly, a reward for being useful, and uses Tekkei's blood to create a pathway between the living and dead worlds.     [ edit ]   Band of Seven   The Band of Seven  (  ,   Shichinintai ? ) , are seven  mercenaries  brought back to life by Naraku using the Shikon Jewel shards. All of their names end in  kotsu   (  ? ) , meaning ""bone"".     [ edit ]   Bankotsu   Bankotsu  (  ? )  is the leader,and the strongest member of the Band of Seven. He is also the youngest of the group. He carries the huge Banryu  halberd . Bankotsu is a skilled mercenary and has killed many people; however, he frequently shows a sense of honor and compassion, though only for his six companions.   After being brought back to life, Bankotsu seeks his weapon, Banryu, and kills everyone in the surrounding area once he succeeds. The scent of blood draws InuYasha's group to him, and Bankotsu engages in battle with them. However, Bankotsu and the Band of Seven are called back by Naraku after InuYasha's Wind Scar nicked Banryu. He took the jewel shards Renkotsu stole from Kagome to repair his damaged blade, giving it the power to deflect the Wind Scar. Later, Bankotsu soon realizes how deceptive Renkotsu has become, killing him when he learned Renkotsu murdered Jakotsu. With 7 fragments in his body and two in his halberd, Bankotsu headed off to destroy InuYasha deep inside Mount Hakurei. In the manga, InuYasha wins slowly cuts the Shikon shards out of his body as the battle progresses until Bankotsu was cut in two, with Naraku stripping the remaining half of its shikon jewel shard. In the anime, Bankotsu slew 1,000 ykai and killed 1,000 warlords with Banryu. Banryu, in turn, transformed into a demonic weapon with the ability to release physical manifestations of its users' hatred in the form of powerful demonic energy. However, this proves to be his downfall as InuYasha takes the opportunity and unleashes the Backlash Wave, crushing Bankotsu and shattering Banry.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Takeshi Kusao . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Matt Hill .     [ edit ]   Renkotsu   Renkotsu  (  ? )  is the second in command and is the third strongest member of the Band of Seven. He became resentful of Bankotsu's power and dares to betray him. After Ginkotsu self-destructed to save Renkotsu from Koga, Renkotsu took Ginkotsu's shard and stuck it in his wounded shoulder. Later, he killed the injured Jakotsu after his battle with InuYasha and took his jewel shard. As punishment for hiding the shards and killing Jakotsu, Bankotsu kills him. Renkotsu was an expert with explosives and metallurgy who used bombs, cannons, wires that will be lit afire, and a special concoction that he drinks to spit fire. He was also a gifted strategist, and possessed some skill at hand to hand combat although the only members of the group he surpassed in fighting skills was Mukotsu and Kyokotsu. He was also skilled at mechanical work, to the point of being able to reconstruct Ginkotsu into a living artillery weapon resembling a modern tank. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Tomokazu Sugita . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Brian Drummond .     [ edit ]   Jakotsu   Jakotsu  (  ? ) , the second strongest of the Band of Seven and the third in command, was close friends with Bankotsu before the group was formed. Bankotsu notes that Jakotsu is the only person he trusts. He fights using a sword called the  Jakotsuto , which has snake-like, retractable blades that make it difficult for an opponent to calculate Jakotsu's next move. Jakotsu engages in a lengthy battle with InuYasha, but loses. With him badly wounded, Renkotsu steals his Shikon Shard, causing him to die. As he dies, Jakotsu said he is happy because he got to fight the battle he wanted and he had fun with his second chance in life. Bankotsu later avenges his friends death by killing Renkotsu. Jakotsu is depicted acting in a  homosexual  manner, claiming to have feelings for InuYasha. However, coupled with his sadism, he basically wants to kill in what he considers to be an affectionate way. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ai Orikasa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Jenn Forgie .     [ edit ]   Suikotsu   Suikotsu  (  ? )  is the fourth strongest of the Band of Seven. Has a  split personality ; ""Doctor Suikotsu"" is good, kind, and respected by villagers and ""Suikotsu of the Band of Seven"" is evil and blood-thirsty. The evil side emerged when he was traumatized by seeing a child killed in front of him. Mount Hakurei's purity tends to favor Doctor Suikotsu, and after transforming into both forms, he emerges back at the village he practiced at without the markings on his face, but still violent and willing to kill. He was soon beaten by both Sesshomaru and Kikyo's sacred arrow when he used Rin as a hostage, and, after explaining how he had overcome his double personality, asked Kikyo to remove the Shikon Jewel shard from his neck and let him die peacefully. Respecting his wishes, Kikyo reached to retrieve the jewel, but was stopped as Jakotsu removed it himself and took it to Bankotsu. Suikotsu uses iron claws with exceptionally long blades as weapon. He also possesses phenomenal strength, agility, and savage combat skills due to his unique form of mania and bloodlust. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hiroaki Hirata . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Donovan .     [ edit ]   Ginkotsu   Ginkotsu  (  ? )  has metal parts on his body and various amounts of weaponry within and is the fifth strongest of the Band of Seven. His speech is rarely intelligible, only changing when angered. He barely survives his first encounter with InuYasha and is reconstructed into a siege tank with spider-like legs by Renkotsu. Later, he fought Koga with Renkotsu. In the manga, he exploded when Koga had stuffed pieces of Renkotsu's armor into his cannons, causing them to backfire. In the anime, he survived this attack, but went berserk when Renkotsu received a heavy wound to his left shoulder, causing Ginkotsu to unleash every weapon he had on Koga to no avail. Ginkotsu then self-destructed in an explosion while shielding Renkotsu with his own jewel shard in an effort to save Renkotsu's life.   While in his more human form, he carries a  katana , an axe attached with a chain, a spear, ""steel"" wires, a grappler that replaced his left arm, disk-blades, a cannon on his shoulder, and a drill in his chest. In his tank form, his offense is two main cannons along with the ""steel"" wires. For movement, he has spider-like legs along with disk-blade wheels. In the anime, his additional weapons include a larger array of firearms, as well as launching his main body off like a rocket, which contains wire launchers and a flamethrower. His final weapon is a self-destruct mechanism.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hisao Egawa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Mark Gibbon .     [ edit ]   Mukotsu   Mukotsu  (  ? )  is a short poison master and is the sixth strongest of the Band of Seven. He abducts Kagome and, in the anime, tries to have a wedding ceremony with her but becomes angry at her due to her reaction to his facial features, and tries to kill her when she tries to remove his Shikon Jewel shard. However, in the manga, Mukotsu tries to come onto Kagome until she stabs him, and soon after Miroku and Sango appear. Mukotsu poisons Kagome, Miroku, and Sango, nearly killing them, but was soon killed by Sesshomaru, on whom his poisons have no effect. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Tetsu Inada . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Trevor Devall .     [ edit ]   Kyokotsu   Kyokotsu  (  ? )  is a giant, large and slow witted. He is the largest, but weakest of the Band of Seven. His size is his weapon, and proves to be a formidable foe. Against Koga, Kyokotsu also used a giant iron ball attached to a long chain like a flail-like weapon, which proved to be of little use due to Koga's speed. He terrorized ykai-wolf tribes, who were defenseless before his size and invulnerability. Despite his massive size and fearsome looks, Kyokotsu is human. Kyokotsu is defeated when, while holding Kga with his hand near his face Koga takes the jewel shard from his forehead, instantly killing him. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Daisuke Gri . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Mark Gibbon     [ edit ]   Supporting characters     [ edit ]   Kaede   Kaede  (  ? )  is Kikyo's younger sister. As a child, Kaede accompanied Kikyo as she worked, helping her with various tasks such as gathering herbs or holding her arrows. After her sister's death, Kaede became a miko in her own right and defends the village against  demons . When  Kagome  arrives, Kaede recognizes her as the reincarnation of Kikyo. After Kagome free's InuYasha, Kaede uses her abilities to puts the ""Beads of Subjugation"" on him to give Kagome the power to control him with a spoken word. She often shares advice and knowledge about demons and other spiritual anomalies with InuYasha's group. Kaede is well-respected and held in high regards by the villagers and the members of InuYasha's group. Though InuYasha is easily annoyed with her, he listens to her when necessary and doesn't hesitate to protect her from a threat.   Kaede is shown as having lost an eye sometime during her life. In the manga, it is never stated how this happened. In the anime adaptation, it is said that she lost it during a demon attack on the village.   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Hisako Kyoda . In the Viz English dub, she is voiced by  Pam Hyatt  who depicts her with an archaic tone and vocabulary, such as using "" ye "" even extra-grammatically as an  accusative  and  dative .     [ edit ]   Totosai   Totosai  (  ,   Ttsai ? )  is an elderly blacksmith ykai and an old friend of  InuYasha and Sesshomaru's father . He spends most of his time at his forge, located within a volcano, where he works to create and repair his customer's swords. When he goes out, he travels on a flying three eyed ox named M-M. He forged both Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga, the swords which belong to  InuYasha  and  Sesshomaru , respectively. Their father entrusted him to help his two sons master their respective swords. As the series progresses, he strengthens both swords as InuYasha grows stronger and Sesshomaru grows more compassionate, the requirements needed for each to be considered more capable of handling the blades.   Much to InuYasha's annoyance, Totosai is often absent-minded and will abruptly forget what is happening, even in the middle of a battle. He occasionally scolds with InuYasha on how he uses Tetsusaiga, lamenting that his sword is in the hands of someone he feels is so unworthy. His complains have helped annoy InuYasha enough to help him increase in power.   Though Totosai often acts like a cowardly old man, he is capable of breathing fire and wields a giant forging hammer. His hammer can open large fire pits when stuck on the ground, and he has been shown to be strong enough to pause an attack from Sesshomaru long enough to allow InuYasha to get away. At the end of the series, he allows Kohaku to work for him.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Jji Yanami . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Richard Newman .     [ edit ]   Hachiemon   Hachiemon  (  ? )  is a  tanuki , who goes by the nickname  Hachi . Hachi calls Miroku ""Master"" and is willing to do what Miroku asks. In the anime, he once took the form of Miroku to sell fake seals and exorcisms and have his way with the ladies. The eventual result was that while Hachi was being assaulted by a weasle demon, Miroku intervened and saved Hachie from the demon. Hachi sometimes acts as the transportation for InuYasha's group by transforming into a large yellow  blimp -like creature. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Toshihiko Nakajima . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Terry Klassen .     [ edit ]   Kikyo       Main article:  Kikyo       Kikyo  (  ,   Kiky ? )  is a powerful shrine maiden who loved InuYasha and was killed by Naraku (disguised as InuYasha), who made the two fight fifty years before the start of the story. She is brought back to life by the ogress Urasue, using soil from her grave and a part of Kagome's soul. Although she looks alive, her body is still ""dead,"" and she must ingest the souls of dead women in order to move. Her body is made of clay and graveyard soil and is considered a ""clay doll."" Although she is initially driven by hate, trying to drag InuYasha to hell and to kill Kagome, her village considers her a heroine, and Kikyo gradually returns to the love-motivated and caring personality she possessed while alive. However, once she discovered the truth about how Naraku killed her, she wanted revenge on Naraku. In episode 14 of the anime, InuYasha admits that he would go to hell for/with Kikyo. In the manga, Naraku kills her and she dies in the arms of InuYasha. In the latter chapters of the manga, she and  Kohaku  work together; she protects Kohaku and saves his life. She dies in InuYasha's arms after being attacked by Naraku. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Noriko Hidaka . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Willow Johnson       From left to right Hakkaku, Koga, and Ginta.         [ edit ]   Koga   Koga  (  ,   Kga ? )  is the young leader of the southern ykai-wolf tribe, who wishes to avenge his fallen comrades who were slaughtered by Kagura, one of Naraku's minions. While brash and arrogant, he is shrewd enough to run from a fight if he thinks he cannot win. He had three Shikon jewel shards, one in each of his legs and one in his right arm, which gave him increased speed and strength. He soon lost the shard in his arm in his fight with Kagura after she slayed his companions and lost the other two in a fight with Naraku later in the manga. He is first battled by InuYasha, after allowing his pack to eat villagers, (including Sesshomaru's friend Rin) though Koga retreats after sensing that InuYasha would use his Wind Scar. Although he bickers with InuYasha constantly, one will help when the other is in danger. Koga courts Kagome, protects her whenever possible, and professes love to, which irritates InuYasha, though Kagome doesn't share his affections. Later, his entire pack, with the exception of Ginta and Hakkaku, are destroyed by Naraku. Koga vows to destroy Naraku after this he is joined by two young wolf demons in the manga who leave with Hakkakku and Ginta when he sends them away. After losing the jewel shards in his legs he leaves and disappears from the manga, but first he tells Kagome that she may leave InuYasha and come to him if she ever feels the need. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Taiki Matsuno . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Scott McNeil .     [ edit ]   Ginta   Ginta  (  ? )  is one of Koga's followers. His hair is silver, with a dark blue piece in the center. He has mostly fur for his armor. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hiroyuki Yoshino . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Paul Dobson .     [ edit ]   Hakkaku   Hakkaku  (  ? )  is also one of Koga's followers. He has a white  mohawk , chain armor, and a fur hide. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Daisuke Kishio . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Alistair Abell .     [ edit ]   Ayame   Ayame  (  ,   Ayame ? )  is a wolf girl in love with Koga. Long ago, during the night of the lunar rainbow, Koga made a promise to marry her. Yet he fails to fulfill his promise. When Ayame comes to get Koga, he states that he is going to marry Kagome. She has red hair that is always in two ponytails with an iris in it, and her eyes are green. Her clothing consists of white wolf fur draped over her shoulders, a necklace, and armor that is red and blue. She is only seen in the anime, and is not present in the manga. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Yumi Kakazu . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Natalie Walters .     [ edit ]   Minor characters     [ edit ]   The Great Dog Demon   The Great Dog Demon  (  ,   Inu no Taish ? )  was a powerful  ykai  lord who was known throughout Japan. He fathered both  Sesshomaru  with another dog demon who appears in the manga and  InuYasha  with a human woman, Izayoi. He is never formally addressed with a name. The Great Dog Demon was first mentioned in chapter 12 of the manga, revealing that he was InuYasha's father and ""a demon dog that prowled the lands of the west"". Sesshomaru, the eldest son, was searching for the heirloom sword Tetsusaiga, which was supposed to be enshrined in his father's tomb. However, the gateway to the tomb had been hidden in a black pearl in InuYasha's right eye. The black pearl was a mystical gem that the Great Dog Demon obtained from  Hosenki  in order to create a path to where he hid his grave, in the boundary between the mortal world and the next. However, the origin of the pearl and the precise location of the grave were not revealed until much later in the story, chapters 298 and 297, respectively. the Great Dog Demon's tomb was first depicted in chapter 15, and was in the form of an enormous dog skeleton adorned in a suit of armor.  Myga  revealed that the Great Dog Demon had died with a considerable number of years behind him, and that he was now displayed as his true form free of any transformation. Within the skeleton was entombed the sword Tetsusaiga, forged from the Great Dog Demon's own fang. However, the sword had a barrier on it that prevented any non-human that has malevolence towards humans from touching it, which prevented Sesshomaru from claiming the sword as his own. Tetsusaiga also had the property of being unable to unleash its true power unless it was done for the benefit of humans. Because of these qualities, it was InuYasha who inherited the sword rather than Sesshomaru, after Kagome had pulled the sword from its resting place. Its sheath has a barrier of its own that can protect the one holding it from almost any attack.   The Great Dog Demon's major foe in the manga was the dragon  Rykotsusei . He could not completely kill Rykotsusei, and was only able to seal him to a cliff face with his claw before he died. The manga makes no mention of precisely how quickly the Great Dog Demon died following this altercation, but Myga called the battle the ""cause"" of his death. In the third  InuYasha  film,  InuYasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler , the Great Dog Demon survived long enough to save Izayoi and their newborn child InuYasha. He was still weak from his battle with Ryukotsusei, but put protecting the  laboring  Izayoi above all else and recklessly rushed into battle, which caused his demise. Another foe in the manga is the ykai Shishinki. Shishinki was the originator of the Meidou Zangetsuha technique, which the Great Dog Demon stole from him using Tetsusaiga's ability to absorb a defeated enemy's powers. Shishinki was left for dead, having been dealt a blow that took off the entire left side of his head, but he survived and returned to challenge Sesshomaru later.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Akio Otsuka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Don Brown .     [ edit ]   InuYasha's mother   InuYasha's mother, who is never named in the manga nor the anime adaptation, is primarily seen through flashbacks, as she was already dead at the start of the series. The daughter of a feudal lord, she is depicted as being a gentle, beautiful woman who loved InuYasha's father. She is also shown expressing sorrow for a young InuYasha over his being shunned by other children because of his half-demon status. Little is revealed about her family, age, or even how she died, with InuYasha only noting that she died ""a long time ago"" and that her manner of death ""wasn't her fault."" Upon her death, InuYasha was left with the Robe of the Fire Rat, which his father had given his mother to protect her on the night InuYasha was born, and a shell containing his mother's favorite lip coloring which he gave to Kikyo. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Kikuko Inoue . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Alaina Burnett . The third  InuYasha  film,  InuYasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler , which is not directly based on the manga, gives InuYasha's mother the name  Izayoi   (  ? ) . The film also creates a history for her, showing her being guarded in a castle by Setsuna no Takemaru and his samurai on the night of InuYasha's birth who wish to kill the Great Dog Demon, knowing he would come for her. Izayoi pleads with Takemaru to leave, knowing the Great Dog Demon would kill him, but Takemaru claims he loves her, then fatally stabs her in the chest with a spear. Before she dies, she is able to give birth to InuYasha. The Great Dog Demon, already injured by his battle with  Rykotsusei , fights his way through Takemaru's men and the burning building to reach his dead lover and his newborn child. He uses the  Tenseiga  sword to save her life then covers her with the Robe of the Fire Rat and orders her to flee. Before she leaves, he names his son InuYasha. The Great Dog Demon remained behind to fight Takemaru to the death as Izayoi fled with their child.     [ edit ]   Ryukotsusei   Ryukotsusei  (  ,   Rykotsusei ? )  is a giant dragon daiykai who fought InuYasha's father, the Great Dog Demon. Though he wasn't killed, Ryukotsusei was sealed away with one of his claws. However, the wounds the Great Dog Demon received from the battle caused him to die shortly after. Following Ttsai's explanation,  InuYasha  stubbornly went to fight Ryukotsusei so that Tetsusaiga, his sword, would become lighter and easier to use again. Myga informs InuYasha that since the dragon is already sealed, all he must do is stab the dragon in the heart to kill it and ""surpass his father"". However, InuYasha complains that this is not his style and would prefer to fight the dragon head on. InuYasha has his wish fulfilled when  Naraku  removes his father's seal so that the dragon would awaken to destroy InuYasha. Ryukotsusei has an incredible armored hide that is nearly impenetrable and his power level is also high enough so that when he fired a blast from his mouth,  Miroku 's wind tunnel was unable to absorb the attack and only slightly changed its trajectory away from InuYasha. Ryukotsusei is ruthless and has a mask that exists on his forehead through which he speaks. His attack is Thunder Attack Bullet, a giant white ball of explosive energy, which he emits from his mouth, and could easily have defeated InuYasha if not for InuYasha learning Explosive Flowing Wave just in time to defeat the dragon.   Ryukotsusei is seen in the second ending,  Fukai Mori , when Sesshomaru visits where he was sealed. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kazuhiko Inoue . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Trevor Devall .     [ edit ]   Hakushin   Hakushin  (  ? )  was once a great monk that helped people during a famine. When he became sick and was dying, the people buried him alive on an island called Hijiri so that he could become a "" living Buddha "". He was unable to give up his attachment to live to achieve full Buddha-hood.  Naraku  found him on Hijiri and revives him into a living mummy. Naraku convinces Hakushin that he hated those who buried him and to help him by erecting a barrier around Mount Hakurei that purifies every creature that has supernatural or demonic powers and prevents people from acting on impure or evil thoughts. The barrier causes InuYasha to change into his human form, prevents Miroku from groping women, slightly slows Sesshomaru's speed, and greatly weakens Kikyo. After hearing the story of Hakushin, Miroku and Sango search the mountain and find him, but are unable to convinces nor force him to remove the barrier. Hakushin later runs into Kikyo, who is able to persuade him to remove the barrier and pass on to death so he could find peace. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Fumio Matsuoka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Hiro Kanagawa .     [ edit ]   Hosenki   Hosenki  (  ,   Hsenki ? )  is an oyster-demon who cultivates a variety of magical jewels. He created the black pearl in  InuYasha 's right eye that enabled Sesshomaru to travel to his father's grave and try to steal Tetsusaiga, the sword his father willed to InuYasha. Later in the series, InuYasha's group needs to travel to the nether world and seek out Hosenki, but learn he has died and his son, who shares his name, can not make the gems yet. They find another path to the world where they find the departed Hosenki sitting among the bone's of InuYasha's father's body. However, he had been corrupted by a corrupted shard of the Shikon Jewel and attacked InuYasha. After Naraku reclaimed his shard, Hosenki returned to normal and taught InuYasha how to use Tetsusaiga's  Adamant Barrage  attack. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ryzabur tomo . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Dave Pettitt .     [ edit ]   Jinenji   Jinenji   (  ? )  is a half-human, half-horse demon who lives in a hut with his human mother. Together they grow a variety of medicinal plants, including some known for being powerful against poisons. He is first seen when Kirara is poisoned by Naraku's  shki  and Kagome and InuYasha travel to the village to find a cure. When they find him, they also help to clear his name as he was being falsely blamed for people's deaths in the village purely because of his demon blood. Jinenji is depicted as a gentle giant who is initially scared of humans because of the way the villagers treat him. Upon meeting Kagome, he is surprised to find that she is not frightened by his appearance at all and willingly helps him collect herbs. InuYasha, having also dealt with abuse at the hands of humans when he was a child, attempts to convince Jinenji that he needs to be more forceful towards the villagers, especially after he rescues them from a demon. In the end, Jinenji decides to continue his more gentle approach, giving the men injured during the demon attack the herbs they need to heal themselves. Like InuYasha, Jinenji becomes fully human one day a month. During one of these times, Rin visits his home searching for the same cure to heal Jaken, who was poisoned by the wasps while protecting her. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hisao Egawa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Dobson .     [ edit ]   Magatsuhi   Magatsuhi  (  ? )  is the ykai who killed Midoriko and whose soul with whom she continuously battles inside the jewel. Like Naraku, Magatsuhi was created by a corrupt human who lusted after a priestess and allowed his body to be consumed by ykai. However, unlike Naraku, who retains a humanoid form, Magatsuhi's true form is much more monstrous. Magatsuhi is first seen in manga chapter 89 as the mummified corpse of an unnamed but massive demon. Later in the manga, the demon's name is revealed to be Magatsuhi, and it is able to (temporarily) escape the jewel and create a humanoid body out of some of Naraku's spare parts. However, this body was soon destroyed by Sesshomaru and InuYasha. In chapter 555 in the manga, InuYasha saw Magatsuhi combating Midoriko inside the Shikon Jewel.   Magatsuhi states that if Kagome were to make a selfish wish on the Jewel, Kagome would replace Midoriko in the eternal fight and Naraku would replace Magatsuhi. InuYasha refuses to believe Magatsuhi, and proceeds to attack it in an attempt to reach Kagome. In the end he and Naraku were destroyed forever by InuYasha when he cuts the point of light in the darkness inside the Shikon Jewel with the Meidou Zangetsuha and arrives in the meidou outside the jewel to save Kagome. Then Kagome makes the right wish; the wish that would exterminate the jewel from the world forever; the wish for the Shikon no Tama to disappear. The jewel breaks; disappears, and InuYasha and Kagome are transported back to earthen ground.     [ edit ]   Midoriko   Midoriko  (  ? )  is a shrine maiden of great spiritual power from many centuries before the  Sengoku period . She had the power to destroy demons by purifying their souls, and was considered the most powerful living human alive in her time. During this time, Kirara was her companion. During a battle with a powerful group of demons, she tired and was unable to purify a fierce demon's soul that she had seized. As she neared death in battle, she thrust forth her soul from her body, and by taking and enveloping the souls of the demon with which she battled, the sacred jewel was formed. Her soul remained locked in battle with the ykai's soul inside the Shikon Jewel until Naraku killed her with Magatsuhi's wish.     [ edit ]   Mushin   Mushin  (  ? )  is the lecherous monk who took care of young Miroku when his father died as a result of the Wind Tunnel curse. Miroku got his lecherous tendencies from his caretaker. Mushin was once possessed by a Urn Grub and almost killed Miroku. Mushin resides in a shrine next to the grave of Miroku's father. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Yuzuru Fujimoto . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Alec Willows .     [ edit ]   Tsubaki   Tsubaki  (  ? )  is a dark shrine maiden who made a deal with a demon to retain her youth and beauty. In her youth, she was Kikyo's rival and sees her chance at revenge when she encounters Kagome. She met her end when Naraku lured her to do his bidding with the almost complete Shikon no Tama and she underestimated Kagome's abilities. She appeared in anime only episodes 6064 as the Dark Priestess ().     [ edit ]   References       ^  a   b   c   Takahashi, Rumiko (1998). ""Chapter 01"".  InuYasha, Volume 1 . Viz Media.

Kagome Higurashi       InuYasha  character         Kagome portrayed in the anime       First appearance   "" The Girl Who Overcame Time... and the Boy Who Was Just Overcome ""       Created by   Rumiko Takahashi       Voiced by   Satsuki Yukino  (Japanese)   Moneca Stori  (English)       Profile       Age   15 [ 1 ]       Species   Human       Known relatives   Grandfather  Mother  Sota Higurashi (brother)       Weapon   Bow and arrow (sacred arrows)  Spiritual powers (reiki)       Kagome Higurashi   (     , Higurashi Kagome ? )  is a  fictional character  and one of the  protagonists  in the  anime  and  manga  series  InuYasha , created by  Rumiko Takahashi .     [ edit ]   Overview   Kagome is a young girl of this manga and anime series. Her grandfather is the keeper of the Higurashi shrine which is a Shinto shrine near Tokyo. On her fifteenth birthday, Kagome tries to save her cat from falling down the shrine well and she is pulled into the Bone Eater's well by Mistress Centipede. This takes her back into time to the Warring States Period (Sengoku Jidai) of Japan, where she finds the half demon whose name is InuYasha.     [ edit ]   Powers and abilities     Purification Powers    This ability means anything Kagome touches gets purified. By gathering an enormous amount of concentrated power into her right palm, she can direct it at her opponents. [ 2 ]  She also uses this to purify the Jewel.       Spiritual Powers    Kagome can pass through barriers, spells, and/or illusions. Kagome is also able to sense evil auras and is unaffected by them. If possible, she is able to surround herself with her own spiritual powers to ward off any evil. It is later revealed that her powers are, to a great extent, sealed by the  Shikon no Tama , so she may have other powers than these.  [ 3 ]  According to Rumiko Takahashi, Kagome is potentially much stronger than Kikyo herself. Because Kagome is the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome most likely has Kikyo's power to add to her own. [ citation needed ]  In chapter 539 of the manga, when Magatsuhi was killed by Sesshoumaru, the complete extent of Kagome's spiritual powers were released.   Shikon Jewel Detecting    This allows her to sense the exact location of the Shikon Jewel shards. While other characters have shown a vague ability to see Shikon shards, only Kagome and Kikyo are able to sense the shards remotely.       Time Travel    Kagome can travel back and forth 500 years between the present and the Feudal era using the magical well behind her family's shrine. [ 4 ]  InuYasha and Kagome seem to be the only two characters in the series who are capable of doing so.       In the final chapters of the series, after the destruction of the Shikon Jewel, the well appears to temporarily shut down for three years. Kagome attempts to go back in time regularly, but is unsuccessful. However, after her high school graduation, she successfully time travels through the well.       Beads of Subjugation (Sit)   Placed around InuYasha's neck by Kaede and empowered to ""subdue"" him at a word from Kagome. This slams InuYasha into the ground whenever she says the words ""sit"". The effect wears off quickly and InuYasha is able to get up again.       Kyd  (lit. Way of the Bow)   Kagome uses a basic bow as a weapon. Once she infuses her powers into the bow, she can use it to reflect an enemy's attack. Kagome uses a  shortbow . This changes when later on in the manga, she locates a  longbow  with special spiritual powers. [ 5 ]  It has the power to strike evil spirits or the user's intended target bypassing others, if the opponent should happen to be using a hostage as a shield, the arrow will bypass the hostage and hit the enemy instead, only by using this particular bow. [ 6 ]   Sacred Arrow   Kagome infuses her powers into her arrows. This allows the arrows to penetrate demonic forces and to purify objects.   Sacred Backlash Wave   This attack is actually a combined effort between InuYasha and Kagome. [ 7 ]  It consists of Kagome firing one of her Sacred Arrows into the center of InuYasha's Backlash Wave before it connects. When it hits the enemy there is a higher chance that he will be destroyed by the combined powers.

This is a  list of characters  from  InuYasha , the  manga  and  anime  series by  Rumiko Takahashi .   The characters can be split into several groups. The group of protagonists, headed by InuYasha and Kagome, is the main acting unit in the series. It takes place in vast majority of events and conveys the story's main plot: the collection of Shikon Jewel Shards and the gradual transformation of the characters through love, affection and numerous trials they come through together. Naraku's group unites the main antagonists and is the ""ultimate enemy"" to be defeated. Other groups and characters play various roles including a few subplots of different significance.

[ edit ]   InuYasha   Main article:  InuYasha (character)   InuYasha  (    ? )  is the  protagonist  of the  manga  and  anime . InuYasha is a half-demon, born to a dog demon father and human mother. InuYasha was sealed to the sacred tree 500 years before the start of the series by the  priestess   Kikyo , and released by  Kagome  who turns out to be Kikyo's reincarnation. [ 1 ]  InuYasha desires the  Shikon Jewel  so he may become a full demon. He often clashes with his older half-brother,  Sesshomaru , who desires his sword the Tetsusaiga, a supernatural sword made from one of their deceased father's fangs. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kappei Yamaguchi . [ 2 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Richard Ian Cox . [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Kagome Higurashi   Main article:  Kagome Higurashi   Kagome Higurashi  (     , Higurashi Kagome ? )  is the second protagonist of the series. She is the reincarnation of the priestess Kikyo, who died 500 years before the start of the series. [ 1 ]  Kagome was pulled into the Bone Eater's Well by a demon who wanted the Shikon Jewel, which was hidden in her body, sending her back to the  Feudal Era . [ 1 ] [ 4 ]  Kagome takes over Kikyo's task of protecting the Shikon Jewel, but accidentally shatters it with her arrow. Due to the fact that she is the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome possesses great spiritual power and is able to purify tainted shards of the jewel. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Satsuki Yukino . [ 5 ]  In the English dub, she is voiced by  Moneca Stori . [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Miroku   Miroku  (    ? )  is a  Buddhist monk  who traveled the countryside performing (mostly fictitious) services such as exorcisms and demon exterminations to earn his living. He suffers from a hereditary curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather Miyatsu by Naraku. [ 7 ]  The hole in his hand became a Wind Tunnel, which sucks in almost anything in its path. The Wind Tunnel proves to be a powerful weapon against demons, but grows larger as time passes. He joins InuYasha and Kagome in hopes that he will be able to find and kill Naraku so he may break the curse before it consumes him, like his grandfather and father. [ 7 ]  Miroku also uses his holy staff and several scrolls to attack enemies. Miroku first meets InuYasha after he steals the Shikon Jewel. InuYasha attacks Miroku and Miroku quickly uses his Wind Tunnel. Realizing he won't harm humans, Kagome stands in his path. Miroku quickly covers the Wind Tunnel, and after explaining his situation, InuYasha allows him to join their group. Miroku has a habit of asking random women to bear his child so that, in the case that he would die defeating Naraku, he would have an heir. A running gag is Miroku's  lechery , specifically shameless flattery and occasional  groping  with varying subtlety. After his father had died, Miroku was raised by a monk named Mushin, and learned his lecherous tendencies from him. At the end of the series, Miroku is no longer bearing the wind tunnel, and marries Sango. They have three children,  twin  girls and a boy.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kji Tsujitani . [ 8 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Kirby Morrow . [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Sango   Sango  (    ? )  is a demon slayer who hails from a village of professional demon slayers. Sango wields the Hiraikotsu, a massive boomerang made of purified demon bones, along with a broad repertoire of tools and tricks, which are used for fighting demons. Sango and the souls of the purified demons of Hiraikotsu share a deep connection, and when she puts the weapon in danger to save Miroku, they chide her for it and ask that she put themselves above him. She is constantly seen with her companion Kirara, a demon cat. Sango's family was killed and her entire village destroyed by Naraku's demons so Naraku could steal their Shikon Jewel shards. He then blames InuYasha and manipulates Sango into trying to kill him. When the ploy failed, Naraku uses a shard of the Shikon Jewel to revive and control Sango's little brother Kohaku, forcing him to fight InuYasha and company, and using him as a means by which to manipulate Sango. She seeks vengeance against Naraku, but her primary goal is to rescue Kohaku from Naraku's influence and save his life. Sango is often the victim of Miroku's lecherous tendencies, and proceeds to slap him for it. However, she later confesses her love to him and the two get engaged. At the end of the series, Sango and Miroku get married and the two have three children. She also allowed Kirara to join her brother Kohaku and aid him in his demon slaying.   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Hko Kuwashima . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Kelly Sheridan .     [ edit ]   Kirara   Kirara  (    ? )  is Sango's faithful,  demon-cat  companion. Kirara usually appears in the form of a small feline no larger than a kitten with two tails. When necessary, she can transform into full demon with larger saber-teeth, flames around her feet and tail, and at a size large enough to carry 2-3 humans on her back. In her full demon form, Kirara is capable of flying, an ability InuYasha's group find useful for transporting Sango, Miroku, and Shippo when InuYasha is running quickly or jumping to greater heights than they would normally be able to keep up with. For most of the series, Kirara stays primarily with Sango and aids InuYasha's group in battles. At the end of the series as Naraku has been defeated, she chooses to join Kohaku as he trains to become a demon slayer while Sango starts her new life with Miroku and their children.   In the anime series, it is suggested that she was once the companion of Midoriko, who originally created the  Shikon no Tama .   She is voiced by  Tarako  in both the original Japanese and the English dubbed version of the series.     [ edit ]   Shippo   Shippo  (    , Shipp ? )  is an orphaned young  fox demon  whose father was killed by the Thunder Brothers, Hiten and Manten, and the first character in the story to join InuYasha and Kagome in their travels as a group. After his father is killed by the Thunder Brothers, Shippo attempts to steal the Shikon Jewel from Kagome and InuYasha, with the intent to become stronger and avenge his father's death. Though his plans fails, Kagome and InuYasha aid him in fulfilling his revenge after hearing his story. Shippo appears as a young boy with fox legs, feet, ears, and a tail. He can also shape-shift into many different forms, but his forms are temporary, often incomplete and ineffective, and he is usually given away by his telltale tail. His other noteworthy abilities are turning into a large pink flying balloon, illusionary tricks with toys like his giant spinning top attack, weak fox fire magic, and making things multiply. He tends to be naively observant and often makes pointed and cheeky comments directed towards InuYasha, earning him a retaliatory bonk on the head. InuYasha and Kagome serve as older sibling figures to Shippo. Due to his size, Shippo is often seen riding on Kirara or the shoulders of others. His actual age is never stated in the series; according to the official  InuYasha  guide by Rumiko Takahashi, his appearance is intended to be similar to that of a seven year old boy.. [ 10 ]   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kumiko Watanabe . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Jillian Michaels .     [ edit ]   Myoga   Myoga  (    , Myga ? )  is a flea demon who appears randomly and gives InuYasha information on current events, foes, and the shards of the Jewel of Four Souls. He was originally charged with protecting the grave of InuYasha's father, where the Tetsusaiga was hidden. However, he fled when Sesshomaru came to the grave in search of the sword. Myoga also enjoys drinking demon blood, and actually saves InuYasha's life at one point by drinking the venom from a spider demon out of his blood. He often gets slapped by InuYasha and others because he drinks their blood without permission.   Myoga often flees before or during a battle, and the others have recognized as a sign of pending danger. Anywhere he is around is considered a safe area. In the anime series, he is engaged to another flea demon named Shoga, though he continually runs from her to avoid the marriage. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kenichi Ogata . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Paul Dobson .     [ edit ]   Sesshomaru's group     [ edit ]   Sesshomaru   Main article:  Sesshomaru   Sesshomaru  (    , Sesshmaru ? )  is InuYasha's older half-brother. Unlike InuYasha, Sesshomaru is a full-blooded Inu-yokai and is initially very contemptuous of InuYasha for being a half-demon and for consorting with humans. He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three of the manga, he could not defeat Naraku. Takahashi also stated that Sesshomaru has no permanent home, though he rules over the Western Lands. Unlike almost every other sentient demon in the world of InuYasha (aside from those affiliated with his and InuYasha's father in some way), he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel. Initially, Sesshomaru is ruthless and cruel in his pursuit of Tetsusaiga and his dealings with his brother. However, as the series progresses, he begins to undergo a change in his behavior, one largely brought about by the influence of Tenseiga and the human child  Rin . He stops trying to claim or destroy Tetsusaiga, and, while still sometimes hostile in his attitude toward InuYasha, he is sometimes ""helpful"" in his encounters with InuYasha's group. He, like InuYasha and his friends, becomes determined to destroy Naraku after Naraku attempts to manipulate him using Rin as a hostage, and his growing compassion for people such as Kagura and it finally prompts Ttsai to volunteer to reforge Tenseiga and make it able to perform the Meidou Zangetsuha (""dark path of the dawn's moon blast"") attack. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ken Narita . In the English dub, he is voiced by  David Kaye .     [ edit ]   Jaken   Jaken  (    ? )  is a small green  imp -like  ykai  who acts as Sesshomaru's servant. Jaken is not especially powerful but is extremely loyal. Despite his loyalty, Sesshomaru more often than not ignores him. However, Jaken continues to verbally promote the greatness of Sesshomaru in ways that the aristocratic Sesshomaru would never do himself. Sesshomaru once resurrected Jaken with the  Tenseiga  when he was killed by Kaijinbo who was possessed by  Tkijin . Jaken does not engage in battle much. When he does, it's usually a clash with a company of some other strong yokai, and he usually uses a weapon known as the Staff of Two Heads (,  nintj ). In the manga, little is explained about Jaken's past, but in the anime, it is explained that Jaken was once a lord among similar demons. A battle broke out with another ykai tribe. The leader of the larger tribe had Jaken by his neck, when Sesshomaru appeared and told the demon to move for he was blocking Sesshomaru's path. The ykai did not heed him and as soon as Sesshomaru repeated himself he used his poison whip and destroyed the ykai. Jaken, captivated by Sesshomaru's power, felt a need to repay him, and followed him. Sesshomaru told Jaken that if he could use the Staff of Two Heads, then he could become his servant. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Yuichi Nagashima . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Don Brown .     [ edit ]   Rin   Rin  (    ? )  is an orphan girl who finds  Sesshomaru  in the woods after he was badly injured by InuYasha's Wind Scar. Rin's family was killed by bandits, and she lived on the outskirts of her small village, having to fend for herself. Although Sesshomaru snubs her, she visits him regularly and attempts to take care of him. She steals fish from the village for him, only to learn that he doesn't eat human food. The villagers beat her for the theft, and when Sesshomaru idly inquires about her injuries, she is disproportionately happy. She initially appears mute, as she doesn't speak to Sesshomaru. Rather she makes hand gestures and smiles.   Later, the wolf-demon  Koga  chases a thief to the village. After killing the thief, Koga lets his wolves attack and kill the villagers for food. Rin escapes the village and runs through the forest towards Sesshomaru, but she trips along the path. The wolves catch up to her and attack her. Recovered from his wounds, Sesshomaru is leaving when he catches Rin's scent and follows it to her mauled and lifeless body. Remembering her smile, he states that he wishes to test his sword again then uses the Tenseiga to resurrect her. After setting Rin on her feet again, Sesshomaru walks away, leaving the dumbfounded Jaken and a wide-eyed Rin standing on the path. After a moment, they both follow. The next time Rin is seen, she is clean, wearing a new, colorful  kimono , and talking and acting more like a typical child.   Throughout the series, she is generally seen following Sesshomaru, whom she addresses as Lord Sesshomaru, or waiting for him with Ah-Un and sometimes Jaken while Sesshomaru is dealing with more dangerous tasks. Though Sesshomaru never speaks of having any feelings for her, he is shown to have a strong protective instinct, and its clear that Rin is devoted to him. At one time, she and many other children are captured by another demon that is destroyed by a group of monks lead by Ungai. Rin refuses to go with the monks as she knows Sesshomaru is already on his way, but Ungai attempts to force her to come. Rin fights him and calls for Sesshomaru, who reveals that he was indeed already there. The monks are unable to hurt him the same way they destroyed the lesser demons and Rin is freed from Ungai's hold. When she seems to hesitate to leave with him, Sesshomaru tells her to do as she wishes and walks away. She waves goodbye to Ungai and runs after him. Once they rejoin Jaken, Rin spots several graves along the path, and asks Sesshomaru to remember her after she dies. Sesshomaru appears surprised by the question and responds: ""Don't say such silly things."" [ 11 ]   Rin is killed for a second time in the series when she and Kohaku, now also journeying with Sesshomaru, are taken by the ""Dog from Hell."" When he finds her, Sesshomaru is visibly disturbed with a look of disbelief and shock on his face. It is at this point that he learns that Tenseiga can only revive a person once. Rin's lifeless body is taken by the Master of Hell, with Sesshomaru and Kohaku following to take it back. When they return from the Land of the Dead, Sesshomaru's mother uses her Meidou stone to revive Rin. Jaken confirms that it made Sesshomaru happy while Sesshomaru puts his hand on Rin's cheek.   In the final chapter of the manga, set three years after the defeat of Naraku, Rin no longer travels with Sesshomaru and Jaken. Instead, she lives with  Kaede , which InuYasha comments is ""practice"" for her to live in a human village as an adult, or whatever life she chooses. Sesshomaru is shown visiting her and bringing her gifts.   In the anime adaptation, Rin is voiced by  Mamiko Noto . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Brenna O'Brien .     [ edit ]   Ah-Un   Ah-Un  (    , A-Un ? )  is a two-headed dragon demon and  Sesshomaru 's loyal/domesticated beast of burden. He is one of the only two ykai in the series who is explicitly stated to be a  herbivore . Despite the fact that he has traveled with Sesshomaru for centuries, he did not have a name until after Rin gave him one, naming the right head ""Ah,"" and the left head ""Un."" Ah-Un can fire ykai energy from both mouths. The right head can shoot blue beams of lightning, while the left can shoot green lightning that can control clouds and possibly the weather. Also when it flies, a grey cloud-like gas gathers around its legs which is similar to the flaming versions of those around Kirara's.   On their journeys, Rin and Jaken often rest on his back when they are flying over great distances. When Sesshomaru leaves Rin in a safe place, either with Jaken or by herself, Ah-Un stays with her and will act as her protector if she is threatened. He saved Rin from a group of lesser demons when she went to collect an herb to save Jaken, who was dying from being poisoned by Naraku's  Saimysh . Ah-Un also defeated many of  Setsuna no Takemaru 's  zombie  warriors in  InuYasha the Movie 3: Swords of an Honorable Ruler .     [ edit ]   Naraku's group     [ edit ]   Naraku   Main article:  Naraku   Naraku  (    ? )  is the series' primary  antagonist . Naraku is responsible for many of the characters suffering, including the death of Kikyo [ 7 ]  and the sealing of InuYasha to the sacred tree. [ 12 ]  Naraku originated from a bandit named Onigumo, [ 12 ]  who made a deal with several demons in order to receive a new body so he may pursue his caretaker, Kikyo and gain possession of the  Shikon Jewel . [ 13 ]  Throughout the series' run, Naraku has created many detachments, to aid him in goal of killing those who oppose him and finding the shards of the  Shikon Jewel . In the anime adaptation, he is his voiced by  Toshiyuki Morikawa . [ 14 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Paul Dobson . [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Kanna   Kanna  (    ? )  is the first detachment of Naraku. She is a ykai who appears as a girl with white hair and clothing. Kanna carries with her a demonic  mirror , with which she can steal the souls of those reflected in it. Once a soul is trapped within her mirror, Kanna can control their host bodies to carry out her bidding. However, if a powerful soul is locked into the mirror it will overflow it, the mirror will start to crack, forcing Kanna to release all souls currently trapped within, or her mirror will shatter. [ 16 ]  The mirror also has the ability to create a glass demon that can copy the abilities of whatever it reflects, though Kanna receives all damage in the glass demon's stead. Being a ""concealed incarnation"" of Naraku, Kanna has no smell and no demonic aura [ 17 ] . This makes it impossible for InuYasha to detect her and makes her immune to demonic aura-related effects including Hakurei-zan barrier. Kanna is the only incarnation that Naraku trusts, telling her important information about his actions and allowing her to give orders to his other incarnations and pawns. In her last battle, Kanna is ordered by Naraku to commit suicide, shattering herself and the glass demon she was currently using into thousands of tiny shards. One of the shards hits Kagome's right eye, and using it Kanna directs her final thought into telling Kagome how to destroy Naraku.   In the anime adaptation, Kanna's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. She is voiced by  Yukana Nogami . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Janyse Jaud .     [ edit ]   Kagura   Kagura  (    ? )  is a creation of Naraku's, his second ""detachment."" A wind sorceress, Kagura primarily uses a wind-manipulating fan to enhance her powers and create wind-based attacks, including a blade-like tornado attack and using wind to animate dead bodies. She can also use a pair of feathers that she wears in her hair for transportation, enlarging them then using them to ride in the wind.   Kagura hates her creator and wishes to be free from him. To this end, she often opposes him when she feels that Naraku will not notice, including offering aid to both  InuYasha  and  Sesshomaru  in hopes they will kill him. She must exercise caution, however, as he literally holds her heart, threatening to crush it and kill her if she betrays him. At times he has caught her defying him in action, or in thought when she is close enough for him to read her mind, he would squeeze her heart in his hands in front of her causing her to collapse in pain.   When Naraku charges her with guarding Gorymaru at a prison, Hakudshi convinces her to release him so he can destroy Naraku. She also learns that  Kohaku  has regained his memory, and they become allies, sharing information they gather about Naraku's weaknesses. Through this partnership, Kagura becomes protective of Kohaku, leading her to openly defy Naraku. She protects the boy when Hakudshi attempts to take his Shikon shard, which would kill Kohaku instantly. After Naraku kills Hakudshi, Kagura helps Kohaku escape from Naraku who also wants to kill the boy by removing the shard. Naraku mockingly returns her heart before fatally attacking her and leaving her to die. Sesshomaru finds the dying Kagura while tracking Naraku. Though he considers using his sword  Tenseiga  to save her, he realizes that the sword would not be able to revive her. Before dying, Kagura appears to be happy to have seen Sesshomaru again, hinting that she may have had some sort of feelings for him. InuYasha's group also arrives, helpless to do more than watch her body dissolve into the wind, giving her the freedom she always longed for. Afterwards, InuYasha asks Sesshomaru if she suffered. Sesshomaru replies that she was smiling when she died.   In the anime adaptation, Kagura's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. She is voiced by  Izumi Oogami . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Janyse Jaud .     [ edit ]   Kohaku   Kohaku  (    ? )  is Sango's younger brother, who was once under the control of Naraku. When Naraku disguised himself as Kagewaki Hitomi, the son of a lord, he used Lord Hitomi's father to call upon Sango and the demon slayers to slay a false demon. Naraku forced Kohaku to turn against his companions, killing his father and all the demon slayers. Sango survived solely by sheer luck. Castle guards also killed Kohaku that night, only to be later resurrected by Naraku as an amnesiac puppet. After several encounters with Sango and her friends, he began to recover his painful memories and sought to secretly find a way to destroy Naraku while still maintaining the illusion of being under his control; he later formed an alliance with Kagura, who sought freedom from Naraku's tyranny. Following Kagura's death, he joins Kikyo as he believes travelling with her will be the only way to redeem himself. He remains by her side until she tells him to separate from her for fear of being unable to keep his shard pure. However, he is nearly captured by Byakuya, and only a timely arrival by  Sesshomaru  saves him. Kohaku remains with Sesshomaru's group after this, and helps protect Rin, who he has a friendship with. In the last chapter of the manga, Kohaku goes with Kirara along with a new weapon which Totosai made for him. When Totosai asks him if he will visit his sister, Sango, he replies that he will not, since the house it getting too crowded. He then goes off with Kirara to become a better demon slayer. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Akiko Yajima . In the English dub, he is initially voiced by  Alex Doduk , then later by  Danny McKinnon .     [ edit ]   Goshinki   Goshinki  (    ? )  is Naraku's third detachment and takes the form of a large horned purple demon. [ 16 ]  Goshinki has the ability to read the thoughts of others, which enables him to outmaneuver InuYasha. Goshinki breaks the Tetsusaiga by biting it. However, by doing so he caused InuYasha's demon blood to takeover. After which Goshinki was no longer able read his thoughts, resulting in his death at the claws of InuYasha. Sesshomaru, realizing that Goshiki had broken Tetsusaiga, took his fangs and had the sword Tokijin made from them. [ 16 ]  In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Masaharu Sat . [ 18 ]  In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Kopsa . [ 19 ]     [ edit ]   Kageromaru   Kageromaru  (    , Kagermaru ? )  is the fourth detachment, a tiny slithering creature with a human head and two scythed-arms. Despite his form, Kagermaru is revealed to be quite fast, and can also tunnel in the ground. He resides in Juromaru's stomach, who is loyal only to him, where he can make surprise attacks on the enemy. Kageromaru has a love of eating the insides of people and ykai alike. Despite this, Kagermaru is revealed to be quite intelligent, and, unlike Juromaru, is shown being able to talk. He was killed along with his younger brother by InuYasha and Koga.     [ edit ]   Juromaru   Juromaru  (    , Jrmaru ? ) , the fifth incarnation, is perhaps the least loyal of all of the incarnation Naraku creates. Juromaru's only loyalty is his elder brother Kageromaru, who is hidden in Jrmaru's stomach when covered by a metal mask. When first introduced, Juromaru was chained up, possibly because his elder brother attempted to kill Naraku. Jrmaru has little intelligence and never speaks, characterized only by a lust to kill. He and his elder brother were killed by InuYasha and Koga.     [ edit ]   Muso   Muso  (    , Mus ? )  was separated from Naraku in his attempt to remove his human side, Onigumo, which would also remove Onigumo's love for Kikyo. He is the sixth detachment of Naraku. Naraku cared so little for the incarnation he neither named it or gave it a face. Muso took both his name and face from a wandering monk he slew. Muso ventured to Kikyo's former village, where he runs into InuYasha's group, and battles them quickly after their encounter. Soon Naraku quickly realizes, however, that he cannot abandon Onigumo when demons try to gain their freedom from his body, and Muso was absorbed back into Naraku. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hiroshi Yanaka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Brian Dobson .     [ edit ]   The Infant   The Infant  (    , Akago ? )  is Naraku's heart and seventh detachment, and is capable of speaking fluently. He is a baby that can possess anyone with the darkness in their heart. His main goal is to control Kagome's mind by finding the pain, anger, or jealousy within her heart, and use her abilities to find the remaining shards of the Shikon Jewel. He finds her jealousy of InuYasha's feelings for Kikyo, but InuYasha saves her before The Infant can control her. Like  Hakudoshi  and  Kagura , The Infant is not loyal to  Naraku . He is destroyed along with  Moryomaru  by  Naraku . In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ai Kobayashi .     [ edit ]   Hakudoshi   Hakudoshi  (    , Hakudshi ? )  is the eighth detachment from Naraku and created from The Infant's body, he was Entei's final master and takes the form of a young child. Like Naraku, his heart is not inside his body, so he is able to endlessly regenerate himself. Due to being created from The Infant, he is capable of using all of The Infant's abilities, and can regenerate from any damage, as his heart is not in his body, but inside his brother, The Infant. Hakudoshi is able to tame a fire-horse named Entei  (    ? ) , which Hakudoshi used to move from place to place prior to Entei's destruction. Hakudoshi also claims a  naginata  from a pig demon. Hakudoshi uses this to decapitate ogres and use their heads to see into the borderland between the dead and living worlds.   Over time, both The Infant and Hakudoshi grow tired of Naraku's rule over them, and seek to betray and overthrow him. To help The Infant in battle and protect him, Hakudoshi creates Moryomaru. Naraku eventually realized their wish to betray him, however, and Naraku instructs his  Saimyosho  to abandon Hakudoshi in battle, giving him no protection against  Miroku 's Wind Tunnel, and he is destroyed.   In the anime adaptation, Hakudoshi's death is never shown as the series ends before the manga. He is voiced by  Ai Kobayashi . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Chiara Zanni .     [ edit ]   Byakuya   Byakuya  (    ? )  is Naraku's ninth and final detachment, meant to replace Kagura. He is loyal to Naraku and has an incredible power of creating illusions. His main purpose was to observe InuYasha and Mrymaru's growing powers and report these observations back to Naraku, though was never given details about these missions, much like Kagura, and had chosen to stay protective of his own life after witnessing Kanna's death. Byakuya has the power to possess people with paper soldiers, summon vines to entrap his enemies, teleport others to different dimensions, detach  organs  from his body, and erect barriers. He travels on a giant  origami  paper  crane .   After taking the power of one slash of InuYasha's Meidou Zangetsuha, he later slashes Kagome with the blade. However, before he gets a chance at a second strike, InuYasha attacks him with his Meidou Zangetsuha and Byakuya is absorbed into it. When Naraku dies, a Meidou appears behind Kagome, due to Byakuya's Meidou Blade.     [ edit ]   Moryomaru   Moryomaru  (    , Mrymaru ? )  was an enemy of Naraku. He was a 100-foot long monster in a human form who could shoot blasts of energy from his arm. At first, he is merely a life force puppet, the more refined of various such creations made from ykai by Hakudshi, and as such, he had no true personality, soul or will. He is given to Kanna, who places The Infant inside of him, giving Moryomaru Naraku's physical life force. Moryomaru begins to increase more and more in power as he absorbs different  ykai  to gain their abilities. During a battle, he nearly defeats an onslaught of most of Naraku's enemies which included  Kikyo , Kohaku,  Kagome , InuYasha,  Miroku , Sango,  Shippo , and Sesshomaru. He succeeds in breaking Sesshomaru's sword, but flees after nearly losing a shard of the Shikon Jewel. He is killed when he devours Naraku, and Naraku absorbs his power from the inside and uses it to be reborn.     [ edit ]   Princess Abi   Princess Abi is the princess of featherless blood-sucking fire bird yokai and servant to Naraku. Her mother, Queen Tekkei, became ill after she ate a poisoned ykai, which prompted Princess Abi to collect blood for her. After attacking several villages, Naraku had appeared to make a deal with her; he would give her weapons and become his servant in exchange for his blood. Princess Abi eventually attempts to fight with InuYasha, though the battle ends with him leaving her after destroying her shield. Princess Abi grew suspicious of Naraku over time and decides to betray him. To prove she isn't an ally, she attempts to attack The Infant, one of Naraku's offspring. After a quick battle with InuYasha, Princess Abi leaves, finally having enough blood for her mother. However, Naraku decides to reveal his true intent to use Tekkei to get into the border between the worlds of the living and the dead. Tekkei, finally revealing her full form of a giant bird ykai, attacks and swallows Naraku, who responds by decapitating her from the inside. Naraku then kills Princess Abi painlessly, a reward for being useful, and uses Tekkei's blood to create a pathway between the living and dead worlds.     [ edit ]   Band of Seven   The Band of Seven  (    , Shichinintai ? ) , are seven  mercenaries  brought back to life by Naraku using the Shikon Jewel shards. All of their names end in  kotsu   (    ? ) , meaning ""bone"".     [ edit ]   Bankotsu   Bankotsu  (    ? )  is the leader,and the strongest member of the Band of Seven. He is also the youngest of the group. He carries the huge Banryu  halberd . Bankotsu is a skilled mercenary and has killed many people; however, he frequently shows a sense of honor and compassion, though only for his six companions.   After being brought back to life, Bankotsu seeks his weapon, Banryu, and kills everyone in the surrounding area once he succeeds. The scent of blood draws InuYasha's group to him, and Bankotsu engages in battle with them. However, Bankotsu and the Band of Seven are called back by Naraku after InuYasha's Wind Scar nicked Banryu. He took the jewel shards Renkotsu stole from Kagome to repair his damaged blade, giving it the power to deflect the Wind Scar. Later, Bankotsu soon realizes how deceptive Renkotsu has become, killing him when he learned Renkotsu murdered Jakotsu. With 7 fragments in his body and two in his halberd, Bankotsu headed off to destroy InuYasha deep inside Mount Hakurei. In the manga, InuYasha wins slowly cuts the Shikon shards out of his body as the battle progresses until Bankotsu was cut in two, with Naraku stripping the remaining half of its shikon jewel shard. In the anime, Bankotsu slew 1,000 ykai and killed 1,000 warlords with Banryu. Banryu, in turn, transformed into a demonic weapon with the ability to release physical manifestations of its users' hatred in the form of powerful demonic energy. However, this proves to be his downfall as InuYasha takes the opportunity and unleashes the Backlash Wave, crushing Bankotsu and shattering Banry.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Takeshi Kusao . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Matt Hill .     [ edit ]   Renkotsu   Renkotsu  (    ? )  is the second in command and is the third strongest member of the Band of Seven. He became resentful of Bankotsu's power and dares to betray him. After Ginkotsu self-destructed to save Renkotsu from Koga, Renkotsu took Ginkotsu's shard and stuck it in his wounded shoulder. Later, he killed the injured Jakotsu after his battle with InuYasha and took his jewel shard. As punishment for hiding the shards and killing Jakotsu, Bankotsu kills him. Renkotsu was an expert with explosives and metallurgy who used bombs, cannons, wires that will be lit afire, and a special concoction that he drinks to spit fire. He was also a gifted strategist, and possessed some skill at hand to hand combat although the only members of the group he surpassed in fighting skills was Mukotsu and Kyokotsu. He was also skilled at mechanical work, to the point of being able to reconstruct Ginkotsu into a living artillery weapon resembling a modern tank. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Tomokazu Sugita . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Brian Drummond .     [ edit ]   Jakotsu   Jakotsu  (    ? ) , the second strongest of the Band of Seven and the third in command, was close friends with Bankotsu before the group was formed. Bankotsu notes that Jakotsu is the only person he trusts. He fights using a sword called the  Jakotsuto , which has snake-like, retractable blades that make it difficult for an opponent to calculate Jakotsu's next move. Jakotsu engages in a lengthy battle with InuYasha, but loses. With him badly wounded, Renkotsu steals his Shikon Shard, causing him to die. As he dies, Jakotsu said he is happy because he got to fight the battle he wanted and he had fun with his second chance in life. Bankotsu later avenges his friends death by killing Renkotsu. Jakotsu is depicted acting in a  homosexual  manner, claiming to have feelings for InuYasha. However, coupled with his sadism, he basically wants to kill in what he considers to be an affectionate way. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ai Orikasa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Jenn Forgie .     [ edit ]   Suikotsu   Suikotsu  (    ? )  is the fourth strongest of the Band of Seven. Has a  split personality ; ""Doctor Suikotsu"" is good, kind, and respected by villagers and ""Suikotsu of the Band of Seven"" is evil and blood-thirsty. The evil side emerged when he was traumatized by seeing a child killed in front of him. Mount Hakurei's purity tends to favor Doctor Suikotsu, and after transforming into both forms, he emerges back at the village he practiced at without the markings on his face, but still violent and willing to kill. He was soon beaten by both Sesshomaru and Kikyo's sacred arrow when he used Rin as a hostage, and, after explaining how he had overcome his double personality, asked Kikyo to remove the Shikon Jewel shard from his neck and let him die peacefully. Respecting his wishes, Kikyo reached to retrieve the jewel, but was stopped as Jakotsu removed it himself and took it to Bankotsu. Suikotsu uses iron claws with exceptionally long blades as weapon. He also possesses phenomenal strength, agility, and savage combat skills due to his unique form of mania and bloodlust. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hiroaki Hirata . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Donovan .     [ edit ]   Ginkotsu   Ginkotsu  (    ? )  has metal parts on his body and various amounts of weaponry within and is the fifth strongest of the Band of Seven. His speech is rarely intelligible, only changing when angered. He barely survives his first encounter with InuYasha and is reconstructed into a siege tank with spider-like legs by Renkotsu. Later, he fought Koga with Renkotsu. In the manga, he exploded when Koga had stuffed pieces of Renkotsu's armor into his cannons, causing them to backfire. In the anime, he survived this attack, but went berserk when Renkotsu received a heavy wound to his left shoulder, causing Ginkotsu to unleash every weapon he had on Koga to no avail. Ginkotsu then self-destructed in an explosion while shielding Renkotsu with his own jewel shard in an effort to save Renkotsu's life.   While in his more human form, he carries a  katana , an axe attached with a chain, a spear, ""steel"" wires, a grappler that replaced his left arm, disk-blades, a cannon on his shoulder, and a drill in his chest. In his tank form, his offense is two main cannons along with the ""steel"" wires. For movement, he has spider-like legs along with disk-blade wheels. In the anime, his additional weapons include a larger array of firearms, as well as launching his main body off like a rocket, which contains wire launchers and a flamethrower. His final weapon is a self-destruct mechanism.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hisao Egawa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Mark Gibbon .     [ edit ]   Mukotsu   Mukotsu  (    ? )  is a short poison master and is the sixth strongest of the Band of Seven. He abducts Kagome and, in the anime, tries to have a wedding ceremony with her but becomes angry at her due to her reaction to his facial features, and tries to kill her when she tries to remove his Shikon Jewel shard. However, in the manga, Mukotsu tries to come onto Kagome until she stabs him, and soon after Miroku and Sango appear. Mukotsu poisons Kagome, Miroku, and Sango, nearly killing them, but was soon killed by Sesshomaru, on whom his poisons have no effect. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Tetsu Inada . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Trevor Devall .     [ edit ]   Kyokotsu   Kyokotsu  (    ? )  is a giant, large and slow witted. He is the largest, but weakest of the Band of Seven. His size is his weapon, and proves to be a formidable foe. Against Koga, Kyokotsu also used a giant iron ball attached to a long chain like a flail-like weapon, which proved to be of little use due to Koga's speed. He terrorized ykai-wolf tribes, who were defenseless before his size and invulnerability. Despite his massive size and fearsome looks, Kyokotsu is human. Kyokotsu is defeated when, while holding Kga with his hand near his face Koga takes the jewel shard from his forehead, instantly killing him. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Daisuke Gri . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Mark Gibbon     [ edit ]   Supporting characters     [ edit ]   Kaede   Kaede  (    ? )  is Kikyo's younger sister. As a child, Kaede accompanied Kikyo as she worked, helping her with various tasks such as gathering herbs or holding her arrows. After her sister's death, Kaede became a miko in her own right and defends the village against  demons . When  Kagome  arrives, Kaede recognizes her as the reincarnation of Kikyo. After Kagome free's InuYasha, Kaede uses her abilities to puts the ""Beads of Subjugation"" on him to give Kagome the power to control him with a spoken word. She often shares advice and knowledge about demons and other spiritual anomalies with InuYasha's group. Kaede is well-respected and held in high regards by the villagers and the members of InuYasha's group. Though InuYasha is easily annoyed with her, he listens to her when necessary and doesn't hesitate to protect her from a threat.   Kaede is shown as having lost an eye sometime during her life. In the manga, it is never stated how this happened. In the anime adaptation, it is said that she lost it during a demon attack on the village.   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Hisako Kyoda . In the Viz English dub, she is voiced by  Pam Hyatt  who depicts her with an archaic tone and vocabulary, such as using "" ye "" even extra-grammatically as an  accusative  and  dative .     [ edit ]   Totosai   Totosai  (    , Ttsai ? )  is an elderly blacksmith ykai and an old friend of  InuYasha and Sesshomaru's father . He spends most of his time at his forge, located within a volcano, where he works to create and repair his customer's swords. When he goes out, he travels on a flying three eyed ox named M-M. He forged both Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga, the swords which belong to  InuYasha  and  Sesshomaru , respectively. Their father entrusted him to help his two sons master their respective swords. As the series progresses, he strengthens both swords as InuYasha grows stronger and Sesshomaru grows more compassionate, the requirements needed for each to be considered more capable of handling the blades.   Much to InuYasha's annoyance, Totosai is often absent-minded and will abruptly forget what is happening, even in the middle of a battle. He occasionally scolds with InuYasha on how he uses Tetsusaiga, lamenting that his sword is in the hands of someone he feels is so unworthy. His complains have helped annoy InuYasha enough to help him increase in power.   Though Totosai often acts like a cowardly old man, he is capable of breathing fire and wields a giant forging hammer. His hammer can open large fire pits when stuck on the ground, and he has been shown to be strong enough to pause an attack from Sesshomaru long enough to allow InuYasha to get away. At the end of the series, he allows Kohaku to work for him.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Jji Yanami . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Richard Newman .     [ edit ]   Hachiemon   Hachiemon  (    ? )  is a  tanuki , who goes by the nickname  Hachi . Hachi calls Miroku ""Master"" and is willing to do what Miroku asks. In the anime, he once took the form of Miroku to sell fake seals and exorcisms and have his way with the ladies. The eventual result was that while Hachi was being assaulted by a weasle demon, Miroku intervened and saved Hachie from the demon. Hachi sometimes acts as the transportation for InuYasha's group by transforming into a large yellow  blimp -like creature. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Toshihiko Nakajima . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Terry Klassen .     [ edit ]   Kikyo   Main article:  Kikyo   Kikyo  (    , Kiky ? )  is a powerful shrine maiden who loved InuYasha and was killed by Naraku (disguised as InuYasha), who made the two fight fifty years before the start of the story. She is brought back to life by the ogress Urasue, using soil from her grave and a part of Kagome's soul. Although she looks alive, her body is still ""dead,"" and she must ingest the souls of dead women in order to move. Her body is made of clay and graveyard soil and is considered a ""clay doll."" Although she is initially driven by hate, trying to drag InuYasha to hell and to kill Kagome, her village considers her a heroine, and Kikyo gradually returns to the love-motivated and caring personality she possessed while alive. However, once she discovered the truth about how Naraku killed her, she wanted revenge on Naraku. In episode 14 of the anime, InuYasha admits that he would go to hell for/with Kikyo. In the manga, Naraku kills her and she dies in the arms of InuYasha. In the latter chapters of the manga, she and  Kohaku  work together; she protects Kohaku and saves his life. She dies in InuYasha's arms after being attacked by Naraku. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Noriko Hidaka . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Willow Johnson       From left to right Hakkaku, Koga, and Ginta.         [ edit ]   Koga   Koga  (    , Kga ? )  is the young leader of the southern ykai-wolf tribe, who wishes to avenge his fallen comrades who were slaughtered by Kagura, one of Naraku's minions. While brash and arrogant, he is shrewd enough to run from a fight if he thinks he cannot win. He had three Shikon jewel shards, one in each of his legs and one in his right arm, which gave him increased speed and strength. He soon lost the shard in his arm in his fight with Kagura after she slayed his companions and lost the other two in a fight with Naraku later in the manga. He is first battled by InuYasha, after allowing his pack to eat villagers, (including Sesshomaru's friend Rin) though Koga retreats after sensing that InuYasha would use his Wind Scar. Although he bickers with InuYasha constantly, one will help when the other is in danger. Koga courts Kagome, protects her whenever possible, and professes love to, which irritates InuYasha, though Kagome doesn't share his affections. Later, his entire pack, with the exception of Ginta and Hakkaku, are destroyed by Naraku. Koga vows to destroy Naraku after this he is joined by two young wolf demons in the manga who leave with Hakkakku and Ginta when he sends them away. After losing the jewel shards in his legs he leaves and disappears from the manga, but first he tells Kagome that she may leave InuYasha and come to him if she ever feels the need. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Taiki Matsuno . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Scott McNeil .     [ edit ]   Ginta   Ginta  (    ? )  is one of Koga's followers.

Long ago, during the night of the lunar rainbow, Koga made a promise to marry her. Yet he fails to fulfill his promise. When Ayame comes to get Koga, he states that he is going to marry Kagome. She has red hair that is always in two ponytails with an iris in it, and her eyes are green. Her clothing consists of white wolf fur draped over her shoulders, a necklace, and armor that is red and blue. She is only seen in the anime, and is not present in the manga. In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Yumi Kakazu . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Natalie Walters .     [ edit ]   Minor characters     [ edit ]   The Great Dog Demon   The Great Dog Demon  (    , Inu no Taish ? )  was a powerful  ykai  lord who was known throughout Japan. He fathered both  Sesshomaru  with another dog demon who appears in the manga and  InuYasha  with a human woman, Izayoi. He is never formally addressed with a name. The Great Dog Demon was first mentioned in chapter 12 of the manga, revealing that he was InuYasha's father and ""a demon dog that prowled the lands of the west"". Sesshomaru, the eldest son, was searching for the heirloom sword Tetsusaiga, which was supposed to be enshrined in his father's tomb. However, the gateway to the tomb had been hidden in a black pearl in InuYasha's right eye. The black pearl was a mystical gem that the Great Dog Demon obtained from  Hosenki  in order to create a path to where he hid his grave, in the boundary between the mortal world and the next. However, the origin of the pearl and the precise location of the grave were not revealed until much later in the story, chapters 298 and 297, respectively. The Great Dog Demon's tomb was first depicted in chapter 15, and was in the form of an enormous dog skeleton adorned in a suit of armor.  Myga  revealed that the Great Dog Demon had died with a considerable number of years behind him, and that he was now displayed as his true form free of any transformation. Within the skeleton was entombed the sword Tetsusaiga, forged from the Great Dog Demon's own fang. However, the sword had a barrier on it that prevented any non-human that has malevolence towards humans from touching it, which prevented Sesshomaru from claiming the sword as his own. Tetsusaiga also had the property of being unable to unleash its true power unless it was done for the benefit of humans. Because of these qualities, it was InuYasha who inherited the sword rather than Sesshomaru, after Kagome had pulled the sword from its resting place. Its sheath has a barrier of its own that can protect the one holding it from almost any attack.   The Great Dog Demon's major foe in the manga was the dragon  Rykotsusei . He could not completely kill Rykotsusei, and was only able to seal him to a cliff face with his claw before he died. The manga makes no mention of precisely how quickly the Great Dog Demon died following this altercation, but Myga called the battle the ""cause"" of his death. In the third  InuYasha  film,  InuYasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler , the Great Dog Demon survived long enough to save Izayoi and their newborn child InuYasha. He was still weak from his battle with Ryukotsusei, but put protecting the  laboring  Izayoi above all else and recklessly rushed into battle, which caused his demise. Another foe in the manga is the ykai Shishinki. Shishinki was the originator of the Meidou Zangetsuha technique, which the Great Dog Demon stole from him using Tetsusaiga's ability to absorb a defeated enemy's powers. Shishinki was left for dead, having been dealt a blow that took off the entire left side of his head, but he survived and returned to challenge Sesshomaru later.   In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Akio Otsuka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Don Brown .     [ edit ]   InuYasha's mother   InuYasha's mother, who is never named in the manga nor the anime adaptation, is primarily seen through flashbacks, as she was already dead at the start of the series. The daughter of a feudal lord, she is depicted as being a gentle, beautiful woman who loved InuYasha's father. She is also shown expressing sorrow for a young InuYasha over his being shunned by other children because of his half-demon status. Little is revealed about her family, age, or even how she died, with InuYasha only noting that she died ""a long time ago"" and that her manner of death ""wasn't her fault."" Upon her death, InuYasha was left with the Robe of the Fire Rat, which his father had given his mother to protect her on the night InuYasha was born, and a shell containing his mother's favorite lip coloring which he gave to Kikyo. [ 20 ] [ 21 ]   In the anime adaptation, she is voiced by  Kikuko Inoue . In the English dub, she is voiced by  Alaina Burnett . The third  InuYasha  film,  InuYasha the Movie: Swords of an Honorable Ruler , which is not directly based on the manga, gives InuYasha's mother the name  Izayoi   (    ? ) . The film also creates a history for her, showing her being guarded in a castle by Setsuna no Takemaru and his samurai on the night of InuYasha's birth who wish to kill the Great Dog Demon, knowing he would come for her. Izayoi pleads with Takemaru to leave, knowing the Great Dog Demon would kill him, but Takemaru claims he loves her, then fatally stabs her in the chest with a spear. Before she dies, she is able to give birth to InuYasha. The Great Dog Demon, already injured by his battle with  Rykotsusei , fights his way through Takemaru's men and the burning building to reach his dead lover and his newborn child. He uses the  Tenseiga  sword to save her life then covers her with the Robe of the Fire Rat and orders her to flee. Before she leaves, he names his son InuYasha. The Great Dog Demon remained behind to fight Takemaru to the death as Izayoi fled with their child.     [ edit ]   Ryukotsusei   Ryukotsusei  (    , Rykotsusei ? )  is a giant dragon daiykai who fought InuYasha's father, the Great Dog Demon. Though he wasn't killed, Ryukotsusei was sealed away with one of his claws. However, the wounds the Great Dog Demon received from the battle caused him to die shortly after. Following Ttsai's explanation,  InuYasha  stubbornly went to fight Ryukotsusei so that Tetsusaiga, his sword, would become lighter and easier to use again. Myga informs InuYasha that since the dragon is already sealed, all he must do is stab the dragon in the heart to kill it and ""surpass his father"". However, InuYasha complains that this is not his style and would prefer to fight the dragon head on. InuYasha has his wish fulfilled when  Naraku  removes his father's seal so that the dragon would awaken to destroy InuYasha. Ryukotsusei has an incredible armored hide that is nearly impenetrable and his power level is also high enough so that when he fired a blast from his mouth,  Miroku 's wind tunnel was unable to absorb the attack and only slightly changed its trajectory away from InuYasha. Ryukotsusei is ruthless and has a mask that exists on his forehead through which he speaks. His attack is Thunder Attack Bullet, a giant white ball of explosive energy, which he emits from his mouth, and could easily have defeated InuYasha if not for InuYasha learning the Backlash Wave just in time to defeat the dragon.   Ryukotsusei is seen in the second ending,  Fukai Mori , when Sesshomaru visits where he was sealed. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Kazuhiko Inoue . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Trevor Devall .     [ edit ]   Hakushin   Hakushin  (    ? )  was once a great monk that helped people during a famine. When he became sick and was dying, the people buried him alive on an island called Hijiri so that he could become a "" living Buddha "". He was unable to give up his attachment to live to achieve full Buddha-hood.  Naraku  found him on Hijiri and revives him into a living mummy. Naraku convinces Hakushin that he hated those who buried him and to help him by erecting a barrier around Mount Hakurei that purifies every creature that has supernatural or demonic powers and prevents people from acting on impure or evil thoughts. The barrier causes InuYasha to change into his human form, prevents Miroku from groping women, slightly slows Sesshomaru's speed, and greatly weakens Kikyo. After hearing the story of Hakushin, Miroku and Sango search the mountain and find him, but are unable to convinces nor force him to remove the barrier. Hakushin later runs into Kikyo, who is able to persuade him to remove the barrier and pass on to death so he could find peace. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Fumio Matsuoka . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Hiro Kanagawa .     [ edit ]   Hosenki   Hosenki  (    , Hsenki ? )  is an oyster-demon who cultivates a variety of magical jewels. He created the black pearl in  InuYasha 's right eye that enabled Sesshomaru to travel to his father's grave and try to steal Tetsusaiga, the sword his father willed to InuYasha. Later in the series, InuYasha's group needs to travel to the nether world and seek out Hosenki, but learn he has died and his son, who shares his name, can not make the gems yet. They find another path to the world where they find the departed Hosenki sitting among the bone's of InuYasha's father's body. However, he had been corrupted by a corrupted shard of the Shikon Jewel and attacked InuYasha. After Naraku reclaimed his shard, Hosenki returned to normal and taught InuYasha how to use Tetsusaiga's  Adamant Barrage  attack. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Ryzabur tomo . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Dave Pettitt .     [ edit ]   Jinenji   Jinenji   (    ? )  is a half-human, half-horse demon who lives in a hut with his human mother. Together they grow a variety of medicinal plants, including some known for being powerful against poisons. He is first seen when Kirara is poisoned by Naraku's  shki  and Kagome and InuYasha travel to the village to find a cure. When they find him, they also help to clear his name as he was being falsely blamed for people's deaths in the village purely because of his demon blood. Jinenji is depicted as a gentle giant who is initially scared of humans because of the way the villagers treat him. Upon meeting Kagome, he is surprised to find that she is not frightened by his appearance at all and willingly helps him collect herbs. InuYasha, having also dealt with abuse at the hands of humans when he was a child, attempts to convince Jinenji that he needs to be more forceful towards the villagers, especially after he rescues them from a demon. In the end, Jinenji decides to continue his more gentle approach, giving the men injured during the demon attack the herbs they need to heal themselves. Like InuYasha, Jinenji becomes fully human one day a month. During one of these times, Rin visits his home searching for the same cure to heal Jaken, who was poisoned by the wasps while protecting her. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Hisao Egawa . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Michael Dobson .     [ edit ]   Magatsuhi   Magatsuhi  (    ? )  is the ykai who killed Midoriko and whose soul with whom she continuously battles inside the jewel. Like Naraku, Magatsuhi was created by a corrupt human who lusted after a priestess and allowed his body to be consumed by ykai. However, unlike Naraku, who retains a humanoid form, Magatsuhi's true form is much more monstrous. Magatsuhi is first seen in manga chapter 89 as the mummified corpse of an unnamed but massive demon. Later in the manga, the demon's name is revealed to be Magatsuhi, and it is able to (temporarily) escape the jewel and create a humanoid body out of some of Naraku's spare parts. However, this body was soon destroyed by Sesshomaru and InuYasha. In chapter 555 in the manga, InuYasha saw Magatsuhi combating Midoriko inside the Shikon Jewel.   Magatsuhi states that if Kagome were to make a selfish wish on the Jewel, Kagome would replace Midoriko in the eternal fight and Naraku would replace Magatsuhi. InuYasha refuses to believe Magatsuhi, and proceeds to attack it in an attempt to reach Kagome. In the end he and Naraku were destroyed forever by InuYasha when he cuts the point of light in the darkness inside the Shikon Jewel with the Meidou Zangetsuha and arrives in the meidou outside the jewel to save Kagome. Then Kagome makes the right wish; the wish that would exterminate the jewel from the world forever; the wish for the Shikon no Tama to disappear. The jewel breaks; disappears, and InuYasha and Kagome are transported back to earthen ground.     [ edit ]   Midoriko   Midoriko  (    ? )  is a shrine maiden of great spiritual power from many centuries before the  Sengoku period . She had the power to destroy demons by purifying their souls, and was considered the most powerful living human alive in her time. During this time, Kirara was her companion. During a battle with a powerful group of demons, she tired and was unable to purify a fierce demon's soul that she had seized. As she neared death in battle, she thrust forth her soul from her body, and by taking and enveloping the souls of the demon with which she battled, the sacred jewel was formed. Her soul remained locked in battle with the ykai's soul inside the Shikon Jewel until Naraku killed her with Magatsuhi's wish.     [ edit ]   Mushin   Mushin  (    ? )  is the lecherous monk who took care of young Miroku when his father died as a result of the Wind Tunnel curse. Miroku got his lecherous tendencies from his caretaker. Mushin was once possessed by a Urn Grub and almost killed Miroku. Mushin resides in a shrine next to the grave of Miroku's father. In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by  Yuzuru Fujimoto . In the English dub, he is voiced by  Alec Willows .     [ edit ]   Tsubaki   Tsubaki  (    ? )  is a dark shrine maiden who made a deal with a demon to retain her youth and beauty. In her youth, she was Kikyo's rival and sees her chance at revenge when she encounters Kagome. She met her end when Naraku lured her to do his bidding with the almost complete Shikon no Tama and she underestimated Kagome's abilities. She appeared in anime only episodes 6064 as the Dark Priestess ().     [ edit ]   References       ^  a   b   c   Takahashi, Rumiko (1998). ""Chapter 01"".  InuYasha, Volume 1 . Viz Media.

Kagome Higurashi       InuYasha  character         Kagome portrayed in the anime       First appearance   "" The Girl Who Overcame Time... and the Boy Who Was Just Overcome ""       Created by   Rumiko Takahashi       Voiced by   Satsuki Yukino  (Japanese)   Moneca Stori  (English)       Profile       Age   15 [ 1 ]       Species   Human       Known relatives   Grandfather  Mother  Sota Higurashi (brother)       Weapon   Bow and arrow (sacred arrows)  Spiritual powers (reiki)       Kagome Higurashi   (     , Higurashi Kagome ? )  is a  fictional character  and one of the  protagonists  in the  anime  and  manga  series  InuYasha , created by  Rumiko Takahashi .     [ edit ]   Overview   Kagome is a young girl of this manga and anime series. Her grandfather is the keeper of the Higurashi shrine which is a Shinto shrine near Tokyo. On her fifteenth birthday, Kagome tries to save her cat from falling down the shrine well and she is pulled into the Bone Eater's well by Mistress Centipede. This takes her back into time to the Warring States Period (Sengoku Jidai) of Japan, where she finds the half demon whose name is InuYasha.     [ edit ]   Powers and abilities     Purification Powers    This ability means anything Kagome touches gets purified. By gathering an enormous amount of concentrated power into her right palm, she can direct it at her opponents. [ 2 ]  She also uses this to purify the Jewel.       Spiritual Powers    Kagome can pass through barriers, spells, and/or illusions. Kagome is also able to sense evil auras and is unaffected by them. If possible, she is able to surround herself with her own spiritual powers to ward off any evil. It is later revealed that her powers are, to a great extent, sealed by the  Shikon no Tama , so she may have other powers than these.  [ 3 ]  According to Rumiko Takahashi, Kagome is potentially much stronger than Kikyo herself. Because Kagome is the reincarnation of Kikyo, Kagome most likely has Kikyo's power to add to her own. [ citation needed ]  In chapter 539 of the manga, when Magatsuhi was killed by Sesshoumaru, the complete extent of Kagome's spiritual powers were released.   Shikon Jewel Detecting    This allows her to sense the exact location of the Shikon Jewel shards. While other characters have shown a vague ability to see Shikon shards, only Kagome and Kikyo are able to sense the shards remotely.       Time Travel    Kagome can travel back and forth 500 years between the present and the Feudal era using the magical well behind her family's shrine. [ 4 ]  InuYasha and Kagome seem to be the only two characters in the series who are capable of doing so.       In the final chapters of the series, after the destruction of the Shikon Jewel, the well appears to temporarily shut down for three years. Kagome attempts to go back in time regularly, but is unsuccessful. However, after her high school graduation, she successfully time travels through the well.       Beads of Subjugation (Sit)   Placed around InuYasha's neck by Kaede and empowered to ""subdue"" him at a word from Kagome. This slams InuYasha into the ground whenever she says the words ""sit"". The effect wears off quickly and InuYasha is able to get up again.       Kyd  (lit. Way of the Bow)   Kagome uses a basic bow as a weapon. Once she infuses her powers into the bow, she can use it to reflect an enemy's attack. Kagome uses a  shortbow . This changes when later on in the manga, she locates a  longbow  with special spiritual powers. [ 5 ]  It has the power to strike evil spirits or the user's intended target bypassing others, if the opponent should happen to be using a hostage as a shield, the arrow will bypass the hostage and hit the enemy instead, only by using this particular bow. [ 6 ]   Sacred Arrow   Kagome infuses her powers into her arrows. This allows the arrows to penetrate demonic forces and to purify objects.   Sacred Backlash Wave   This attack is actually a combined effort between InuYasha and Kagome. [ 7 ]  It consists of Kagome firing one of her Sacred Arrows into the center of InuYasha's Backlash Wave before it connects. When it hits the enemy there is a higher chance that he will be destroyed by the combined powers.       [ edit ]   Notes and references       ^  Zusetsutaizan Ougikaiden By Rumiko Takahashi   ^  Note: She only does this when the Shikon jewel is inside her body.   ^  First revealed in Vol. 52, Chapter 511   ^  Note: In the first part of the anime, Kagome seems to be only able to time travel when she has a Shikon Jewel shard with her or is with InuYasha. However, this restriction does not apply in the manga. Later on in the anime, this restriction is dropped and ignored.   ^  Received in Vol. 46, chapters 457-458   ^  Ability discovered in Vol. 52, chapter 511   ^  Note: This has been used only in the movies and in episode 140 of the anime.                       v      d      e     InuYasha  by  Rumiko Takahashi             Franchise     Chapters    Episodes  (Season  1     2     3     4     5     6 )               Films     Affections Touching Across Time    Castle Beyond the Looking Glass    Swords of an Honorable Ruler    Fire on the Mystic Island               Games     A Feudal Fairy Tale    Feudal Combat    The Secret of the Cursed Mask    Secret of the Divine Jewel               Characters     InuYasha    Kagome Higurashi    Sesshomaru    Naraku    Kikyo                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagome_Higurashi ""      Categories :  InuYasha characters  |  Fictional archers  |  Fictional priests and priestesses Hidden categories:  Articles lacking reliable references from January 2009  |  Wikipedia articles with plot summary needing attention from January 2009  |  Articles with topics of unclear notability from January 2009  |  Cleanup from January 2009  |  Wikipedia introduction cleanup  |  Articles that need to differentiate between fact and fiction  |  Articles containing Japanese language text  |  All articles with unsourced statements  |  Articles with unsourced statements since January 2008                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Catal       Espaol              Magyar              Portugus       Romn       Suomi       Ting Vit                                                           This page was last modified on 27 February 2009, at 12:53.

InuYasha desires the gem in order to turn himself into a full blooded demon. InuYasha does not get far before  Kikyo , the young  miko  of the village, shoots him with a sacred arrow that indefinitely seals him onto Goshinboku, a sacred tree in the nearby forest. After being mortally wounded, Kikyo tells her younger sister,  Kaede , to burn the jewel with her body to prevent it from falling into the hands of evil.   In modern Tokyo, a junior high school girl named  Kagome Higurashi  is on her way to school. She stops in the well house of her family's  Shinto  shrine to retrieve her cat, Buyo, when a centipede demon emerges from the well and pulls her into the  Sengoku period  of Japan.   Not knowing where she is, Kagome wanders around a forest near the Bone Eater's Well. She spots Goshinboku off in the distance and proceeds towards it. On the tree, she finds InuYasha, who is still sealed in an enchanted sleep. Villagers seize her and take her to the old priestess, Kaede. Recognizing that Kagome is the reincarnation of her sister Kikyo, Kaede tells her the story of Kikyo and InuYasha.   The centipede attacks again, and Kagome is forced to release InuYasha from his enchantment so he can kill it. After defeating the centipede, InuYasha tries to take the Jewel of Four Souls from Kagome. In order to thwart InuYasha and to save Kagome's life, Kaede places magical prayer beads around InuYasha's neck so that Kagome can subdue him.   The Jewel of Four Souls attracts more demons, and in a battle against a carrion crow demon, the jewel is shattered into numerous shards that spread all across Japan. As the individual shards are capable of granting those who embed it in their bodies with great power, it is sought after by many demons as well as some humans.   Kagome and InuYasha set out to collect the shards and restore the Jewel of Four Souls. Along the way, they befriend  Shippo , a fox demon;  Miroku , a cursed monk; and  Sango , a demon-slayer whose brother was possessed and forced to slaughter their father and the other demon slayers. The group encounters many friends and foes during the adventure, including InuYasha's older half-brother  Sesshomaru ; Kikyo, who died 50 years ago but, was resurrected with part of Kagome's soul;  Naraku , who tricked Kikyo and InuYasha into turning against each other; and a wolf demon named  Koga , who is in love with Kagome and whenever he and InuYasha meet they constantly bicker.   Eventually, the Shikon jewel is reassembled by Naraku, who is then defeated by InuYasha. Before he dies, Naraku makes a wish on the jewel that Kagome would replace the soul of Midoriko, the jewel's original creator, within the jewel and that his soul would also enter the jewel so he could survive inside as her enemy. This would only work if Kagome made a selfish wish, which Naraku tries to trick her into doing, but confident that InuYasha would rescue her, she refuses to do so. InuYasha rescues her and Kagome wishes for the jewel to disappear forever.   Kagome is thrown back into her own time, and InuYasha is no longer able to see her. However, after three years when Kagome has graduated high school, a portal opens allowing her to return to InuYasha's time. They acknowledge their love for one another and she chooses to remain in the past with him.     [ edit ]   Characters   Main article:  List of InuYasha characters     Kagome Higurashi   (     , Higurashi Kagome ? )   Voiced by:   Satsuki Yukino  (Japanese),  Moneca Stori  (English)   Kagome is a fifteen-year-old ninth grade student. She is the reincarnation of  Kikyo , a  miko  (priestess) who died fifty years before the time Kagome first emerged from the Bone Eater's Well in the  Sengoku period . Because of this, Kagome has powerful spiritual powers and can sense the shards of the Shikon Jewel, an item that is said to balance the forces of good and evil, and resembles Kikyo. Later in the series, she admits that she loves InuYasha, which is also shown when she stays with him at the end of the series.       InuYasha   (    ? )   Voiced by:   Kappei Yamaguchi  (Japanese),  Richard Ian Cox  (English)   InuYasha is a  hany  (half-demon), the product of an inu-ykai  (    ? , dog demon)  and a human. He wields Tetsusaiga, a supernatural sword made from one of his deceased father's fangs. When properly wielded, the sword can destroy one hundred demons with a single swing. InuYasha can quickly recover from injuries that would be fatal to a human, largely due to his demonic blood. During the first night of each  lunar month  ( new moon ), InuYasha changes into a normal human with black hair and black eyes and loses his demonic powers. InuYasha was bound to Goshinboku by  Kikyo 's arrow for fifty years until  Kagome  freed him. InuYasha wears a special bead necklace that forces him to respond to Kagome's command ""Osuwari!"", which translates to ""Sit!"" in English. In the English-dubbed version, ""InuYasha, sit!"" or ""Sit, boy!"" are sometimes used instead. Following the command, InuYasha is thrown to the ground. Kaede had placed the necklace upon InuYasha because he had threatened to kill Kagome if she refused to give the Jewel of Four Souls to him. [ 2 ]  As the series goes on, he begins to like Kagome more and more, shown when he will leave a battle to save her from being hurt.       Miroku   (    ? )   Voiced by:   Kji Tsujitani  (Japanese),  Kirby Morrow  (English)   Miroku is a Buddhist  hshi  (low-ranking, itinerant monk) who travels the countryside performing services such as  exorcisms  and ykai exterminations to earn his living. He suffers from a  hereditary  curse originally inflicted upon his grandfather Miyatsu (also a Buddhist monk) by Naraku. The curse created a hole in his hand that became a  kazaana   (    ? , air void or ""wind tunnel"")  that sucks in anything that is not nailed down, regardless of its mass. However, absorbing poisons or sharp objects harms him and can decrease his total life-span, a fact Naraku takes advantage of by creating highly poisonous insects whose presence prevents Miroku from using his kazna on Naraku or his allies. Miroku uses the kazna as a powerful weapon against ykai, but if the curse is not broken (by defeating Naraku), it will grow too large to control and will consume Miroku himself. Miroku is a talented con artist who does not hesitate to invent fictitious supernatural menaces, which he can then offer to combat in return for food and shelter. He has a distinct weakness for single women. He makes a point of asking every attractive woman he meets if she will bear his child, and he habitually strokes the buttocks of attractive women. Miroku eventually proposes to Sango, though this does little to curb his flirtations with other women. At the end of the series, they are married with three children.       Sango   (    ? )   Voiced by:   Houko Kuwashima  (Japanese),  Kelly Sheridan  (English)   Sango is a serious  ykai taijiya  (demon slayer) who hails from a village of professional demon slayers. Sango wields the Hiraikotsu, a massive  boomerang  made of ykai bones, and uses a broad repertoire of tools and tricks to battle ykai. Sango seeks revenge against Naraku for the death of her family and her entire village. In addition, Sango seeks to rescue her brother Kohaku from Naraku's influence and somehow save his life, even though Kohaku's life is tied to the jewel shard embedded in his back. She eventually develops romantic feelings for Miroku. Despite the fact that everyone, even InuYasha, notices her interest, she refuses to admit it exists. The manifestation of her interest often takes the form of hitting Miroku when he flirts with other single women. Miroku eventually returns her feelings and proposes to her. At the end of the series, they are married with three children.       Shippo   (    , Shipp ? )   Voiced by:   Kumiko Watanabe  (Japanese),  Jillian Michaels  (English)   Shippo is a young orphan  kitsune  (fox demon) whose father was killed by the Thunder Brothers, Hiten and Manten, and the first character in the story to join InuYasha and Kagome in their travels. Shippo can shape shift, but his forms are temporary and often incomplete and ineffective, such that he is usually given away by his tail. His other noteworthy abilities are using illusionary tricks with toys like his giant spinning top attack, using his race's notable foxfire magic, and duplicating things, such as leaves or his own body. He tends to be naively observant and often makes pointed and cheeky comments directed towards InuYasha, earning him a retaliatory rap on the head for his unsolicited ""advice"".       Kirara   (    ? )   Voiced by:   Tarako   Kirara is Sango's faithful  nekomata . She has  cream-colored  fur, black ears, two black stripes on each of her two bushy tails near the tip, and black-tipped paws. Kirara can change between two forms: a ferocious lion-sized ykai with the ability to fly, and a cute kitten. Sango, Miroku, and Shippo often use Kirara's flying ability as transportation in order to keep up with InuYasha. (In the English dub, her name is pronounced ""Kee-Lah-Lah"", because the  Japanese language  treats ""r"" and ""l"" as one  phoneme .)       Sesshomaru   (    , Sesshmaru ? )   Voiced by:   Ken Narita  (Japanese),  David Kaye  (English)   Sesshomaru is the ykai son of the powerful Inu no Taishou and InuYasha's half-brother. Sesshomaru believes that struggle is the only way to survive, and throughout most of the series, he shows his contempt for InuYasha. Although Sesshomaru inherited his father's  Tenseiga , which can bring a hundred people back to life with a single swing, he originally coveted InuYasha's inheritance, a powerful sword. However, a spell was cast on the sword so that a full ykai cannot touch it without burning his flesh. Despite knowing that he cannot touch the sword, Sesshomaru still desires to take it from InuYasha. Throughout the series, Sesshomaru's compassion gradually grows as his rivalry with InuYasha decreases.       Naraku   (    ? ) Voiced by:   Toshiyuki Morikawa  (Japanese),  Paul Dobson  (English)   The main antagonist, Naraku (literally means ""underworld"", or ""hell"") is responsible for nearly every characters suffering throughout the series. He is a hany that originated from a bandit named Onigumo (""Demon Spider""). Unlike InuYasha, he can choose the time of the month when he becomes his weak human form. Like InuYasha, Naraku's main goal is to collect all of the shards of the Shikon no Tama in order to become a full ykai. He had feelings for  Kikyo  because of Onigumo's love for her while he was alive. Later, he expels his human heart and with it his feelings for Kikyo and his human half, making him a full demon.       [ edit ]   Media     [ edit ]   Manga   See also:  List of InuYasha chapters   Written by  Rumiko Takahashi ,  InuYasha  premiered in Japan in  Shnen Sunday  on November 13, 1996 and concluded June 18, 2008. The chapters are also being published by  Shogakukan  in  collected volumes , with the first volume released in May 1997. As of November 2008, 55 volumes of the series have been released in Japan.   Viz Media  licensed the series for an English translated release in North America. The first volume was released in March 1998. At the time, manga was normally published ""flipped""--that is, printed in exact reverse order-- to conform to the American convention of reading books from left to right. This resulted in the individual pages being  mirrored  from the original, so the images seen are also mirrored leaving right-handed characters appearing to be left-handed. Though Viz has since stopped flipping their manga releases, as  InuYasha  was already well into printing by the time this change was made, it continues to be released in the flipped format. New volumes of the series are released quarterly, and as of January 6, 2009, 36 volumes have been released in North America.   Viz Media is also releasing a separate series of ""manga"" volumes, called ""ani-manga"", which are derived from the anime episodes using colored frames from colored frames. These volumes are slightly smaller than the regular manga volumes, are oriented in the Japanese tradition of right to left, feature new covers with higher quality pages, and a higher price point versus the regular volumes. Each ani-manga volume is arranged into chapters that correspond to the anime episodes rather than the manga.     [ edit ]   Anime   Main article:  List of InuYasha episodes   Based on the first thirty-six volumes of the manga series, the  InuYasha  anime adaptation produced by Sunrise premiered in Japan on  Animax  on October 16, 2000 and ran for 167 episodes until its conclusion on September 13, 2004. It also aired Animax's English-language networks in  South Asia  and  East Asia  and it was broadcast on  Yomiuri TV  and  Nippon Television .
