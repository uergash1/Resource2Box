We learned many of these fun facts searching over the internet, but we also used a book called ""Awesome Almanac Illinois,"" 1993 edition published by B&B Publishing, Inc. P.O. Box 393 Fontana, Wisconsin 53125.       The name ""Illinois"" came from the Algonquin word  Inini , meaning ""the men"" and ""accomplished."" The French later pronounced the word as  Illini  , and added  ois  to the ending. This made the name mean ""the tribe of accomplished (or superior) men.""     Illinois officially became a state on December 3, 1818. It was the 21st state to enter the union.     Illinois is 56,400 square miles thus making it the 24th largest state.     Illinois' widest point from east to west is 218 miles, and it's longest point from north to south is 385 miles.     Charles Mound in Jo Daviess County is Illinois' highest point at 1,235 feet. The lowest point in Illinois is the Mississippi River in Alexander County at 279 feet.     The geographic center of Illinois is 28 miles northeast of Springfield in Logan County.     Along with the ""Land of Lincoln,"" Illinois has had many other nicknames. Others include ""The Prairie State,"" ""The Garden of the West,"" ""The Corn State,"" ""The Hub of the Nation,"" and ""Crossroads of America.""     Illinois has 102 counties, with the largest being Cook County which is the home to the city of Chicago. Chicago is the nation's third largest city. The Illinois Blue Book, 1995-1996 edition lists the origins of each county's name.     In 1818 when Illinois first became a state, the population was 34,620. The 1990 census showed Illinois population at 11,430,602 which caused it to earn the title of the sixth most populous state in the United States.     The area known today as Illinois was discovered by French explorer Louis Jolliet and Jesuit Father Jacques Marquette in 1673.     Illinois is divided into 59 legislative districts and 118 representative districts. One member is elected from each of these districts, so there are 177 members of Illinois' General Assembly.     Illinois is bordered by five other states. They are Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and Wisconsin.     Illinois ranks third in the nation in the number of interstate highway miles.     Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American Women elected to the Senate is a native of Chicago.     In April 1955 Ray Kroc opened his first McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois.     Otto Schnering of Chicago owned a candy company called Curtiss Candy Company that had a candy called Kandy Kate. When he had a ""rename the candy bar contest"" the winner was ""Baby Ruth."" Although many people thought the candy bar was named for the baseball star Babe Ruth, it was really named after President Cleveland's oldest daughter, Ruth, who died of diphtheria at 12 years old.     In 1949 Chicago-O'Hare International airport was named to honor Lieutenant Commander Edward H. ""Butch"" O'Hare who was a navy pilot and received a Medal of Honor. O'Hare International airport is the busiest airport in the world, with a flight taking off or landing every 20 seconds."

This 1781 map, drawn by a military officer, shows the positions of the British, American, and French forces in early October 1781.    Map Collections  (1500-Present)                On  October 19,  1781, British General Charles Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown, giving up almost 8000 men and any chance of winning the Revolutionary War.  Cornwallis had marched his army into the Virginia port town earlier that summer expecting to meet British ships sent from New York.  The ships never arrived.      In early October, some 17,000 American and French troops led by Generals  George Washington  and Jean-Baptiste Rochambeau surrounded British-occupied Yorktown.  Off the coast, French Admiral Fran√ßois de Grasse strategically positioned his naval fleet to control access to the town via the Chesapeake Bay and the York River.       The Franco-American siege exhausted the British army's supplies of food and ammunition.  With no hope for escape, Cornwallis agreed to the terms of Washington's  Articles of Capitulation , signing the document at  Moore House  on October 19.   Hours after the surrender, the general's defeated troops marched out of Yorktown to the tune ""The World Turned Upside Down.""

Cornwallis's surrender   at Yorktown effectively ended the Revolutionary War.  Lacking the financial resources to raise a new army, the British government appealed to the Americans for peace.  Almost two years later, on September 3, 1783, the signing of the  Treaty of Paris  brought the war to an end.

Elizabeth Blackwell   to Baroness Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron ,   letter concerning women's rights and the education of women physicians,   March 4, 1851.    Words and Deeds in American History         On  October 19 , 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell graduated from Geneva Medical College.  She was the first woman to receive a medical degree in the United States.    Although Blackwell had been studying medicine on her own for four years when she began applying to medical schools, Geneva Medical College, a forerunner of Hobart College in upstate New York, was the only institution to accept her application.  She entered the college in 1847 and graduated the head of her class two years later, despite having endured ostracism by students and townspeople for daring to challenge barriers against women in the field of medicine.     In 1851, after completing graduate studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, Blackwell returned to the United States.  Barred from practicing in city hospitals, she opened a small dispensary in the tenement district of New York City.  In 1857, she and two other recent medical school graduates opened the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, a hospital staffed entirely by women.

GX086-26-14467764	"Commission News                  Artists' murals express cultural, community pride      I n a project between NIPSCO Industries and artists Tom Torluemke and Geoffry Smalley, a stark brick building has been transformed into a vibrant, colorful reminder of a city's cultural and community history.   The project began when Louis A. Ortiz, corporate art coordinator for  NIPSCO Industries , contacted Torluemke about the  Substation #9 project . NIPSCO was working with  Northern Indiana Arts Association  to turn the vacant two-story building into a community arts center. But Ortiz and NIPSCO President and CEO Gary Neale wanted this to be more than a renovation project. They agreed the building could do more than provide space and opportunity.    Geoffry Smalley (l) and Tom Torluemke (r) (NIPSCO photos)   A plan was formed to create murals on either end of the building. Torluemke says murals are ""a gift to the community and are intended to beautify and advertise that art is alive in Hammond.    The Hugging Wall (NIPSCO photo) Torluemke's design,  ""The Hugging Wall,""  covers the 30' x 50' east wall of the substation building and speaks to the importance of human love in holding communities together.   ""Being an inner city native of the near northside of Chicago, in a neighborhood that was mixed racially and culturally yet primarily blue collar industrial, I was witness to the closing of many factories.    The once secure lifestyles of my friends' families seemed to unravel. The only thing that seemed to hold these families together was the love they had for one another,"" Torluemke explained. ""This was the experience I found myself reliving in Hammond. The Hugging Wall tells the story of many different people, young and old, living in an intense urban industrial area. Trying to survive by sheer faith and the strength of love they feel for each other.""      Fellow artist Geoffry Smalley chose to relate Hammond's industry and growth in his west side mural. The city's industrial growth began with George H. Hammond's meat packing plant.   ""At the top right is a logo design using images of cows suggesting the packing plant, and a circular logo that says,  Recalling History (NIPSCO photo)   'Watch us Grow,'"" Smalley said. ""This logo serves a dual purpose, both telling of a historical event that shaped the city, as well as foreshadowing the shaping of the city through the arts and history.""

Buster               and  Beau  are the First Dogs of the Commonwealth.              Buster, a two-year-old Portugese Water Dog, moved with the family              from Alexandria. [ Look at another              picture of Buster. ] Beau, the newest addition to the family, is              a cock-a-poo ‚Äî a combination of a cocker spaniel and a poodle.              [ Look at another picture of Beau. ]              While the dogs mainly play in the back garden of the Mansion, they              sometimes greet guests at the front gate and inside the front door.              They love squeaky toys, chasing each other in the garden, and being              fed treats by the Mansion staff.               Secret Tunnels               Far beneath the green grass of Capitol Square lies a labyrinth,                or maze, of secret tunnels. Unseen by the public, these tunnels                connect multiple buildings, including the Capitol, the Executive                Mansion, and the Old State Library. Many exciting rumors have surrounded                the use of the tunnels, but the network was built in 1939 simply                as a way to run pipes for steam heat between the buildings. Today                the tunnels are used to house cabling for electricity and telecommunications,                as well as pipes for steam heat.                                           ¬†                                                     ¬† Governor's Web site                                Pied mont ¬†-¬†n. - A plateau region of the eastern United States extending from New York to Alabama between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic coastal plain.

""I have fogotten the name of the first doctor who located at Moscow, but recall some of the stories told of him by some of the young fellows with whom I associated. In the '40s and early '50s, when the country was settling up, there was a great deal of sickness, mostly fever and ague, and the doctors used a great deal of calomel and quinine. One day when returning from a visit the Doctor saw that the horse he was riding was sick and that he shook like a person with the ague. The Doctor gave him a dose of calomel, then turned him out to graze. In a few days the horse lost every hair that was on his body and ran on the prairie north of town until another coat of hair grew. I do not know how long the Doctor remained at Moscow, but the town was without a doctor for some years previous to 1850. In the spring of that year a young doctor by the name of Baxter located here and remained until the spring of 1852, when he went to Oregon and during the summer of 1852 Dr. W. H. Baxter located here and remained until 1866, when he went to Wilton.""  I notice that this is all part of a lengthy quote from somewhere and I do not see any attribution, but I didn't look too hard ...  ---------------   http://www.geocities.com/arizona1900/Reynolds.html   The History of Mercer County 1882 mentions that ""... Charles Drury, returning in the fall of 1835, was married to Miss Nancy Prentice, who died eleven months after.  He then moved to Rock Island county and studied medicine with Dr. Reynolds, after which he married Mrs. Eliza McGreer, moved back and practiced medicine throughout the township, living upon what is known as the E. W. Mardock farm [NE Sec 3T15NR5W- see Eliza plat map].  He quit the practice of medicine in 1851 and moved to Oregon.""  This statement bears examination, as Eli Reynolds seems to have been in Iowa at that time.  The History of Rock Island County mentions only James, William, and Drury Reynolds as arriving shortly after 1837.  Without a date, it mentions, ""The first physician in the county was kind Doctor Reynolds, whose generous sympathy and hearty good will are remembered by the older generation.  His well-known figure was a welcome presence in many a sick chamber, and he never hesitated to journey forth in rain or snow, day or night, over the then almost impassable roads to succor those who were in need of his ministrations.  His type of physician is gone.  Perhaps the modern physician is a great improvement upon the old kind, but there are many who reposed a trust in the country doctor no twentieth century practitioner can command, for his word was absolute law, and in his hands reposed literally the keys to life or death.""   Charles and Eliza Brandenberg McGreer Drury are in Eliza Township in Mercer County in the 1850 census, indicating Charles studied in Rock Island County with Eli Reynolds before that date.   Perhaps one of the Drury links on this site might also be of interest.  Happy Thanksgiving!  Godspeed!

The war of the American Revolution had begun and the         thirteen colonies on the Atlantic seaboard had declared their         independence. The English plan of war combined campaigns along         the coast with raids, chiefly from Detroit, by English partisans         and Indians against the whole frontier. It seemed that the         latter movement would exterminate the settlers in the         ""Great Valley,"" or drive them back east of the         mountains.            George Rogers Clark conceived the desperate, but brilliant         plan of a far-reaching, offensive expedition for the occupation         of the posts held by the English north of the Ohio River. After         overcoming the most disheartening difficulties and         disappointments, he had led a force of less than two hundred         Virginians and Kentuckians from Corn Island (Louisville) to the         posts on the east side of the Mississippi below St. Louis. He         took them entirely by surprise and without resistance occupied         Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Cahokia.            At this time the only settlers in the Old Northwest were the         French. England had won this region only recently, in the French         and Indian War and by the Treaty of Paris. Before the outbreak         of the Revolution it had been part of the Province of Quebec. In         1778 France had entered into and alliance with the United States         and the French on the Mississippi and Wabash, apprised by Clark         of this alliance, gladly changed their allegiance to         ""Virginia and the Continental Congress.""            The Indians of this region, however, far outnumbered all the         French settlers; the English and Clark's force put together. If,         in 1778, as Clark reached Kaskaskia and Cahokia, they had         combined against him, his little force would have been quickly         destroyed. With bravado and apparent unconcern about the choice         the Indians might make, Clark told them about the war between         the United States and England, stated with apparent assurance         that the Americans, the ""Big Knives,"" were going to         drive the English out, and told the Indians to decide whether         they would fight the Americans or remain neutral.            His demeanor, his firmness, and his personal force decide the         issue, which, had it reached the decision of arms would have         been fatal. The Indians chose the white belt. During the rest of         the war, while many of the Indians joined the English in raids         upon the frontier, all of them held Clark in such awe that his         presence and even his name was worth an army of occupation. His         dealings with the French and with the Indians marked him as one         of the great statesmen of the Revolutionary period.

They mention many of the families I am trying to trace.  I now have a list of about a dozen families that left this four county area, Muscatine and Louisa counties, Iowa, and Rock Island and Mercer counties, Illinois, in 1852 and went to Oregon and California.  Most of them had connections in Indiana before they came to Iowa, and some as far back as Rev War times in Virginia and North Carolina.  There also seems to be a strong Mormon connection to many of the families.  I have been able to locate most of the families in Oregon.  I have not been able to find any records of Dr. Charles Drury however, until he ended up back in Iowa/Illinois.

Portfolio 4  of Prints and Photographs: An Illustrated Guide    The pseudonymous artist Arribas produced this poster  for two Spanish labor organizations,  Union General de Trabajo  and  Confederacion Nacional de Trabajo , to express indignation at Franco's foreign-backed aggression.             The Spanish Civil War began on  July 17 , 1936 as a series of military insurrections throughout the country. Because the Spanish Civil War was the first major military contest between left-wing forces and Fascists, it has been called the first chapter of World War II.  The Republicans fought to maintain the Republic while the Nationalists sought to restore the monarchy.    Because the Spanish Civil War represented a major threat to international political equilibrium, Americans discussed and watched closely the events of the conflict.  Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Spanish soldiers and civilians died from war or war-engendered disease and starvation and thousands of Spaniards became refugees.  The situation forced many Americans to question America's post-World War I non-interventionist policy.     The Republicans, or Loyalists, received aid from France, the Soviet Union, and Mexico.  Sixty thousand members of the International Brigades, some 2,800 of whom were men and women from the United States, volunteered their services.  During the war, the Nationalists received troops, tanks, and planes from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. Germany field-tested some of its most important artillery in Spain prior to World War II.

The ten students of the college met for their first classes, conducted in Latin and Greek, in a schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church at Broadway and Wall Streets.     The early college educated a number of American patriots and intellectuals including several members of the  Continental Congress .  Among its first students and trustees were  Robert R.

Father                            Tug Farish of Lane's End Farm in Kentucky                                                         Namesake                            Named after Scott Fletcher, a former Texas Rangers baseball                            player                            A                            Story about Spotty by Spotty                             One                            day my owners put me on a plane and took me to a huge                            white house with many rooms to explore. As I searched                            the house looking for tennis balls and bones, I was                            surprised at how familiar the place smelled. It was                            as if I had been there before.                           I                            nudged my owner, President Bush, on the ankle and he                            said to me, ""Well, Spotty, how does it feel to be living                            again in the same house where you were born?""                                                      Then it all made dog sense. This big house is the White House, the place where I was born on March 17, 1989. My mother, Millie, took care of me and my brothers and sisters before President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush took me to their house in Texas.                                                      Today,                            my owner lives in this house, and he has a new name.                            My favorite name for him is ""Dubya,"" but everyone calls                            him ""Mr. President."" I just call him my best pal.
