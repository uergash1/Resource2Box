clueweb09-en0000-47-14558	"             AVP’s 2008 Olympics Blog Site     AVP’s 2008 Olympics Blog Site                         About the AVP            The AVP was established in 1983 and is comprised of the best men’s and women’s pro beach volleyball players in the U.S. and arguably, the world. The AVP’s main goal is to deliver its fans the experience of an amazing athletic contest surrounded by an unforgettable beach party. More than one million people are expected to attend an AVP event this year. On May 31, 2001 the AVP was reorganized with a new management team led by agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. When they announced the acquisition of the tour in Manhattan Beach, Calif. they made a historic move by uniting both men and women professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization. With this historic unification of the men’s and women’s competitions, the “new” AVP Tour has been able to capitalize on having one property that could maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money. The AVP now stands alone as the only pro beach volleyball tour in the country and has a cooperative relationship with USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB).

The AVP's main goal is to deliver its fans the experience of an amazing athletic contest surrounded by an unforgettable beach party. More than one million people are expected to attend an AVP event this year. On May 31, 2001 the AVP was reorganized with a new management team led by agent Leonard Armato and his company Management Plus. When they announced the acquisition of the tour in Manhattan Beach, Calif. they made a historic move by uniting both men and women professional beach volleyball players under one umbrella organization. With this historic unification of the men's and women's competitions, the ""new"" AVP Tour has been able to capitalize on having one property that could maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money. The AVP now stands alone as the only pro beach volleyball tour in the country and has a cooperative relationship with USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB).

Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in Holyoke, Mass., decides to blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game for his classes of businessmen which would demand less physical contact than basketball. He creates the game of Volleyball (at that time called mintonette). Morgan borrows the net from tennis, and raises it 6 feet 6 inches above the floor, just above the average man's head.           1920s           There are unconfirmed whispers of men's teams playing on the beach in Hawaii, but most accounts place the sport's origin in Santa Monica, California where the first Volleyball courts are put up on the beach at the Playground.

The BVA is created to guide and promote the growth of women's beach volleyball in the United States. ""A strong domestic tour is crucial in order to develop US athletes for the top levels of international play, in particular the Olympic Games in Sydney."" said Charlie Jackson, tour CEO. For this reason, BVA is working closely with the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and the Olympic Challenge Series (OCS) to maximize opportunities for the women and avoid schedule conflicts.           2000     BVA     In May, the BVA held its first tournament in Oceanside, CA.

The last team to qualify, Americans Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana win the gold over Brazilians ZMarco and Ricardo Costa.  The 15th-seeded German team of Jg Ahmann and Axel Hager are surprise bronze medalists.

With this historic unification of the men's and women's competition, the 2001 AVP Tour will be able to capitalize on having one property that can maximize sponsor dollars, marketing opportunities, media coverage and prize money.  The AVP will now stand alone as the only professional beach volleyball tour in the country.  It will follow the regulations set forth by USA Volleyball and the Federation International de Volleyball (FIVB) and will allow its players to compete in official tournaments en route to the 2004 Olympics.               2001     FIVB     The 2001 Goodwill Games feature Beach Volleyball competitions from August 29 to September 4 in Brisbane, Australia with the world's sixteen best men's and women's teams.
