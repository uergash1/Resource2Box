In addition to writing code, computer programmers are also called on to repair, modify, expand, and update older programs that have already been written.

My goal in this series of articles is for you to understand asset allocation thoroughly, in an easy to understand format.                                                          403b Savings Calculator             Retirement Calculator, Inc.     403bsavingscalculator.com                         What Can You Do With a 403b Savings Calculator?   Those individuals who work for a variety of non-profit agencies, colleges and universities and local governments often have an employer sponsored 403b account rather than a more common 401k. Just as with a 401k, those who have 403b accounts may find that their contributions are matched by their employers or not. Likewise, those who have a 403b account are given choices about how they want to invest, how much they want to invest and whether or not to open additional savings and investment accounts to help them prepare for retirement.       A 403b savings calculator, at its most basic, is a tool that enables those of you with 403b accounts to see how much the money that you've put into the account is earning for you. A  403b savings calculator  lets you take a closer look at your investments than you are able to do simply by looking at the statement that you receive that's meant to tell you how your account is doing.    However,  a 403b savings  calculator should do more than just let you see what is there in your account and provide you with some idea about how your  money will continue to grow over time. With the  right 403b savings calculator, you should be able to:  Look at the amount that you are contributing and determine how much of a difference a greater contribution per pay period would make in your retirement saving;  Look at the different mutual funds and stock options that you have for investing to see whether or not you would benefit by investing your 403b savings differently;  Experiment with your savings and investment strategy to see whether or not you are investing as well as you could be;  Consider the past and projected performance of the stocks and mutual funds that are available to you;  Better understand the risk that you are taking when you choose one investment over another.       Additionally, if not all of your retirement planning is being done with your 403b, you're probably going to want something more than a basic  403b savings calculator  - something like the retirement calculator you can download on this page that will allow you to do everything that you need to in order to understand your 403b savings as well as all of your other retirement savings and investment accounts.   Not only does the retirement calculator allow you to get a feel for your accounts on your own, but when you download it your contact information will be forwarded to a financial advisor in your area who will call to follow up and answer any questions that you have. In other words, you won't just get a  403b savings calculator  or a retirement calculator, you will also get the chance to talk about your goals and options with someone who can help you to develop a better strategy - a plan for reaching all of your goals, whatever they may be.   Does the  403b savings calculator you've been using do all of that?

Analysis of the Economics of Early Social Security Withdrawal    Robert J. Phillips    Chief Retirement Consultant   Deciding whether or not to take the early withdrawal of social security at age 62 can be difficult. If you need this income at 62 to fund your retirement the decision is fairly straightforward. Take it early!  On the other hand, if you have another source of revenue to fund your retirement your decision will be primarily based on lifestyle, health and investment preferences.   Several factors can affect your decision. First is your life expectancy. If you are in good health and have a family history of living beyond 90 then waiting for full benefits may be best. Two other factors impact this decision. First and most important is the value of money or your expected return from your investments. If you are using other investments instead of social security to fund your retirement you should use the rate of return of these investments as your value of money. There is another way to look at the value of money. If you do not require the social security money to live, you can invest the distributions for the future. The rate of return of this investment is your value of money. If your investments will make larger returns such as stocks this would favor taking the early withdrawal.   The last factor impacting your decision is inflation. Social security includes an annual adjustment based on inflation. You cannot control this variable but you should be aware of its impact. If future inflation is significant it will favor a later full distribution    FREE Social Security Calculator:   Find Out Your Breakeven Age   We developed a calculator to assist in analyzing the impact of taking early benefits at age 62 or waiting for full benefits at age 66 to 67 depending on the year you were born...If you were born in 1960 or later your full benefits will begin at age 67 and your reduction for early benefits at age 62 will be 30%. If you were born between 1946 and 1960 your full benefits begin as early as age 66. We have included a chart that summarizes information.   To use the calculator you need to input your year of birth. You also need to input a value of money up to 10% and a projected inflation adjustment. The calculator analyzes income generated over time from both the early and full benefit investments. It calculates the age at which full social security will catch up and breakeven with the early withdrawal. If you were born before 1960 your breakeven age will be impacted by the year you were born. An early breakeven age favors waiting for full benefits.   The social security calculator is not the final answer whether to take an early withdrawal but it does give you additional economic data to assist in that decision. Ultimately you must balance income, investments and lifestyle to optimize your enjoyment during your retirement years.                                     © Copyright 2008 Retirement Calculator, Inc.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.

It affords the couple most of ""the same rights, protections, and benefits, and shall be subject to the same responsibilities, obligations, and duties under law..."" as married spouses.  [ 1 ]   Enacted in 1999, the domestic partnership registry was the first of its kind in the  United States  created by a legislature without court intervention. Initially, domestic partnerships enjoyed very few privilegesprincipally just hospital-visitation rights. The  legislature  has since expanded the scope of California domestic partnerships to afford many of the rights and responsibilities common to marriage. As such, it is now difficult to distinguish California  domestic partnerships  from  civil unions  offered in a handful of other states.   Although the program enjoys broad support in California, [ 2 ]  it has been the source of some controversy. Groups opposed to the recognition of same-sex families have challenged the expansion of domestic partnerships in court. Conversely, advocates of  same-sex marriage  contend that anything less than full marriage rights extended to same-sex partners is analogous to the ""separate but equal"" racial laws of the Jim Crow era.

Consult the  California Secretary of State  for the most current information. [3]     [ edit ]   Scope   As of 2007, California affords domestic partnerships most of the same rights and responsibilities as marriages under state law (Cal. Fam. Code 297.5). Among these:     Making health care decisions for each other in certain circumstances   Hospital and jail visitation rights that were previously reserved for family members related by blood, adoption or marriage to the sick, injured or incarcerated person.   Access to family health insurance plans (Cal. Ins. Code 10121.7)   Spousal insurance policies (auto, life, homeowners etc..), this applies to all forms of insurance through the  California Insurance Equality Act  (Cal. Ins. Code 381.5)   Sick care and similar family leave   Stepparent adoption procedures   Presumption that both members of the partnership are the parents of a child born into the partnership   Suing for wrongful death of a domestic partner   Rights involving wills, intestate succession, conservatorships and trusts   The same property tax provisions otherwise available only to married couples (Cal. R&T Code 62p)   Access to some survivor pension benefits   Supervision of the  Superior Court of California  over dissolution and nullity proceedings   The obligation to file  state tax returns as a married couple (260k)  commencing with the 2007 tax year (Cal R&T Code 18521d)   The right for either partner to take the other partner's surname after registration   Community property rights and responsibilities previously only available to married spouses   The right to request partner support (alimony) upon dissolution of the partnership (divorce)   The same parental rights and responsibilities granted to and imposed upon spouses in a marriage       [ edit ]   Differences from Marriage   While domestic partners receive most of the benefits of marriage, several differences remain. These differences include, in part:     Couples seeking domestic partnership must already share a residence, married couples may be married without living together.   Couples seeking domestic partnership must be 18 or older, minors can be married before the age of 18 with the consent of their parents.   California permits married couples the option of  confidential marriage,  there is no equivalent institution for domestic partnerships. In confidential marriages, no witnesses are required and the marriage license is not a matter of public record.   Married partners of state employees are eligible for the  CalPERS  long-term care insurance plan, domestic partners are not.   There is, at least according to one appellate ruling, no equivalent of the  Putative Spouse Doctrine  for domestic partnerships.  [ 3 ]     In addition to these differences specific to state law, should the  Defense of Marriage Act  be found unconstitutional or repealed, married persons in California might enjoy all the federal benefits of marriage, including Constitutionally-required recognition of their relationships as marriages in the rest of the United States under the  Full Faith and Credit  Clause. [ citation needed ]   In addition to these differences specific to the United States, some countries that recognize same-sex marriages performed in California as valid in their own country, (e.g., Israel  [4] ), do not recognize same-sex domestic partnerships performed in California.   Many supporters of same-sex marriage also argue that the use of the word marriage itself constitutes a significant social difference, [ citation needed ]  and in the majority opinion of  In Re Marriage Cases , the California Supreme Court agreed,  [ 4 ]  suggesting an analogy with a hypothetical that branded interracial marriages ""transracial unions"".     [ edit ]   Eligibility   Currently, a couple that wishes to register must meet the following requirements:     Both persons have a common residence.   Neither person is married to someone else or is a member of another domestic partnership with someone else that has not been terminated, dissolved, or adjudged a nullity.   The two persons are not related by blood in a way that would prevent them from being married to each other in  California .   Both persons are at least 18 years of age.   Either of the following:    Both persons are members of the same sex.   The partners are of the opposite sex, one or both of whom is above the age of 62, and one or both of whom meet specified eligibility requirements under the Social Security Act.       Both persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.            Example of California domestic partnership certificate.       Also, a legal union of a same-sex couple, other than  marriage , validly performed in another jurisdiction, that is substantially equivalent to a  California  domestic partnership, will be recognized as such in California.  Civil unions , such as those performed in  Vermont ,  Connecticut , and  New Jersey , would most likely qualify as domestic partnerships in  California . A valid same-sex marriage performed in a jurisdiction that recognizes such unions, such as  Massachusetts , would not be recognized in California as either a marriage or a domestic partnership. This is due to the fact that  California statute  prohibits recognition of another jurisdiction's validly performed same-sex marriage.   British law  recognizes California domestic partnerships as equivalent to  civil partnerships  in the  United Kingdom . The attorney general of  New Jersey  has ruled that California domestic partnerships are equivalent to civil unions in that state and likewise that civil unions in New Jersey can qualify as domestic partnerships in California.  Switzerland  recognizes California domestic partnerships as comparable to  Civil unions in Switzerland , including granting residency rights based on the partnership.     [ edit ]   Registration   Domestic partner registration is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing their names and address. Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same sex couples must be collected pursuant to CA Family Codes 298, 298.5 and 358, to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard it is not like a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.     [ edit ]   Dissolution   In most cases, a domestic partnership must be dissolved through filing a court action identical to an action for dissolution of marriage. In limited circumstances, however, a filing with the Secretary of State may suffice. This procedure is available when the domestic partnership has not been in force for more than five years. The couple must also meet many other requirements that the dissolution be both simple and uncontested: no children (or current pregnancy) within the relationship, no real estate (including certain leases), and little joint property or debt. The parties must also review materials prepared by the Secretary of State, execute an agreement dividing assets and liability, and waive claims to domestic partner support. Where all the requirements are met, the partnership will terminate six months after the filing, unless either party revokes consent.     [ edit ]   Legislative history     [ edit ]   Attempts at the Municipal Level   In 1982, the  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  passed a measure to extend health insurance coverage to domestic partners of public employees, but did not provide for a registry available to the general public. Mayor  Dianne Feinstein  vetoed the measure. [ 5 ]  Eventually San Francisco enacted a similar measure, as did other communities, such as Berkeley, and some local agencies.   In 1984 the City of Berkeley was the first city to pass a domestic partner policy for city and school district employees. This followed a year of work by the Domestic Partner Task Force chaired by Leland Traiman. Working with the Task Force was Tom Brougham, a Berkeley city employee who coined the term ""domestic partner"" and created the concept. All other domestic partner policies are patterned after Berkeley's.   In 1985,  West Hollywood  became the first U.S. city to enact a domestic partnership registry open to the citizenry. Eventually other cities, including San Francisco, Berkeley, and Santa Cruz, followed suit. [ 6 ]   Despite successes in a handful of localities, supporters of legal recognition same-sex couples could not overcome the limited geographical scope and relatively modest range of programs administered at the county and city level. In the 1990s, they turned their attention the state legislature.     [ edit ]   Early attempts in the state legislature   Mirroring the experience of Californias local efforts, the state legislature did not initially succeed in providing health insurance coverage for domestic partners or creating a domestic partner registry for the general public.     Assembly Bill 627 of 1995:  In 1995, Assemblymember Richard Katz introduced a bill to create a domestic partner registry, open to both same- and opposite-sex couples. It sought to provide limited rights in medical decision making, conservatorships and a few related matters. It died in committee.  [ 7 ]   Murray-Katz Domestic Partnership Act of 1997:  At the beginning of the 19971998 legislative session Assemblymember Kevin Murray introduced Assembly Bill 54. It was similar to Assembly Bill 627 of 1995. After successfully negotiating two Assembly committees, Murray did not bring the bill to a vote on the Assembly floor. [ 8 ]   Assembly Bill 1059 of 1997:  In 1997, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced a bill that would require health insurance companies to offer for sale policies that would cover domestic partners of the insured, but did not require employers to provide the coverage. As later amended, it required employers who cover employees dependents to cover their domestic partners as well. The amended bill eventually gained approval of the legislature, but Governor  Pete Wilson  vetoed the measure. [ 9 ]   Domestic Partnership Act of 1999:  Kevin Murray, now a state senator, introduced Senate Bill 75 in December 1998. It was largely identical to his Assembly Bill 54 of 1997 and ultimately passed both houses of the state legislature. Governor  Gray Davis  vetoed the bill in favor of Assembly Bill 26, which was narrower in scope. [ 10 ]       [ edit ]   Establishment and incremental expansion     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 26 of 1999   Simultaneously with the Domestic Partnership Act of 1999, Assemblymember  Carole Migden  introduced Assembly Bill 26 of 1999. As originally drafted, it covered all adult couples, like its unsuccessful senate counterpart. Before bringing the bill to the Assembly floor, however, Migden narrowed its scope. Based on objections from Governor  Gray Davis , who did not want a competing alternative to marriage for opposite-sex couples, Migden eliminated coverage for opposite-sex couples where either participant less than 62 years of age. The bill passed, and Davis signed into law on September 22, 1999. It provided for a public registry, hospital visitation rights, and authorized health insurance coverage for domestic partners of public employees. [ 11 ]  While modest in scope, Assembly Bill 26 marked the first time a state legislature created a domestic partnership statute without the intervention of the courts. (Hawaiis legislature enacted a more expansive  reciprocal beneficiaries  scheme in 1997 in response to an unfavorable lower court ruling; Vermont enacted a sweeping  civil union  bill in 2000 at the direction of its state Supreme Court.)     [ edit ]   Assembly Bill 25 of 2001   In the first successful expansion of the domestic partnership act, Assemblymembers  Carole Migden  and  Robert Hertzberg , joined by state Senator  Sheila Kuehl , introduced a bill that added 18 new rights to the domestic partnership scheme. It also relaxed the requirements for opposite-sex couples, requiring only one of the participants to be over 62 years of age. The expanded rights included standing to sue (for emotional distress or wrongful death), stepparent adoption, a variety of conservatorship rights, the right to make health care decisions for an incapacitated partner, certain rights regarding distribution of a deceased partners estate, limited taxpayer rights, sick leave to care for partners, and unemployment and disability insurance benefits. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on October 22, 2001. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Other bills in the 20012002 legislative session   During the 20012002 session, California enacted five more bills making minor changes:     Senate Bill 1049  ( Speier ) permitted  San Mateo County  to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 13 ]   Assembly Bill 2216  ( Keeley ) provided for  intestate succession . [ 14 ]   Assembly Bill 2777  ( Nation ) authorized  Los Angeles ,  Santa Barbara  and  Marin  counties to provide survivor benefits to domestic partners. [ 15 ]   Senate Bill 1575  (Sher) exempts domestic partners from certain provisions voiding wills that they helped draft. [ 16 ]   Senate Bill 1661  ( Kuehl ) extends temporary disability benefits to workers to take time off to care for a family member. [ 17 ]       [ edit ]   Wholesale expansion   The introduction of  The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003  (or  Assembly Bill 205 of 2003 ) marked a major shift in the legislatures approach to domestic partnerships. Earlier efforts afforded domestic partners only certain enumerated rights, which the legislature expanded in piecemeal fashion. This bill, introduced by Assemblymembers  Jackie Goldberg ,  Christine Kehoe ,  Paul Koretz ,  John Laird , and  Mark Leno , created the presumption that domestic partners were to have all of the rights and responsibilities afforded spouses under state law. The bill did carve out certain exceptions to this premise, principally involving the creation and dissolution of domestic partnerships and certain tax issues. It also, for the first time, recognized similar relationships, such as  civil unions , created in other states. Because the legislation dramatically changed the circumstances of existing domestic partnerships, the legislature directed the  Secretary of State  to inform all previously registered domestic partnerships of the changes and delayed the effect of the law for an additional year, until January 1, 2005. Governor  Gray Davis  signed the bill into law on September 19, 2003.  [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Subsequent changes and clarifications   Since enacting The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, the legislature has passed several bills aimed at clarifying how certain spousal provisions should be treated in the context of domestic partnerships and made some modest changes. The legislation signed by  Governor   Arnold Schwarzenegger  includes:     Assembly Bill 2208 of 2004  ( Kehoe ) clarifies that health and disability-insurance providers must treat domestic partners the same as married spouses. [ 19 ]   Senate Bill 565 of 2005  ( Migden ) allows transfer of property between domestic partners without reassessment for tax purposes. [ 20 ]   Senate Bill 973 of 2005  ( Kuehl ) specifies that domestic partners of state workers are entitled to retroactive pension benefits, even if the worker entered retirement before the enactment of Assembly Bill 205. [ 21 ]   Senate Bill 1827 of 2006  ( Migden ) requires domestic partners to file state income-tax returns under the same status as married couples (jointly or married filing separately), effective in the 2007 tax year. [ 22 ]   Assembly Bill 2051 of 2006  (Cohn) creates programs and funding grants to reduce domestic violence in the  LGBT  community and increases the fee for registering a domestic partnership by $23 to fund these services. The new fees are effective January 1, 2007. [ 23 ]   Assembly Bill 102 of 2007  ( Ma ) allows parties to a registered domestic partnership to legally change their name to include the last name of their partner.  [ 24 ]       [ edit ]   Popular opinion   California public opinion has long supported legal protections for gay and lesbian couples. In early 1997, two and half years before any statewide recognition occurred, polls showed two-thirds of Californians supported the limited provisions in unsuccessful bills debated in the legislature at the time. There was also strong support (59 percent) for broader provisions (pension, health, leave and survivor benefits) that werent enacted until more than four years later. [ 25 ]   Polls consistently show a marked contrast between support for domestic partnerships and  same-sex marriage . In 1997, roughly 38 percent of Californians supported same-sex marriage. More recent polls show an increase in support for same-sex marriage, but few polls suggest that there is any more support for same-sex marriage than a statistical tie with opponents. [ 26 ]  On November 4, 2008, Californians voted, 52.2% to 47.8%, to eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Challenges to domestic partnerships   Despite broad support, Californias domestic partnership program has engendered opposition.     [ edit ]   Referendum   California law provides for  referendums , petition drives that would place any legislative enactment on the ballot for review. Following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, state senator  William Pete Knight  (author of the successful  Proposition 22  initiative) and Assemblymember  Ray Haynes  sought put the new legislation to a popular vote. The referendum failed to qualify for the ballot. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Litigation   Opponents of legal recognition for same-sex couples  filed two lawsuits in the  Superior Court of California . In the first case, state senator  William Pete Knight  sued Governor  Gray Davis  (later substituting Governor  Arnold Schwarzenegger ) on the grounds that A.B. 205 impermissibly amended  Proposition 22 , which Knight authored. Randy Thomasson (an opponent of gay rights and head of the Campaign for California Families) filed a similar lawsuit, which challenged both A.B. 205 and the earlier domestic-partner expansion in A.B. 25. Both lawsuits, consolidated into a single action, failed at the trial and appellate courts. In the wake of those decisions, opponents of legal recognition for LGBT families launched at least two recall efforts against Judge Loren McMaster, who presided over the trial-court hearings. The recall efforts also failed. [ 29 ]   Along similar legal lines, defendants in a  wrongful-death action  brought by the survivor of a domestic partnership mounted a defense based partly on the ground that the legislative enactments giving a domestic partner standing to sue for wrongful death ran afoul of Proposition 22 (among other defenses). That defense failed on appeal. [ 30 ]       Main article:  California Proposition 22 (2000)       Proponents of same-sex marriage,  including the City and County of  San Francisco , have challenged the states opposite-sex marriage requirements on constitutional grounds. In pursuing these claims, the plaintiffs argue that even the broad protections of Californias domestic partnership scheme constitute a separate but unequal discriminatory framework. In May 2008, the  Supreme Court of California  ruled in their favor in  In re Marriage Cases , overruling Proposition 22 and effectively legalizing same-sex marriage in California.       Main article:  Same-sex marriage in California         [ edit ]   Constitutional amendments   Immediately following the passage of The California Domestic Partner Rights and Responsibilities Act of 2003, a petition drive began to amend the  California Constitution  to forbid any recognitionincluding domestic partnershipsof  LBGT  relationships. [ 31 ]  The measure failed to qualify for the ballot.   For a month in early 2004,  San Francisco issued marriage licenses  to same-sex couples. The  Supreme Court of California  halted that process and later declared the marriages void. Regardless, four separate groups began petition drives to amend the California Constitution to prevent same-sex marriage and repeal domestic-partnership rights. [ 32 ]  The renewed efforts peaked in 2005, [ 33 ]  but have continued since. These groups have filed a total of 20 petitions, but none of the proposed amendments have qualified for the ballot. [ 34 ]   In 2008, two of these groups moved [ 35 ]  to qualify  ballot initiatives  to  amend  the  California Constitution  on the November 2008 ballot. One qualified as  Proposition 8 . The amendment eliminates the right of same-sex couples to marry, but does not repeal any rights granted to domestic partnerships and registration for domestic partnerships remains legal in California. [ 36 ]  In late 2008, Proposition 8 was passed by the voters, and its legality is now the subject of lawsuits in the California Supreme Court.
