By Eliana M. Hassen Corporate America finally got the memo -  Diversity  is a tool that can help build a stronger, more competitive and forward thinking company. So now, with guns blazing, diversity recruiting has become a major business initiative, often left in the lap of HR to figure out. I hate to tell you, but diversity recruiting is not the job of a recruiter; it's the job of every employee! Diversity recruiting  is not a task. It is a process that, if mastered, becomes an art. With the growing demand of talent, finding diverse employees is more difficult than ever. The key to successful diversity recruiting is to build a program that is embedded in the corporate culture. This will quickly make it everyone's job. So where do you start? How do you build a program? How do you embed diversity recruiting into the overall company culture and make it everyone's job? There are specific steps that an organization can take to jump-start their overall diversity recruitment initiatives. In recent years, companies have been hiring Chief Diversity Officers (CDOs) that report directly to the CEOs to ensure that aggressive diversity initiatives are met. Having dedicated resources to cultural diversity is a step that should not be missed by any organization. Your company may not need a CDO, but there should be a team that is dedicated to diversity recruiting. Five steps to build a diversity recruitment process, making it everyone's job! Step 1 - Build an internal team.  This should consist of recruitment or HR professionals and business unit participants. The more people throughout the organization that are involved, the more exposure diversity recruitment gets. There are many advantages to building this team, including a constant line of communication with the business units regarding cultural diversity challenges and initiatives. Senior level managers should also be targeted to join the team. This will help solidify the overall culture and drive the diversity recruiting initiative into their various groups. This not only strengthens diversity in the corporate culture, but it quickly engages different employees on different levels - creating an area of development or interest for many. Different people on the team can have various roles. Some can serve as a board and drive the initiatives. Others can participate in marketing to candidates and even interact with candidates, relating the corporate diversity goals to potential new employees. The key is getting as many people involved in the process as possible. Step 2 - Define the corporate goal for diversity recruitment and then brand it.  Diversity recruitment - like every major initiative in a company - should have a communication strategy outlining its audience, purpose and desired results. Everyone in the organization should have access to this information. Educating the organization on cultural diversity is a big part of that. Don't take it for granted that everyone in the organization understands diversity. Diversity is defined to include groups beyond race and gender; now it addresses age, disability, sexual orientation, religion and language as well. Getting everyone educated and in sync with the diversity recruitment goals can be as simple as featuring information in the company newsletter, receiving a memo from an executive, or featuring the message in a section of the intranet. Step 3 - Talent acquisition marketing is the next step.  Diversity recruitment should be strategic, targeted and measured for results. Often, a company doesn't follow basic business principals in recruitment that they would in other business areas. If a campaign were being launched for a new product marketing research, analysis, and development would be required. Then strategic and tactical outlines are created: how to market, define the audience and how to measure the results. This process will yield the best results in diversity recruitment, as well. I encourage you to define the goals for the various diversity areas and then create a targeted marketing plan to recruit those groups. Then, identify what the audience reads and how it searches for employment. An even bigger part of this is the ability to write compelling ads and optimize technology. Use the Internet and word of mouth to make the path from diverse candidates to your organization clear as the sound of a bell. (This should be a big hint to invite members of your marketing organization to be a part of the diversity recruitment team!) Step 4 - Employee Referral Programs (ERP) have proven to be invaluable in many organizations around the globe - use them to drive diversity!  Create different incentive plans or programs around diversity recruitment in your existing ERPs. This turns every employee into a diversity recruiter for the company. Employees should not only understand the diversity initiatives around recruitment, but also participate in them. Regular information, with goals, metrics and new initiatives should be communicated on a regular basis to every employee. Step 5 - The final step to creating a concrete diversity recruitment process is to build a diversity employee development program.  It may seem like a function outside of recruitment or talent acquisition, but it isn't. The reality is that everything drives recruitment and talent to an organization. What better way to attract top diverse talent than to have a proven track record of your success in developing and retaining them? Creating a development plan to ensure that diverse talent is equally distributed in different business areas and growing within the company creates a buzz. It also stands behind your overall commitment to diversity. Work with your career planning folks, find volunteer mentors, define job stretch and opportunity for the diverse employees you have now - and watch the reaction through word of mouth. It will impact the bottom-line. In summary and succinctly put, the five building blocks to create a diversity recruitment program for your company: • Build a team dedicated to diversity recruiting. • Define your diversity recruitment initiatives and brand them internally. • Focus talent acquisition marketing. • Create diversity referral programs. • Develop and retain the diverse employees you have through a special development plan just for them. Recruiting diverse candidates is everyone's job and you must give everyone the tools they need to do it.

With the forced retirement of Merrill Lynch CEO E. Stanley O’Neal, the ranks of African-American top gun Fortune 500 company CEOs was sliced from six to five. O’Neal’s fall had nothing to do with race, but rather questionable investments that caused the company’s stock to plunge, and supposedly being a loner type in a corporate culture that thrives on “good old boy” insider networking. But the demise of O’Neal, for whatever reason, still raises fresh questions about how committed many corporations are to making  diversity  a reality in their boardrooms and in management. The answer varies widely from corporation to corporation. Fifty companies appear on Fortune Magazine’s list of corporations with the best track record for cultural diversity. Minorities made up almost 21 percent of their boardrooms in 2003, compared with 11 percent two years earlier. The figures almost certainly have edged up even more since then. But for every one of the 50 corporations that makes diversity more than a buzz word, there are dozens more that pat themselves on the back for having one Latino, Asian or African American on their board, or for hiring a handful in lower-level management positions. In recent years, some of America's biggest and best-known corporations that have been widely praised as having a good track record on minority hiring and promotions have been plastered with discrimination lawsuits. Texaco, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Toyota have been thrust into the legal hot seat and have made costly settlements or signed consent decrees with the EEOC. Forty years after the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that forbade workplace discrimination and Executive Order 11246, signed by Lyndon Johnson in 1965, that prodded firms to promote management diversity, many companies still practice their own subtle brand of workplace apartheid. Despite the well-publicized rise of O’Neal and other black executives at AOL-Time Warner, American Express and Aetna, black CEOs are still a rarity at most of the Fortune 1000 corporations. The overwhelming majority of senior managers at these companies are white males, and as is evident from the rash of management discrimination lawsuits, women and minority managers are still paid less on average than their white, male counterparts. They are still just as likely to be pigeonholed in departments such as head of “special markets” or “minority affairs.” An embarrassing and highly publicized corporate discrimination case may bring the issue onto the public radar, but then it’s back to business as usual. That business, more often than not, is discrimination. It takes place quietly and far out of public view. The worst offending corporations employ a variety of tactics to mask discrimination. They issue glowing press releases, brochures, assorted handouts and annual stockholder reports loaded with pictures of smiling women and minority employees that tout their commitment to diversity. With much public fanfare, they establish  minority and women hiring  and training programs. The refusal of many companies to make cultural diversity the watchword in middle and upper management is bad enough, but even worse is the relentlessly hostile environment that many companies create and maintain toward minorities. Since 1990, the number of complaints of racial disrimination toward employees has climbed. Black and Latino employees have been poked with sticks, called racial slurs, have had pictures of burning crosses and white sheets placed near their lockers, have discovered the initials KKK carved on tables and benches, and even found nooses hanging at or near their desks. Most CEOs are not hypocrites when they say that they work hard to hire and promote more minorities and women. But the degree of real commitment to cultural diversity hinges on the commitment of a corporation’s top CEO and its board. When CEOs implement an outreach program that includes a diversity task force, aggressive recruiters, and a mentoring program aimed at moving talented female and minority employees up the corporate career ladder, cultural diversity will be readily apparent in the company’s hires and promotions. O’Neal’s departure was disappointing, given the still relative paucity of minority and women Fortune 500 CEO leaders. But even if O’Neal had stayed in good grace with Merrill, and had a long shelf life there, the challenge to corporate laggards on diversity wouldn’t change. And that is, don’t just preach it – practice it. About the Author New America Media Associate Editor Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

This sea change has happened without fanfare and almost without notice. In most organizations, the word inclusion has been added to all the company's diversity materials with no explanation. This article is a short account of why this shift has happened and what it means. Probably the most widely-read article on cultural diversity in organizations was Roosevelt Thomas's ""From Affirmative Action to Affirming Diversity,"" which appeared in the Harvard Business Review in 1990. Diversity, said Thomas, was no longer about complying with a legal mandate but about seeking to create a diverse workforce because it would be beneficial to the organization. Before 1990, most large companies had an Employment Equity and Affirmative Action Officer, usually a lower-level employee who worked in the bowels of the organization compiling statistics about how many employees were in targeted groups, eg, people of color and women. Diversity - A Numbers Game Throughout the 1990's, diversity continued to be about the numbers of different kinds of people in the workforce as a whole and at each level. Diversity staffs tried to increase the number of people of color and women in their organizations. They saw this primarily as a hiring task. During that decade, the definition of diversity expanded. Diversity came to include many dimensions beyond gender and race: age, class, disability, ethnicity, family situation, religion, and sexual orientation. Companies started to pay attention to their representation of all these groups. It became clear over the years that it was not enough to focus on hiring alone. It became important to retain ""diverse"" workers, as well. Some organizations were astonished to learn that after years of effort, they had fewer African Americans than they had earlier. Companies became aware that for the most part the upper ranks of their organizations remained heavily white and predominately male. These were the years when companies offered cultural diversity awareness training and diversity skills training to help their newly diverse employees work well together. It's the Culture Today, in the 2000's, as organizations try to retain diverse employees in their workforce, companies have started looking at the quality of these employees' experience in the organization. Do employees in all groups and categories feel comfortable and welcomed in the organization? Do they feel included and do they experience the environment as inclusive? To answer these questions, diversity staffs need to assess their environment and identify the barriers to inclusion, whether they are practices, policies, or the informal culture of the organization. Having identified barriers, the job of the diversity staff is to change the company culture and to create an inclusive workplace environment. Systems and Policies As inclusion becomes the focus of diversity work, the attention switches to the systems, policies and practices of the company. Several systems influence the degree to which the climate is inclusive:    • Communications    • Work assignment    • Training and education    • Performance management    • Mentoring    • Coaching    • Hiring    • Career development    • Flexible work arrangements; and    • Managers' accountability. Companies that are known for their inclusive climate do not rely on the goodwill of their managers but work hard so that each organizational system is equitable. Once barriers are identified, they take action to address them. Each system is analyzed to determine the degree to which it provides equitable access and benefits to all employees. Creating an Inclusive Environment: A Case Study Here is an example of how one company addressed inclusion issues: A division of an institute in the defense industry had the reputation of not being welcoming to women. For years, they had experienced difficulty in both hiring and retaining female employees at all levels but particularly in the highest ranks of management. For years they clung to the idea that what they needed to do was to hire two or three high-level women. But to their chagrin, as soon as they would hire a new high-level female executive, it seemed one of the other high-level women would resign. At first they explained these recurrent departures in terms of the personalities of the women - ""She has family problems,"" ""She is too aggressive,"" or ""She is too timid."" Gradually it dawned on them that these resignations were not about the women, they were about the culture and the organizational climate. This led to a whole new strategy. The director of the division created a Diversity Task Force to suggest and implement changes that would create a more inclusive workplace in order to support the efforts to recruit and retain women. The Task Force was supported with resources and time for its work. Guided by an organizational consultant and working in small action teams, they first conducted a series of focus groups to identify the issues and concerns of women in the division. Then they moved into action, devising a number of changes and short-term projects to address the important issues. As soon as a team implemented a change or completed a project, they took on another. Here are some of their accomplishments over the first two years:    • They created a buddy system for all new employees   • Senior Managers hosted a series of lunches to meet lower-level women engineers and learn about their projects    • All brochures about the division were revised to include pictures of women    • They created a website where articles about women in the workplace were posted   • They developed a special relationship with a women's engineering college, inviting students from that college to come on-site for field trips and setting up summer internships for women undergraduate engineers    • They instituted networking and professional development events for women    • Senior managers attended two training programs, ""Men and Women Working Together"" and ""Flexibility."" Two of their learnings about creating an inclusive climate were: 1) It doesn't take huge amounts of money to make significant progress; and 2) Changing an organizational culture is about doing many small things, not one or two big things. In reality, as this story attests, creating an inclusive environment is about a hundred small changes. As you look at your own organization, ask yourself: What are we doing, in ways large or small, to move from yesterday's diversity to today's need for inclusion?

Financial experts know that a diversified portfolio is the best way to build wealth, and business experts know that a culturally-diverse candidate pool is the best way to build a staff that will provide the maximum performance and results. “Study after study shows diversity creates a positive impact on businesses,” says Tracey de Morsella, who produces the Multicultural Advantage, a Web site with resources to help employers increase their effectiveness in diversity recruiting. Miami-based Convergence Media Inc., runs the site and publishes multicultural-focused directories. “Studies show culturally-diverse companies increase productivity, creativity and develop new and more varied products and services,” de Morsella says. “Most new business owners think, ‘I’ll deal with that later.’ Cultural diversity seems out of reach, but there are benefits to doing it right away.” Just don’t confuse diversity with representation, says Roosevelt Thomas, CEO of Roosevelt Thomas Consulting & Training in Atlanta, Ga., and author of Building on the Promise of Diversity (AMACOM Books, 2005, $27.95). Plan to Manage Diversity “Most companies who think they’re talking about diversity are really talking about representation,” Thomas says. He defines “representation” as a workforce that racially and ethnically reflects a company’s customer base. “The main benefit to a representative workforce is that society expects it,” he says. “Truth be told, it’s difficult to get ‘diversity’ through representation because most employers want to assimilate their candidates to their way of thinking and doing things. Those companies may have a ‘diverse’ workforce, but they also have a sameness of thought.” For example, Thomas says, if you hire African American, Hispanic and Asian candidates who all have Ivy League educations, you’re not getting diversity at all. Attribute and behavioral diversity don’t always come along with diverse ethnicities, he says. Functional diversity takes time to develop and it comes with its own set of challenges. “True diversity breeds difficulties, tensions and complexities,” Thomas says, “and that can be difficult to manage.” Companies need to plan for training, building skills, policies and processes to effectively manage diversity. Even so, Thomas says, companies are more likely to reach truly functional diversity with a representative workforce. “They should take on the challenge right away.” Managed well, diversity helps companies avoid that innovation-killer called groupthink, which locks employees into one way of thinking and stifles the ability to compete. Study after study has shown that cultural diversity improves customer focus, spurs creativity and innovation, and leads to better decision-making and problem solving, de Morsella says. Your Workforce Should Look Like Your Customer Base The population of America is changing. According to the 2004 U.S. Census, Hispanics (14.1 percent) now are the largest minority group, with African Americans (12.8 percent) second. Experts predict that by 2050, people of color will outnumber white Americans. Women, 51 percent of the marketplace, are also changing the American landscape. Research findings by BusinessWeek and Gallup led to a forecast that by 2010, women are expected to control $1 trillion, or 60 percent of the country’s wealth. They already buy or influence the purchase of 80 percent of all consumer goods. These are the faces of the marketplace, and if they’re not seen in your company, they’re likely to take their business elsewhere, de Morsella warns. Make Your Business Attractive to Diverse Candidates Diversity candidates are like any others - they want to find an employer with whom they’ll feel comfortable, have opportunities to advance and make a decent income. But, de Morsella notes, “If you have 20 people on staff and they’re all white guys, you send a weird message.” So how do you get a diverse staff? “You don’t go out looking for a black man or a Latino woman,” she says. There are potential legal minefields associated with diversity hiring, such as reserving spots or job openings solely for diverse candidates. It’s reverse discrimination and illegal. “The biggest mistake that companies [startups or established] make is being afraid - afraid of being called racist, being accused of setting quotas, etc.,” says Damali Ayo, a Portland writer and artist whose book, How to Rent a Negro (Lawrence Hill Books, 2005, $14.95) is intended to encourage open dialogue about race in the workplace. “People are so afraid of ‘doing it wrong’ when it comes to cultural diversity that procrastination and cowardice easily find their way in. Thus some companies who are strong in many areas find themselves weak in cultural diversity.” As you create your recruiting materials, build in a diversity message that says, “This is a great place to work,” Ayo says. “You just need to broaden your talent pool, and you’ll have no problem finding people from varied backgrounds.” Does Your Web Site Reflect Diversity? One easy way to attract a broad talent pool is by adding a diversity page to your Web site, de Morsella says: “This is a very low-cost method and will help your site show up on search engines for diversity. “If you’re not sure how to do it, go to the sites of major companies with a reputation for good diversity programs – Microsoft and Merrill Lynch, for example - and use them as a model.” De Morsella also urges including minorities and women on your board. “This puts a diverse face on your company and makes those from diverse backgrounds want to work with you,” she says. Widen Your Candidate Pool One of the simplest ways to recruit for diversity is posting your company on minority-focused Web sites that offer various combinations of job listings, recruitment-marketing services and diversity-related news (see related sidebar). De Morsella suggests that when looking for highly skilled talent and executives, tap into the local chapters of national groups. “It’s much less expensive,” she says. “Working through the national organization could cost up to $20K.” For entry- to mid-level, she advises looking to such advocacy groups as the Urban League. “I’ve done this to hire sales staff and interns, and it’s worked out great,” she says. “Most large cities have a local chapter and will be happy to send candidates right away.” It Won’t Pay If You Delay Begin your efforts to hire a representative staff as soon as possible because cultural diversity can make a huge difference in the bottom line. Robert Rodriguez is faculty chair in the School of Business & Technology at Capella University online, and chairman for the Hispanic Alliance for Career Enhancement, a nonprofit that helps companies attract, develop and retain Latino talent. On the Society for Human Resource Management Web site, he recounts how a representative and diverse workforce led to big profits for Frito-Lay. The Latino Employee Network at Frito-Lay proved invaluable during the development of Doritos Guacamole Flavored Tortilla Chips, Rodriguez writes. Members of the network provided feedback on the taste and packaging to help ensure authenticity, helping launch one of the most successful products in the company’s history. The snack generated more than $100 million in sales in the first year alone. “A diverse staff is going to give you the best performance and results,” Ayo says. “A diverse staff is only one of the tools you need to build the best business possible. You should treat it with the same immediacy and importance as you would in finding the right tools in every other area. “Become a leader in creating a diverse staff. Your clients’ confidence, staff morale, press coverage, productivity and, of course, your profits will increase for doing it.” About the Author Jackie Headapohl is a freelance writer for StartupNation.

With these principles in mind, here are ten things you must do if you want to  hire more top people and diversity candidates . All are essential. Nine out of ten is not good enough. Here's the 10-step recipe: 1. Create compelling jobs.  If a top person is fully employed or has multiple offers, then the quality of the job will be one of the top four factors determining which job the person will ultimately take (the other three: the manager, the company, the comp). If your online job descriptions start with a part number (or the requisition number) followed by the official title, the location, and some list of skills and requirements, you won't hire many good people. The title and the first two lines of the ad determine whether it will be read, so make sure that these first two lines create a buzz. The next paragraph must describe some of the projects and challenges in the job. Focus on the possibilities -- what the person will do, learn, and become -- not the requirements. I refer to this type of job description as a performance profile (here's an article for more on this). Make the person want to click the ""apply"" button. Referred candidates will always read the online job description before getting too interested. So don't ignore this step if you want to hire more culturally-diverse candidates or any type of person in high demand. 2. Job brand the job.  Somewhere in the job description, tie the job to the company vision, its mission, a big project, or some important strategy. This makes the job bigger than itself. ""Help us land the next generation of moon walkers,"" will be Northrup's and Boeing's message for the next shuttle program, even for those people working at the rec center. 3. Culturally brand the job.  Do you really have a culture that thrives on diversity, or are you just meeting some corporate objective? How many African-Americans, Hispanics, and women have been promoted this past year as a percent of all promotions? You need to capture cultural diversity directly into the job with more than just a legal-sounding EEO statement. 4. Develop marketing-oriented sourcing programs based on how your future employees look  for and apply for jobs.  Top people and candidates in high demand don't look for jobs or accept offers using the same job hunting approach as most people. For one thing, they're much more discriminating. The primary decision to take a new job is based on the future opportunity and current challenges. That's why steps 1-3 above are critical starting points. Since these people look for jobs infrequently, the jobs must be easy to find when they do look. We're now doing a big research study on how different diversity candidate groups look for new jobs (send an email to info@adlerconcepts.com if you want to participate or learn more). The results so far indicate that you can't go wrong by making jobs highly visible with compelling titles and great copy wherever your jobs are posted. As part of this, your career site must be easy to find, and it must make a diversity statement tied to the company strategy on the first page. Rather than hyperbole, why not have bios and pictures of real people who represent the opportunities for diversity candidates and women within your company? 5. Reach out and find your candidate.  If your target audience won't come to you, you'd better go out to them. This means you must leverage your employee referral program, and creatively use tools like ZoomInfo, Jobster, and LinkedIn, as well as advanced Internet data-mining techniques. For a start, establish an aggressive employee referral program targeted to your current diverse employees. Personally ask these pre-selected employees for the names of the best people they've ever worked with. Then get on the phone to recruit and network with these people, to leverage these names to get more names. You might want to conduct a Jobster campaign in combination with ZoomInfo's ethnic searching capability to jumpstart your efforts here. Regardless, make sure the job descriptions are compelling -- or everything else you do will be wasted. 6. Stay involved.  Make your marketing a process, not an event. My old UCLA MBA buddy, Henry Hernandez, now the VP and chief diversity officer at American Express, gave me this sage advice many years ago. The basic theme: Don't just show up for some recruiting event. Instead, you need to promote, sponsor, be involved, and be committed -- every month, every year, and not just a few days here and there. Providing the resources and time is how you convert lip-service into reality. 7. Get hiring managers involved early and often.  The recruiting department can't do it alone. Managers must be committed to the process and they must devote extra time and effort to make it work. They must devote even more time upfront to get it started. If you do everything else right but fail on this step, the process will collapse. 8. Conduct a professional and thorough interview . Too many people think the purpose of the interview is to assess candidate competency. Most of these same people don't even do this part too well, either. But the interview can and must be much more than this when hiring top people in any field -- and even more importantly when there is competition for these people. In these cases, the interview must meet these multi-factor criteria: • Extreme professionalism is exhibited by all interviewers. • The candidate spends at least an hour with key decision-makers. • The process respects a top candidate's slower and more thorough decision-making process. • The candidate is confident the interviewer has conducted a thorough and accurate assessment. • The candidate has talked four times more than the interviewer. • The candidate leaves wanting the job. I've written a lot of articles on these pages on how to do this. Have many of your managers know how to accomplish the above? 9. Recruit and close.  You'd better be able to handle every objection in the book, offer competitive compensation packages, and know how to use the interview to create opportunities. You do this by describing compelling challenges and having candidates describe relevant past accomplishments. Dig deep to validate the candidate's true role. Candidates need to earn the job during the interview. If you oversell, under-listen, or give the job away, you won't hire many high-dema  "

Although it may be this individual's job to    conduct interviews, he or she has nonetheless devoted an important    amount of time to discuss your qualifications and achievements.      Thank-you letters can vary in length from a few sentences to a few    paragraphs depending upon how you would like to utilize the letter. A    thank-you note can accomplish the following:           Thank the interviewer for his or her time, which is done easily     by simply writing ""Thank you"" or ""I would like to thank you"" at the     beginning of the letter.       Emphasize your qualifications. You may include phrases like     ""With my strong communication skills, I believe that I would be an     asset to your firm"" or ""With my determination for success and     ability to work well with others, I would be a strong resource at     your organization"". You don't need to include details about your     qualifications if you have already discussed them at the interview.     Simply recap one or two of your most outstanding merits or     strengths. However, you can also use the thank-you letter to mention     skills or experience you offer that you did not get to discuss at     the interview.       Integrate an opportunity for continuing communication with the     interviewer and/or the employer. Even if you don't think the     interview went smoothly, write your thank-you letter with     confidence. Indicate that you continue to be interested in the     position. Statements such as ""I am interested in starting a career     at (name of employer)"" or ""I would be willing to discuss my interest     again with you at your convenience"" will keep channels open for     other interviews or perhaps an offer.         If your interviewer told you that he or she would pass your resume to    someone else, express your appreciation and state your enthusiasm to    meet this person. Employers want to know that you are excited about the    possibility of employment and that you are eager to continue the    interview process. This correspondence paves the way for further contact    from the interviewer or another person at the company.      In addition to keeping communication open, sending a thank-you letter    will tell the interviewer that you already have the polished etiquette    skills of a professional employee. In general, you should type your    thank-you letters and envelopes in business form. In some cases, you may    feel it is appropriate to hand write a thank-you note to the    interviewer. If you choose this method, make sure that your handwriting    is very legible and use plain stationery.      Thank-you letters should be sent promptly within a few days after the    interview. Make sure that you have the correct spelling of the    interviewer's name, title, and mailing address. As with your resume and    cover letter, correct format and spelling are essential. Carefully    proofread your thank-you letters.      If you interview with more than one person at an organization, it is    appropriate to send a letter to each person you have met. At some    on-site interviews, you may see many people during your visit. Even if    you interview with 20 different people, it is a good idea to write to    each one. Try to reflect on something you discussed with each    individual. Try to make each letter a bit different when you are writing    to several people at one employer.      Don't underestimate the power of etiquette and attention to detail.    The interview does not end when you head for the door. The possibility    of an offer continues with the thank-you letter.                                                                                                        Test Preparation                         Schools & Programs   ( by     State )               Letter & Writing                         Career & Training                                                           SAT                                                     GRE               GMAT               LSAT               MCAT               TOEFL               IELTS                                                               Colleges and              Universities                            Graduate Schools                            Engineering Schools                            Business Schools               Medical              Schools               Law Schools                            Dental Schools                                                                             Personal Statement               Resume                                          Recommendation Letter               Business Letter                             Cover Letter                             Job Interview               Job Application Letter                                                                                      GED                 Professional Exams                                          Community Colleges               Online Degree               Financial Aid               Study Abroad                             International Students                                                                   Link to us  |                Contact us  |                Home  Copyright 2009       The Eduers.com .

The Importance of the Thank You Letter                                                    You've completed a successful job interview. What's the next step? You send a ""thank you"" letter thanking the interviewer for his or her time. This simple act can give you an edge over other interviewees. It's a common courtesy that allows you the opportunity to reiterate your interest in the job and keep your name in front of an interviewer. Some tips for creating an effective ""thank you"" letter:    * Make sure to send your note within 24 hours of your interview.    * You can either handwrite or type your thank you letter. Tailor it to fit the company's culture. Decide if it's more appropriate to send a formal typed letter or a personal handwritten note.    * If you choose to e-mail your letter, you should send a hardcopy too. E-mail is a fast way to get your letter in front of the right people, but a mailed letter is the best choice.    * Your writing reflects you - make sure it is error free. Check the letter for grammar, spelling and punctuation.    * Make the note personal. Don't just copy your note from an old letter you have on file. Reference specific things you talked about in the interview.    * If you interview with a few people, send a note to each one. Although you can use the same letter for each, try to tailor a sentence or two to that specific person    * If you expect a decision soon, find a way to get your note in the interviewer's hands fast - consider using e-mail, fax, or hand-delivery. A ""thank you"" letter can send an important message about you. It shows that you are truly interested in the job and want to project a positive image. It is the perfect opportunity to remind your potential employer of your qualifications and how you would fit in with the company. It also gives you the chance to correct any mistakes you might have made or add anything you might have missed.

The Importance of the Thank You Letter                                                    You've completed a successful job interview. What's the next step? You send a ""thank you"" letter thanking the interviewer for his or her time. This simple act can give you an edge over other interviewees. It's a common courtesy that allows you the opportunity to reiterate your interest in the job and keep your name in front of an interviewer. Some tips for creating an effective ""thank you"" letter:    * Make sure to send your note within 24 hours of your interview.    * You can either handwrite or type your thank you letter. Tailor it to fit the company's culture. Decide if it's more appropriate to send a formal typed letter or a personal handwritten note.    * If you choose to e-mail your letter, you should send a hardcopy too. E-mail is a fast way to get your letter in front of the right people, but a mailed letter is the best choice.    * Your writing reflects you - make sure it is error free. Check the letter for grammar, spelling and punctuation.    * Make the note personal. Don't just copy your note from an old letter you have on file. Reference specific things you talked about in the interview.    * If you interview with a few people, send a note to each one. Although you can use the same letter for each, try to tailor a sentence or two to that specific person    * If you expect a decision soon, find a way to get your note in the interviewer's hands fast - consider using e-mail, fax, or hand-delivery. A ""thank you"" letter can send an important message about you. It shows that you are truly interested in the job and want to project a positive image. It is the perfect opportunity to remind your potential employer of your qualifications and how you would fit in with the company. It also gives you the chance to correct any mistakes you might have made or add anything you might have missed.

They're not saying that they don't consider job skills important; however, first and foremost, they want their employees to have positive attitudes. You can probably relate. Nobody wants to be around someone that is negative or complaining all of the time. This ideal incorporates into the workplace. A positive attitude fosters a positive work environment. An upbeat employee is more likely to be productive, motivated and well liked. How can you project a positive attitude? Put on a happy face - You can't help but feel good when you smile. It is also contagious. When you smile, your co-workers will smile and so on. There will be positive energy in the office. Focus on the task at hand - Don't think about what went wrong yesterday. We all make mistakes. If you give your work 100% of your attention, you will have the concentration to do a good job. Stop the complaining - We all experience things that we do not agree with or do not like. However, instead of lingering on the negative, choose to forget about it and move on. A positive front will go further to advance your career. Create an inviting work space - You can create a positive work environment by keeping things organized. Clutter often leads to frustration and missed deadlines. Also, add a favorite photo or keepsake. Keep a positive outlook - Look at each day as a new challenge. By focusing on the positive, you will be more likely to get excited about work. Think of all the possibilities the day has to offer. A positive attitude is important, but it isn't everything. There are many qualities that add up to a successful employee. Remember to practice good work habits, follow directions, and use competent communication skills. It is also essential to dress suitably, use appropriate behavior, and demonstrate good job skills and knowledge of work operations. Remember that a good attitude can get you ahead, while a bad one might stifle your chances for success.

This simple piece of paper represents you and your employment history. It can determine if you get called for an interview or overlooked for another candidate. Considering this importance, you should make sure that your resume makes a good impression. You've created a resume before, but there might be additional tips that you didn't know. Use this helpful advice to get your foot in the door: -Include a clear and concise job objective. Make sure to highlight this at the top of your resume. Give potential employers a clear idea of your professional goals. -Modify your resume for the role you are applying for. You should tailor your resume to match the type of job you want. Change the objective and emphasize relevant skills. You don't want the main focus of your resume to be on experience that has nothing to do with the type of job you want. -Make sure you have relevant job experience. You need to have experience in the type of job you are applying for. Volunteer to get the skills you need, or highlight your existing skills and illustrate how they apply to the new position. -Include 10 to 15 years of work experience. This can help shorten the length of your resume and provide the most relevant work experience. If you have important experience beyond those years, you can mention it in your cover letter. -Don't include hobbies or personal information. Unless the hobby or information is relevant to the type of job you are seeking, you shouldn't include it on your resume. -Use action words to describe your duties. Pick strong verbs to explain your work history. Words such as ""managed, maintained, budgeted, performed, and exceeded"" are good ones to use to describe your duties. Make sure you get the interview you want. Review your existing resume and make sure it adheres to the guidelines above. It might make the difference of receiving a phone call or getting passed over in favor of a candidate with a better resume. Even if you are the best choice, you are only as good as your resume.

This is because   knowing how to write a resume  is only one  part of the equation. Combined with resume distribution efforts and networking,  solid resume cover letter writing can have a positive impact on your job search  campaign. Resume cover letters serve as an additional opportunity to sell your  worth.     Most job seekers decide to send their resume “naked” – without the benefit of a  strong resume cover letter. This is a big mistake. Resume cover letter writing  complements the resume since the content is written directly to the open position.  The cover letter helps the decision maker to draws conclusions. A resume cover letter can  make a difference between whether you are invited to an interview.      Including the resume cover letter, a job search requires other types of  correspondence including a thank you and resignation letter. Just like cover  letter writing, all job search letters share common goals – they should be  personal and leave a lasting impression on the reader. Without strong writing  skills, cover letter writing, thank-you letters and resignation letters is going  to be a challenge.

Just like your  resume  and the  job interview , your thank you letter provides one more important piece of information about you before a hiring decision is made.  Too many job candidates make the mistake of thinking that writing an interview thank you letter is optional - it's not.  But you're smarter than they are and that's why you're going to write one.   Interview Thank You Letters           Additional Resources         Behavioral Interviewing Technique     Job Interview Question Database     Behavioral Interview Question Database     Interview Power Words     Writing an Interview Thank You Letter   In fact, studies suggest that less than 10% of all interviewees follow up with an interview thank you letter.  That's good news for you because it gives you the chance to separate yourself from the rest of the pack.   Does writing a thank you letter lock you in as the successful candidate?  It's doubtful someone would make a hiring decision based solely on receiving a thank you.  But, that's not to say that a thank you letter wouldn't be used as a ""tie-breaker.""  The point here is this - regardless of your success in getting a job, an interview thank you letter leaves the  hiring manager  with a good impression of you and that can come in handy.   Thank You Letter Format   When you're writing an interview thank you letter, the format you'll want to use includes three components:     You'll want to start off by thanking the interviewer for taking the time, and giving you the opportunity, to speak with them directly.  You'll personalize this section of the thank you letter by providing information specific to your interview.    Next, you'll want to express your interest in working for their company and the job for which you interviewed.  This section can also be customized to something that was said or an experience you had during the actual interview.    Finally, you'll close out the thank you letter by reiterating your appreciation for the interview; offer to provide additional information if they have a questions and tell the interviewer that you're looking forward to hearing back from them on a decision.   You don't want to oversell yourself on the thank you letter.  The format used here is clean and to the point.   Recipients of Thank You Letters   If you met with several members of the hiring company during the interview, then you many want to send out multiple thank you letters.  You don't need to send a thank you letter to everyone you met - but anyone that took a significant amount of time out of their busy schedule to talk with you deserves this courtesy.   Hand Written Thank You Letters   Some people think that the thank you letter you send after the interview needs to be hand written.  In most instances a hand written letter is not necessary.  We live in the world of personal computers.  Unless you believe that a hand written thank you is in order because of the culture of the company or the nature of the job opening, a typewritten letter is just fine.   Emailed Thank You Letters   Unless the urgency of the decision or culture of the company dictates an emailed thank you letter you'll normally drop the letter in the US mail instead.  Emails are convenient to send and that's part of the problem - they are also perceived as being far less personal.   If a decision is going to be made right away, you may want to email a thank you that same day and follow up with a thank you letter via the US mail.   Interview Thank You Letter Timing   You should compose your interview thank you letter as soon as possible following the interview itself - preferably the same day.  You should do this for two reasons.  The first reason has to do with simply demonstrating to the interviewer that you're willing to take the time to write the letter right away.   The second reason for sending the thank you letter out right away has to do with your memory.  You should write the letter while the experience is still fresh in your memory.   Proofreading the Thank You Letter   Just because you're sending out the thank you letter immediately post interview doesn't mean you should take shortcuts.  The letter is going to be read by the hiring manager or recruiter and it may be the final impression you leave with that person before they make a hiring decision.   The last thing you want to do is send out a letter with spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.  Have a trusted friend proofread the thank you letter before you send it out.   Interview Thank You Letter Samples   Now that you know what to include on an interview thank you letter and when you should send it out, we're going to help you get started by providing a couple of sample letters.  As always, our samples are free to download and written in Microsoft Word.   We're going to provide you with three interview thank you letter samples, each tailored to a slightly different purpose:     Interview Thank You Letter Template  - This first thank you letter sample simply follows the rules outlined above in terms of template / format.    Clarifying Interview Thank You Letter  - This second thank you sample is an example of how you might want to use an interview thank you letter to clarify a point you were trying to make during the interview.    Omission Interview Thank You Letter  - This final thank you letter sample is an example you can use if you forgot to mention something during the interview and later realized this may be important information to bring to the attention of the hiring manager.

Prep #1:      Before the Interview      For many people, the interview process is their least favorite aspect of the job search. What do I wear? How do I present myself? What am I suppose to ask? What are the best responses? It all feels a little like walking through a minefield. One wrong step and ""Kaboom!""       For others, the interview process is where they feel the most confident, secure in the knowledge that ""If I can just get the interview, I'll get the job.""       Regardless of how you feel about interviewing, good planning and preparation can substantially improve your ability to participate in a productive manner, while increasing your confidence level during this important step in the job search process.       The following are some areas to prepare before the first interview is ever accepted:      Interviewing Isn't Just About How You Answer  the Questions      Effective interviewing is more than simply responding to the tough questions with the best answers, it also requires knowing the questions to ask, in return, so that you can learn all the information you need to make an educated decision. Job candidates sometimes have their eyes so set on the goal of getting a job that they fail to completely evaluate the position or company's fit for their own needs, goals and interests.       To avoid misunderstandings, equal responsibility falls to the candidate to clarify expectations of the position, prior to accepting a job. How many times have you heard a friend or colleague comment, ""This job isn't what they said it would be.""      Some questions you may want to ask a potential employer, include:                 What do you see as this position's     responsibilities on a daily basis? Weekly? Monthly? How, if at all, do you see these     responsibilities changing over time?                  What do you feel are the  most      important responsibilities of this position? ( take   notes! )                  What are some   additional aspects of this position that are unique to your company? ( hidden   responsibilities? )                  What was the reason   for this position's vacancy? ( new need? recent   firing? expansion? )                     How long has this   company been in business? ( are you interested   in a growing company, an established company, or one that's going through   restructure? )                     How many people do   you employ? How long does the average employee remain with your company? ( frequent   turnover is a warning signal )                     What are this   company current challenges? ( this question   can produce surprising information )                  What do you view as   this company greatest goals and missions? ( consider   how you can be part of the solution here )                       Has this company experienced a downsizing at     any time in its history, and if so, when?                   How long have you   worked for this company, and what do like the most about your position here?   ( is your interviewer happy with this company? )                  See even more  questions to ask on the  Tough Commonly  Asked Interview Questions  - The Long List!        Never forget that you have some amount of control regarding the course of this interview. By being prepared and perfecting your responses, and taking an active and participatory role in the process, you'll not only make the interview process easier and more productive for you, but for your interviewer as well.       The Tough Questions               Before the first interview, prepare answers to interview questions that are especially difficult for you to answer. These questions may be as ""simple"" as ""Why do you want to work here?"" to as complicated as ""Why did you leave your last position?"" or ""Why should we hire you?""

And then see even more tough interview questions on  the  Long List of Commonly Asked  Interview Questions .      References        Before accepting the first interview, you should get your  references  in order  and you may want to request that a  letter of  recommendation  be written on your behalf. This is not something you should be thinking about after references have been requested.             Contrary to common practice, you don't want to provide references prior to an interview or include them with your resume submission, unless the job ad specifically states that references are to be included with the submission.         Keep in mind that a potential job may not live up to your expectations. You're not going to know for  certain until after you've had the opportunity to interview. There's no good  reason to have your references contacted needlessly or repeatedly for jobs you  don't plan to accept. References contacted repeatedly also tend to lose their enthusiasm in the repeated telling.       Another reason to hold  on to your reference list information until the interview is that you want the opportunity to be able to contact your references prior to the interviewer's call, so that you can give them a heads-up, ""John Doe from ABC company is going to be calling you sometime today or tomorrow. I interviewed with him today about the Project Manager position they have open."" This will give you the opportunity to tell your reference about the important issues discussed at the interview. A reference who is prepared for a call, and not caught off-guard, will appreciate the heads-up, and by understanding what the interviewer is hoping to secure, beforehand, will likely provide a better reference. Your references want to help you, make this process as easy for them as possible.       Your reference list should match your resume and cover letter in letterhead style and stationery, and should include the following information for each reference listed:      Reference Name  Current Title, Current Company  Relationship to You (Mentor, Coworker, Supervisor, Client, etc.)  Phone Number  Optional e-mail address      Make sure your references have given you permission to provide the numbers you're releasing. Providing e-mail addresses for your references is an additional option, but again, get your reference's permission prior to releasing this personal information.       Dress For Success      Attention needs to be placed on appropriate interview attire, and the time to do this is before the first interview is scheduled.      Interview attire should not necessarily reflect the style or uniform of the company or position for which you're interviewing. In other words, if the company dress code is relaxed (khaki slacks, casual shirts), your attire for the interview should remain conservative, professional, and appropriate to the event (a business interview).       A suit coat and tie is appropriate interview attire for men, a dress suit or suit jacket with tailored slacks is appropriate interview attire for women. Avoid loud patterns or excessive color. You don't want to distract your interviewer by your attire.      Your clothing need not be new, but it should be in good condition; clean, well-pressed and well-fitted. If your interview clothes are new (it's not recommended to wear brand new, out-of-the-box shoes - break them in first!), nothing can put a person ill-at-ease faster than clothes that feel uncomfortable, unnatural or don't fit well. Try your interview clothes on before an interview is scheduled (sit, stand, and walk in them), and make sure they're comfortable, as well as appropriate (ask someone else's opinion). See how the combination of clothes you've put together really look when worn together - ""Wow, this tie does not match this jacket,"" or ""This jacket needs to be tailored, it's just too long for me"" are things that should be determined long before having to walk out the door for an interview meeting. Inspect your clothing closely for any wear, stains or damage.       Interview Attire Checklist:           Don't wear cologne (this may be offensive to     your interviewer, no matter how good it smells to you).            Make sure your socks match, each other and the     outfit you're wearing.            Wear shoes that are in good condition, match     your attire, and are comfortable to wear. No loud colors. No open toes.            If you carry a purse or briefcase, these too     should be conservative in color and design.            Make certain your hands and nails are clean and     in good condition (you probably ""speak"" with your hands more than you're aware).     Men should not wear polish. Women's polish should be conservative in color and nails     should not be an excessive length.            Check your clothing for stains, tears, loose     stitching and/or loose buttons - and repair.             Do not smoke and avoid being around others who     are smoking ~ the odor will stay on your clothing and may be offensive. If you have worn     the clothing previously, have it cleaned or dry-cleaned to remove all cologne, smoking,     and other odors.            Limit the amount of jewelry you wear. Keep it     simple and conservative.                 Check out the article "" Dress  to Impress: A Guide. "" It includes photo comparisons, dress examples (men and  women) and feedback from potential employers. Very well done!      Thank You Cards and Postage Stamps      The time to purchase ""Thank you"" cards and postage stamps is before you begin to interview. Have these in supply.      Extra Resumes and Reference Sheets      Be sure you have extra copies of your resume and reference list printed. You'll want to take at least two clean copies of your resume with you to each interview: extras for any additional interviewers in the meeting, and an extra copy to help you complete an application with the correct dates and information.       Having extra reference sheets will make it easier to contact your references after the interview.   ( Back to Top )          Prep #2:  You Have An Interview!      Congratulations! Being requested to interview is a clear indication of your potential as a job candidate for this position at this company. Very few employers will interview candidates they feel are unqualified. Knowing this, it's now your job to convince the employer or hiring manager that you're not just a potential candidate, but you're the right person for the job.      The following are some preparatory steps you can take before and during the interview that will aid your chances for a successful outcome:      Where Am I Going?      Knowing where you are going is half the battle. I mean this both literally and figuratively.       How well you present yourself will depend on how well you know yourself. What do you have to offer? What are your unique professional and personal characteristics, as they directly relate to the positions you are targeting? What are your personal and professional aspirations? What is it you are looking to achieve?       When that self-knowledge, or literal meaning of ""knowing where you are going,"" is completed, you need to take care of the figurative meaning of ""knowing where you're going"" by figuring out where the interview is going to be held and how you're going to get there.       One of the first things you should do after an interview is scheduled is to drive to the interview location (at least a day before the actual interview) to determine the location and how long it takes to get there. You certainly don't want to be late for this all-important appointment by underestimating travel time or travel conditions (or worse, get completely lost). By driving to the location (or taking the bus or whatever other transportation you'll) at the same time of day for which your appointment's scheduled, you'll be able to clock the time it takes you to get there, identify the level of traffic and any potential hold-ups (due to construction or road conditions), and locate where you'll be able to park your vehicle (is there a parking fee involved?). If you're taking a bus or other form of public transportation, you should time the distance from your bus stop to the front door of the building.       Once at the location, you should determine which building entry door leads to your interviewer's office, and on which floor the office is located. Is there a public restroom close by? Knowing this will save you time if you want one last opportunity to check a mirror, fix a tie or comb your hair.       If you add at least ten minutes to your travel time, you'll help to avoid any unexpected delays. If this added time makes you a few minutes early for your appointment, so much the better.       Darn, I Forgot To Ask . . .             Prepare a brief, written list of questions to take with you. A question you desperately wanted to ask the night before may vanish once you find yourself in the interview (""I've answered twenty questions, what was I going to ask?!""). Some questions may have arisen during the phone contact you had with the interviewer in setting up the interview appointment (""Mr. Jones mentioned _______, I need to ask him about that""). Or you may have questions regarding information you have learned about the company during your homework investigation (""ABC Company is showing expansion into the European Market. I'd like to learn more about this"").       Don't trust your powers of memory during an interview appointment, and don't allow the interviewer to take total control of the course the interview. This is a two-way exchange, and the only way that you can learn all the information you need to know to make an informed decision is by asking the types of questions that are meaningful to you.       Expect your interviewer to ask, ""Are there any questions you have about ABC Company?"" or ""Is there anything else you would like to know?"" and be prepared to have a response. Having been given this opportunity to address questions at your interviewer's convenience, don't assume that this same invitation will apply the next day (or when you get home and realize you failed to ask an all-important question). In other words, your interviewer may not appreciate a follow up call that begins with, ""Mr. Jones, after our interview I realized I had a few more questions I'd like you to answer . . .""       What Did They Say?!      It's a good idea to take notes during the interview (so add a clean pad of paper and working pen to the list of items to bring). The very first thing you should write down is your interviewer's name (this may not be the same person who called you), including the correct spelling (even if you have to ask the receptionist).       During the interview, write down the key criteria discussed and reiterate this information with your interviewer, ""As I understand it, Mr. Jones, this position will require . . ."" Using these notes to clarify your understanding of the position, both its responsibilities and expectations, and communicate your understanding back to your interviewer - this is called ""mirroring."" Mirroring will help clear any potential misunderstanding and will also give you a better record of what was discussed and agreed upon during the interview.       The notes you take will also be used when you write your follow up ""Thank you"" note, following the interview.       What To Take            Be prepared to bring along at least two clean copies of your resume to the interview. You may be interviewed by more than one person, and you will want to make sure these additional interviewers have clean copies of your presentation (rather than a photocopied version). You also may be required to complete an application. Having your resume with you will help you complete the form without trying (again) to remember specific dates and events.       Bring along at least two copies of your reference list to the interview appointment (one to give, one to use to call your references following the interview). Provide this to your interviewer only after you've determined  this is a position you still want to pursue. There's no need (or benefit) in having your references contacted needlessly.      You shouldn't need a suitcase, but here are some suggestions of items to take:           Directions and phone number for the company, in     case something deters your arrival.             A folder (to prevent bending) containing at     least two clean copies of your resume and two copies of your reference list.             A pad of paper with a list of prepared     questions you want to ask (and for taking additional notes).            Two pens (now is not the time to find out your     only pen is out of ink).             A comb or hairbrush and a pocket mirror.             Tissues, wet naps, or a small washcloth (trust     me, these can be a lifesaver).            Toothbrush and toothpaste (especially if it is     an after-work appointment) or breath spray.             Travel-size antiperspirant (Did I or didn't I?     You can never be too sure).             Umbrella (if there is any potential for rain).             Women: an extra pair of pantyhose or clear nail     polish for quick repair. Men: an extra tie.             Correct change for parking, if necessary.              Final Preparation                Re-read all the information you have gathered     about the company and re-read your prepared questions.               Practice your interview responses to tough     questions (best if done out loud). I've compiled a   long list of commonly asked tough   interview questions  for you to become familiar with the types of   questions you'll be asked, and to help you prepare your responses. In   addition, If you'd like me to e-mail you a file on some of the     toughest interview questions  and their best responses :       e-mail     Sue Campbell     -  it's free!  Or try the  online   interview questions quiz  and see how you do.            Make time to relax, even if it's just for     10 minutes, and do positive affirmation exercises (envision yourself working for this     company and envision a positive outcome to the interview).             Continue to give yourself positive messages     throughout the day (""I'm a great candidate for this position” - “I can make     a positive difference in this company"").             Get a good night's sleep, and get up earlier     than normal for early morning appointments, so that you have plenty of time before the     interview to get ready and relax.            Take a leisurely walk if you find yourself     feeling overwhelmed with pre-interview jitters.             Eat well (do not skip meals!), and avoid foods     that commonly disagree with you.             Even if your interview appointment is scheduled     for your lunch hour, prepare to take something with you that can be eaten beforehand. Dry     cereal and a bottle of water will work in a pinch to stop stomach noises and nervous     stomach acid.             Confirm that baby sitters will arrive on time,     and have a back up plan if this fails.             Have backup transportation.            Make certain any other responsibilities are     accounted for, in case the interview runs longer than you assumed (clear your schedule,     etc.).            For people who suffer from sweaty palms during     stressful situations, apply antiperspirant followed by foot or body powder to the palms of     your hands, and blot with a facial tissue or cloth (to remove any excess). Really, this     works.             Okay, This Is It!      You have arrived on time. In fact, you're early. You are appropriately dressed. You have memorized every piece of information on this company you could lay your hands on. You have honed your communication skills to perfection. You know what you are looking for and what you have to offer. You have contacted your references and they are ready and prepared to come to your aid. You have your ""Thank you"" cards at home with postage stamps affixed. You have all the necessary items with you (resume copies, references, pad of paper, pens, prepared questions, etc.), and you have a winning attitude.       Like an actor preparing for a theater performance; after the makeup artist, the lighting manager, the stage director, and the choreographer have done their part, and after the actor (you) has learned his or her lines to perfection . . . opening night comes and the actor steps out on the stage, confident that he or she is ready to put into action all that he or she has learned in preparation for this moment.           Worth a review:  Equal  Employment Opportunity Laws          ( Back  to Top )        Prep #3:      After The Interview      You've had the interview. Now it’s time for taking notes .                 Write down everything you can remember from the     interview, including:           The responsibilities of the position as you     understand them            Any key points or concerns discussed at the     interview (particularly any deficits noted)            Specific goals of the company and/or       company projects for which the position is responsible            Names of key personnel in the company (and the     correct spelling and pronunciation)            Any other issues or information you have     learned about the company or interviewer that is of value             Contacting Your References      Contact each of your references to let him or her know that a call will be coming and from whom (name of interviewer / name of company). Tell each of your references about the position (title and responsibilities) and any key areas that need to be addressed - What is the interviewer trying to secure in potential candidates for the position?      Writing The ""Thank you"" Letter      A ""Thank you"" card should be sent within 24 hours following an interview. It's preferable to send an actual card, rather than a letter (more personable), handwritten - if your handwriting is neat and legible.      You should send a ""Thank you"" card to each individual involved in your interview.       Include the following in your letter:           Your interviewer's name (and correct spelling).     If there was more than one interviewer, each should receive his or her own personalized     thank you letter.            Key points discussed during the interview.     These should include the objective of the position you're targeting, the goal and mission     of company or department, and any special concerns or considerations discussed.            Any positive contributions you feel your     particular skills and experience will bring to this particular company's goals and     missions (including any that were actually discussed during the interview).             For more information, read my article on  Thank You Letters      Preparing For The Next Interview      The initial interview may not have resulted in the guarantee of a position, so you need to be prepared for the next interview, whether it's a second interview with this company or an initial interview with another company.      Your interview clothing needs to be cleaned and prepared for the next opportunity. For second interviews, a second interview dress needs to be made ready (this doesn't have to be an entirely new outfit, it can simply be a different shirt, tie, blouse or skirt worn with the same basic suit).       For  second interviews , a new list of questions and responses need to be prepared. Take what you've learned from the first interview (including any questions or concerns you or the interviewer may have expressed) and formulate a plan. What answers do you need to secure? How can you reduce the interviewer's concerns during round two? What types of solutions can you suggest? What problems can you solve? Used what you've learned from this interview to avoid any potential pitfalls in interviews with new companies, too.      If you've exhausted your resume copies, it's time to have new ones printed.      Until a job offer has been presented AND you've accepted it, your job search isn't over. Keep submitting resumes, polishing your interview skills, and being prepared for the next opportunity.

However, in deciding whether or not to write a thank          you letter, you should keep in mind the fact that the interview process          is largely guided by impressions. The feelings, positive or negative,          that the members of a search committee form about your character will go          a long way towards helping them to make their hiring decision. As a          result, any chance you have to show the search committee that you are a          wellindividual should not be ignored. While there are many          opportunities during the interview process to show off your good          character, the thank you letter is often the last chance that you will          have to clue the search committee in to the fact that you are the person          whom they should hire, so it is important to make this opportunity          count!                       As is often the case for so much in          life, there is more than one right way to write a thank you letter. The          following guidelines are what have worked well during my foray into the          library science job market. However, while the tips listed below are          based largely on my experiences, I also worked hard to include          additional advice from career counselors, professional librarians,          employment-related websites, and conversations on e-mail lists such as          NEXGENLIB-L.             Why send a thank          you letter?                     Sending a thank you letter is a great          way to show a search committee that you are a conscientious and          thoughtful person, two characteristics that all employers look for. The          fact that you took the time to write (and thank you letters do not take          much time to write, so this will not be an overly burdensome task) will          also reinforce the idea that you are a professional who is very          interested in the position being offered, especially if other candidates          fail to thank the search committee for their interviews. Thank you          letters can also serve grander purposes. They present you with an          opportunity to correct a mistake or repair a misunderstanding that          occurred during your interview. They allow you one last opportunity to          sell yourself to the search committee. Finally, thank you letters also          allow you to create a dialog with one or more of the search committee          members, giving you additional opportunities to sell both yourself and          your credentials.                      While you may think that sending a thank          you letter is akin to issing up,this is not the case. The thank you          letter is a professional courtesy and an opportunity to reconnect with          the members of the search committee and promote yourself, nothing more.           However, sending flowers or gifts to the search committee after your          interview is something that you should never do during your job search.          It is in poor taste and it also makes you look desperate, which will in          turn make the search committee less likely to hire you.            Who should be          sent a thank you letter?           If you have been interviewed          by a search committee, it is best if you send a letter to each committee          member individually, rather than writing one letter addressed to the          entire committee or only to the committee head. Sending individual          letters gives your letter a more personal feel and enables you to form a          connection with each member of the committee. If you have forgotten the          names of the search committee members during the stress of the          interview, it is perfectly acceptable to ask for their names again at          the end of the interview and write those names down. Just make sure to          check that you are spelling the names correctly! Finally, if you met at          length with other individuals who were not on the search committee, it          is polite to send those individuals a thank you note as well.            When to send          your thank you letter           Thank you letters          should be sent after a face-to-face interview, but they can also be sent          after a phone interview. Personally, I have sent thank you notes during          both the phone and face-to-face stages of the interview process. I see          no problem with sending out multiple thank you notes for one position,          particularly when you are meeting with different people during each          stage of the interview process.            You should send          your thank you letter out as soon as possible after the interview,          preferably within 24 hours. However, this can vary depending on the          timeline given to you by the members of the search committee as to when          they will be making their decision, so make sure to ask for this          information if it is not given to you at the end of your interview. If          the committee is going to be making its final decision later that day, a          thank you letter will probably not do you much good. However, if this is          the first of several interviews, sending the letter can only reflect          well on you should you be chosen for a follow up interview. If the          committee will not be making their decision for several days or weeks          you can wait a few days before sending the letter, but don wait too          long. I have found that if I put this task off, even for a day, it tends          to never get done. If, like me, you have trouble remembering to send          your letter after the stress of an interview, it may be a good idea to          leave yourself a note as a reminder. In any case, whenever you do decide          to send your letter, make sure that it will arrive before the search          committee announces its decision, and check your e-mail and phone          messages before you send the letter. As I have learned from personal          experience, it can be awkward to send your letter after you have already          been notified of the search committee decision.             How to send your          thank you letter                     I use the term hank you letter,but          your thank you letter is much more likely to be a thank you -mail,         especially if you are dealing with time sensitive conditions where a          decision will be made rather quickly. E-mail is an accepted form of          communication, and many search committees even communicate with their          candidates or send out notices of their hiring decisions using e-mail.          However, when using e-mail to communicate in a professional environment,          you must make sure to format the e-mail in a professional manner. You          can format an e-mail in the same way that you would format a paper          business letter (refer to a writing manual if you need a refresher on          formal letter writing), but at the very least you should include an          appropriate greeting (Dear Mr./Ms.) and salutation (Sincerely). Also          remember to proofread your letter rather than relying totally on          spell-check to catch your mistakes.                      On the other hand, if you are absolutely          confident that you have the time, a professional looking letter sent          through the mail, either typed or handwritten on quality paper, is          highly recommended. Handwritten letters are particularly desirable          because they convey a personal touch that is rare these days, and is          thus usually appreciated.  However, if you have sloppy handwriting as I          do, stick to a typed letter. Also, do not forget to sign your letters!             What to say in          your thank you letter                     Thank you letters should be kept short,          a paragraph or two at most, because the majority of the people you send          your letters to will not want to take the time to read a longer letter.          It is perfectly fine to write a thank you letter that is only a few          sentences long. In this letter you can thank the individual for taking          the time to meet with you, let them know that you enjoyed learning about          their institution and its goals, and remind them that you remain very          interested in their position.                     If at all possible, try to personalize          the letters you are writing. When you meet with people during an          interview try to jot down their names and a unique fact about each          person, and then use those facts in your letters. For example, if one of          the committee members is currently in charge of developing their          library marketing plan, you can mention the marketing class you took          as an undergraduate in college.                       You can also use the thank you letter to          address something that you feel did not go well during the interview. If          the search committee had a concern about your candidacy, you can address          that in your letter by acknowledging their concern followed by an          explanation as to why this particular issue will not be a problem based          on evidence from your resume and past experiences. If you answered a          particular question poorly during your interview, it is also perfectly          fine to rethink your answer in a thank you letter and let the search          committee know that upon further consideration your answer has          changed/expanded.                     It is also a good idea to include a          sentence or two in your letter designed to sell yourself and remind the          search committee of your strengths as a candidate. However, you should,          if possible, base what you say on what was discussed during the          interview. Take notes during the interview, if you can, to make this          task easier. For example, if the search committee seemed to focus on the          web page design class you took during your graduate studies and the need          that their library has for someone with this skill set, you could          mention in your letter that you believe your experience in this area          would be a valuable asset to their library. Many people feel          uncomfortable promoting themselves in this manner. However,          self-marketing is a necessary skill to have in the professional world,          so it is probably a good idea to start practicing now. Just remember to          keep things short and simple! While advice columns for those in the          corporate or business world greatly stress the concept of selling          yourself, I don believe this is as important in the field of library          science as it is in other fields.                     Finally, in writing a thank you letter          you have the opportunity to open a dialog with one or more of the          individuals you send letters to by asking them a question in the letter          related to the job or to a topic that was discussed during your          interview. If you can keep this discussion going for a little while you          will have additional opportunities to connect with this individual and          to sell yourself to them. However, be careful not to overstay your          welcome by keeping the conversation going after the other person has          brought it to a close.            Remember:            Thank you letters should not only be          sent to prospective employers, but also to those individuals who have          helped you with your job search or acted as your references. Sending          letters to these individuals thanking them for their help after you have          found a job is professional courtesy, and it also helps to reinforce the          positive impression your references and friends have of you. Besides,          you may need the help of these individuals later on, so network while          you can and send them a thank you letter, and perhaps another letter          letting them know how you are doing in your new job after you have been          there for a little while.

clueweb09-en0009-82-01791	                Job Interview Thank You Letters  You should write a thank you letter as soon as possible (within 24 hours is recommended) after the job interview, at a minimum this should be done through email but is recommended that you do this through a hard-copy of a letter printed out of your computer which can be sent in through the postal mail or faxed in.  Hand written notes on thank you cards are also acceptable and good for short thank you notes.   A hard-copy thank you letter should be written in the  business letter format , while an email should be sent in the same format but without the heading (your return address, their address, and the date).    Thank you letter writing  The first paragraph should consist of thanking the interviewer for the interviewing you (remind him/her about the position you interviewed for and the date of your interview).   You can also include information about your impressions about the company.   The second paragraph should state your interests in the company and include any additional information about yourself that was not brought up in the interview which would make you a good candidate for the position.  You can also emphasize your qualifications that were already discussed during the interview (don't make this paragraph too long, try to keep it between 3-5 sentences, pick the traits that you think were most important to the interviewer and emphasize them).   The last paragraph should let the recruiter know that you expect to hear from them soon.  Also let them know that you are available to come in again and are willing to discuss the job further.  Write down your contact information again and what the best method and/or time to contact you is.  To finish up the letter, thank them again for the interview.    Notes/Tips   A thank you letter shows that you have good business etiquette, your interest in the company and the position, and reiterates your positive qualifications to the interviewer so it should not be put off.    If there was more than one interviewer; write individual thank you letters to each of the interviewers (make sure each letter is unique).  If it was a panel of interviewers interviewing you at the same time, you can send out one letter and address it to the head interviewer and the interview panel and thank them as one group.    If you forget the spelling or the names of the interviewers, simply call the company and request the proper spelling and title.    Keep the thank you letter brief; make sure the letter does not go past one page in length.    Check for proper grammar usage and spelling.

It is critical, but very few job seekers actually do it. What  is it? The THANK YOU NOTE! Interview  experts agree that EVERY job hunter MUST send thank-you notes after EVERY interview.  They also point out that most people completely ignore this bit of wisdom. In  order to have a huge advantage over the other candidates for the job you want,  send thank-you notes to EVERYONE you meet the day of the interview—administrative  assistants, managers, interviewers, people you met who already do the job you  are targeting, and so on. One  of my resume clients (let's call him Mike) is a Certified Arborist and Tree Care  Professional in the San Diego area. His goal is to move into the consulting arena. Very  soon after speaking on the phone with the owner of a prominent tree care company,  Mike mailed a brief note thanking the owner for his time and consideration. Within  a week, the owner called Mike and offered him an informal mentoring arrangement  to help Mike learn more about the consulting side of tree care.                   ""Sending a thank-you   note demonstrates that  you are good with people.   You employ the most   basic of people skills—a   show of gratitude...""            Mike  decided to pass on the offer and continue his job search, and he recently landed  a very nice position. He sent me an e-mail about his recent job-hunting activities  saying, ""...and just so you know, the thank-you letter has got to be the block  that keeps the door open. I sent out three letters and subsequently got three  offers."" If you're  not convinced yet, the following reasons outline the significance of sending thank-you  notes:  (1) Sending  a thank-you note demonstrates that you are good with people. You employ the most  basic of people skills—a show of gratitude. (2)  It helps companies remember you after the interview. You can restate your interest  in the position, especially if the interview went well. (3)  You can use the thank-you note to summarize a few of the main points discussed  at the interview. You can also add anything you forgot to tell them. (4)  It has the potential to increase your affinity with those who have the authority  to hire you. (5)  It shows that you are serious about your career design. (6)  It indicates that you are organized and on top of details. (7)  It demonstrates that you went out of your way to show interest in the company  and/or position. (8)  If they decide not to consider you for the position, perhaps they know of another  opportunity that suits you. You can mention this in the thank-you note, asking  them to keep you in mind. The  post-interview thank-you note doesn't have to be fancy. Here's an example: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Thank  you for the opportunity to speak with you today. As we discussed, my 10-years  of outside sales experience is a perfect fit for XYZ Widgets as you expand into  the Pacific Rim. In light of your plans for Asia, you?ll find my Japanese language  skills to be of great value. Feel  free to contact me at 555-1234 should you have additional questions. I am very  interested in the position. Thank  you again for your time and consideration.  Regards, Jane  Doe ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ OK.  You now know the impact a thank-you note can have after an employment interview.  Are there other opportunities to send them? Absolutely!  The general rule is this: After  ANYONE has done you even the smallest favor during the job-hunt/career-design  process, send the individual a thank-you note. Was  a receptionist at a company you phoned while doing research exceptionally helpful?  Did one of your colleagues take five minutes to help you with a cover letter?  Did somebody who already does the job you want to do provide you with some valuable  insights? The job hunt can be frustrating. Was someone particularly encouraging? You  should send each of these individuals a brief hand-written thank-you note expressing  your gratitude for their time and assistance. To  reiterate: A thank-you note goes to everyone who helps you, gives you leads, or  provides advice or guidance even in the most infinitesimal way. That includes  friends, people at companies or organizations you've visited while doing your  research, temp agency personnel, administrative assistants, receptionists, librarians,  company employees...ANYONE! Here  are a few thank-you note guidelines: -  Address the note to the specific individual with which you spoke. Personalize  it. Avoid an obligatory, mechanical tone. Mention something about your conversation  or how the individual treated you. -  Thank-you notes following an interview should be printed out on quality stationery  with letterhead matching that of your resume. Remember to sign it!  -  A conservative, handwritten thank-you card is appropriate for all those friends,  colleagues, and casual contacts that have helped you along the way.  -  Send thank-you notes the very next day, at the latest. If it arrives a week later,  the meaning is lost. -  If you e-mail a sentiment of gratitude, follow up with a thank-you note or card  in the mail. Use  your best judgment—these are just guidelines. The  thank-you note is critical to your getting noticed and to the success of your  job hunt. And because most folks either forget or just plain don't do it, you'll  find yourself at a significant advantage.     About the Author...    Copyright Peter Hill, CPRW--Honolulu, Hawaii,  U.S.A.
