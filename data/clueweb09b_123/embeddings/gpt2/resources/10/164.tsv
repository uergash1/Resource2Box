The thighbone (femur), shinbone (tibia) and kneecap (patella) make up the knee. Cartilage and membranes protect the surfaces of these bones. Arthritis and injury can damage the knee, making it difficult to walk and causing pain. In total knee replacement the surgeon makes an incision in the knee area, removes the damaged cartilage and bone and fixes new metal and plastic surfaces to the thighbone, shinbone and kneecap.

All-state directories       are also available. Files are provided in either PDF format or as       Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet) files. The Excel files are useful for       mail merge and label creation as well as sorting the information in       different ways. For an explanation of terms used in the directories (not       just for CBRFs), see the  CBRF Legend   (PDF       10kb) . Also note that prices listed  may be different  from       what facilities are currently charging; always call facilities to confirm       their rates.        Information for these directories       comes from databases updated by staff in the Bureau of Quality Assurance       Regional offices.  Management and staff for assisted living       facilities or providers should contact the appropriate   Regional       Office   to inform them of changes.         While information is updated       daily, directories will be posted quarterly (or monthly for CBRFs and       adult family homes).         PDF files can be viewed and       printed using  Acrobat       Reader (free download site)   (exit DHFS) .         All-state CBRF and AFH directories       have bookmarks to aid searching. Click on the Navigation Pane icon in Acrobat       Reader, then select Bookmarks to view an alphabetical marker list for the       counties.         The Excel versions (spreadsheet) will require Microsoft       Excel or any spreadsheet program that can read Excel 95 or 97.

Although this Q&A system has been designed for maximum flexibility, you may find that you can't get what you want by forming and executing just one query. When this is the case, use a series of simpler queries. There is no limit on the number of queries you may submit.      Go to the  Top  of the page.
