I promise I will ask Ron for this information. It is such a timely article, I wanted to go ahead and share it. Happy Hoofing!      Summertime weather spells potential problems for horses in Georgia and the surrounding south.  Years ago I realized the overall condition of horse feet improved in winter and deteriorated in summer. Let's look at why it happens.   Many barn managers turn out at night during hot weather for obvious reasons: no flies, the sun doesn't bleach hair coats, and frolicking all night keeps them quieter during the day. This summer ""program"" seems very good, yet there is a down side to this regimen of care. During summer evenings, grass is very wet with dew. When horses are out all night their hooves stay wet most of the night. While during the day, the horses are stalled in shavings, worked in sand rings, and generally kept in dry conditions. The exposure to moisture during the night causes the hooves to swell slightly, while during the day moisture evaporates, and they dry out and shrink. The shoes stay the same size throughout. Think about that fact!    To compound the problem, horses have to contend with flies during the day. They in turn stomp their feet.  Foot stomping isnt' so bad if they are shod with stout steel shoes with clips. With the horses wearing training plates (light steel), Queens plates, or aluminum wide webs, a condition may emerge which I call ""Summer Syndrome"". Depending upon the severity of your horse's problems, some trade-off's may be necessary:   1. Eliminate night turn-out, substitute several shorter day periods.   2. Shoe with pads (although pads hold moisture against the sole of the foot, they also keep the moisture constant!).   3. Shoe with steel instead of aluminum. (If your horse moves better in aluminum, then have your farrier spring temper, harden, light steel shoes for summer.)   4. Switch to titanium wide webs during the summer. (Titanium is very hard, yet very light and an excellent replacement for aluminum. Considerably more expensive, yet titanium can be set several more times.)   5. Use fly repellent daily to reduce foot stomping to a minimum.    We have defined the problem, cause and effects, and discussed some mechanical and managerial options as solutions. Now let's look at some topical applications that can help.   I have been shoeing for 30 years and I have tried all the gimmicks and keep coming back to good logic to solve problems. The periople at the coronary band of a horse's hoof secretes a wax-like substance much like what a duck uses on his feathers when preening. On a horse's hoof it is unmistakable. It is the natural, healthy shine we see on barefooted pasture horses. The wax is a way of preserving a moisture balance within the hoof. Naturally! On the other hand, we alter our horse's environment, rasp on their hoof walls, and expose their feet to abrasives, (sand, granite dust, etc.). Obviously, none of these are natural. To compensate, we use hoof dressing, and some are good -- some are useless!  Years ago, I discovered paste floor wax worked as a moisture barrier. But I had my doubts about the compatability of the chemicals with horses' hooves. The best hoof dressing I have found have a high wax content. The four brands that are best formulated to provide hoof seal are:  1. Corona Ointment and Corona Liquified Hoof Dressing by Summit Industries.  2. Hoof Maker by Straight Arrow.  3. Hoof Saver by Farnam  4. Vita-Hoof by Race Horse Veterinary Products.   These products all provide excellent protection against excess moisture in the hooves.   I recommended avoiding petroleum based products in the summer months. These are more soluable in water and attract dirt. Hoof dressings should be applied, then wiped dry (or to a wax-like shine) on the exterior hoof wall. Dressings should be applied more liberally on the sole and the frog of the hoof where most of the moisture is absorbed. Hoof dressings are most effective when used just prior to the night turn-out, hosing, bathing, or anytime your horse's hooves will be exposed to excessive moisture.    We have talked about ""Summer Syndrome"" and its causes. The two questions I am most commonly asked are: ""Does my horse have thrush?"" and ""Are my horse's feet too dry?"" My answer is ""YOUR HORSE'S FEET ARE TOO WET!"" We'll leave the question of thrush for another article.    Obviously, hooves do get too dry in drought conditions or on high ground clay turn-out where there is little grass. This situation is more uncommon than over-moist hooves. It is important that hoof dressings do not soften hooves, at best they maintain moisture already present in the hoof.   When hooves are too dry, we need to provide a source of moisture. The most effective way to do this is to poultice the feet. Poultice powder mixed with water to the consistency of thick oatmeal is best. The poultice can be pre-mixed in a plastic pail and sealed with saran wrap for later use. A hand full applied to each sole of each hoof, then covered with with some type of wrap or poultice boot to keep the moisture securely against the hoof, will provide treatment for the dry hooves. Another way to poultice the feet is to put the mixture into a breadbag or a ziplock bag and slide the hoof into the bag and tape securely around the pastern. A handful of poultice on each foot covered with a square of brown paper will also work (Poultice will stick to the hoof, paper will stick to the poultice but not the bedding). Enough poultice will remain on the hoof to provide necessary moisture. It is best to use poultice when the horse will be confined in a stall for several hours. Hooves will absorb moisture and soften after several days of treatment. Once moisture is regained, then use the wax-based hoof dressing daily to maintain moisture in the hoof.   In conclusion, many factors influence the hoof health factor: nutrition, conformation, hoof substance, farrier care, and stable management. Given all of the above at acceptable levels, moisture content is still critical. Remember, water softens dry hooves and wax maintains the moisture balance.

Eco-Organizing: Domestic Diva, Krista Colvin, Shows You How to Be Green and Gorgeous in 2009                          Written by  Gennefer Snowfield             Published  on January 4th, 2009       1 Comment           Posted  in  Feelgood Style ,   Interviews ,   decor                       One of the biggest challenges most people face is staying organized. It’s also one of the biggest new year’s resolutions for those who resolve to start their new year off clutter-free. But, for many, it’s an elusive process that either starts off strong and fizzles out, or seems so daunting a task that they don’t know where to begin.     Enter  Krista Colvin ,lifestyle expert,Founder of  Organize in Style LLC and creator of  The Shebang , The Smart Woman’s Guide to Doing It All,who seesyour clutter as a canvas for crafting a well organized masterpiece that’s as eco-friendly as it is stylish.Bestof all,she offers practicalsolutions thatare easy to implement — and maintain — and willsave you precious hours to boot. With Krista’s help, the only thing you’ll need to think about is what to do with all that extra time!       »  Read more on Feelgood Style        You are an organizing diva, and manage the Organize in Style blog in addition to creating The Shebang, The Smart Woman’s Guide to Doing it All. How did you get into organizing and what do you love most about it?    After teaching high school for 13 years, I decided to take what I dubbed my “Domestic Diva” leave of absence. A year into it, I got antsy. It was while watching HGTV that I discovered professional organizing as a profession. From there I launched Organize in Style, my consulting and hands-on organizing business then later developed The Shebang!, my online lifestyle management program. I love the instant gratification clients feel, plusexpress. They say thank you immediately vs. my high school students. It usually took them till graduation or their 1st quarter at college!   Why do you think it’s so difficult for people to stay organized? What’s the one main tip you offer clients to help them remain focused in their organizing efforts?   Its difficult to stay organized because we are busy living life to its fullest! We are constantly bringing items into our homesand offices. Think of clutter as just a pile of decisions you have yet to make. The key to staying organized is to make those decisions. Sometimes those decisions are quick and easy while other items require more thought. But make at least some decisions every day.   Is there a secret to being a successful organizer?   Successful organizers create personalized systems for their clients. I believe everyone has their own organizing style and a Stepford approach to organizing just doesnt cut it. I also believe that people are secretly afraid of professional organizers because they think we will throw everything away. Au contraire! We simply press you to answer your own questions i.e.; Do I really need/use/cherish this? Its far from scary and clients quickly comment that its actually fun. I know fun isnt what youd thought, now is it? But its true… I guarantee it!   Your blog talks about how being organized is a lifestyle that can help you effectively manage all areas of your life — and that you can do it in style. Do you have any specific areas on which you focus? What’s the biggest challenge that typically prompts people to seek the services of a professional organizer like you?   The Shebang focuses on getting it, pluskeeping it together amongst all things SHE& self | home | personal/professional endeavors. I believe you can do it all, just not in 1 day or 1 week& but we want to do it all  now . Its the perfectionist in us and the desire for instant gratification. Having a plan takes the overwhelm out of getting organized, and sets you on a course for achieving your goals.   The majority of my new clients call when they are ready to take their business — or their home –to the next level. An entrepreneur may be in their 3rd year of business or have recently moved into a new space. Another client may be fed up with the lack of systems in their home or want to make their space function and look fabulous. But the biggest issue is always paper& paper, paper, paper. “Help! I’m drowning in paper!”   Our readers embrace a green lifestyle. Do your services include eco-friendly tips and tricks for organizing stylishly — and responsibly?   The first step is getting to know the clients organizing — and personal  style. Then comes the fun part — getting creative with the use of out of the box storage items. I love using vintage items to organize. A tea cup can serve as a paperclip holder. An old metal cash box can become a bill box.” Look for items that can be used for incoming mail or magazine and catalog holders. An old bread box can be a clever way to hide your kitchen office clutter –i.e. pens, scissor, pad of paper etc. I did a  segment  on organizing with vintage items that offers more great tips as part of a reuse/recycle approach to organizing.   What green organizing tips can you share? Is this a big part of your business?   Being green is integrated intomy basic organizingprocess:   Know what youve got.   I love it when a client says happily, Ive been looking for that. Tts much better than hearing Dang, I couldnt find this so I bought a new one last week.   Use what you have.   Gather up all the  full shampoos, gels, etc. Place them in a shower caddy and use them up. Try to see how many meals you can conjure up with the food in your fridge, freezer, and pantry.   Make a “love it or leave it” basket.   Your girlfriends or babysitter may love the smell of the lotion you loathe or adore the stationary you no longer fancy. Give them easy access and feel good about your decision to let it go.   Spread the love.   The old camera, old phone, old sheets, and so on and so on are perfectly good, but they arent good to anyone sitting in the closet. Pick your favorite charitable recipient and make a monthly visit.   Isnt that lovely?”   Get in the habit of not bringing the “lovelies” home. Instead, try picking up the item, and in your best sweet drawl, utter adoringly,oh, isnt that lovely then gently placing it back down and keep smiling as you walk away!   What are some of the benefits of being organized? What areas of the house do you think offer the greatest benefits?   Being organized allows you to dream big dreams! Once youve got the little things under control, you can tackle the big items that come your way. And of course, save oodles of time and money.   Think of the areas you use on a daily basis. Organize these first and youll free up time while feeling less anxious. Mail centers and often used spaces like the bathroom, kitchen andpantry fall into this category.   Your services extend beyond basic room organization to crafts and meal planning — and even TO DO lists and entertaining. Why did you decide to take this comprehensive approach? Do clients engage you for specific services or do you offer a total package?   After completing projects with clients, I realized they were anxious to keep their spaces looking and feeling fabulous and functional. They wanted a plan. An  easy  plan. Its not just stuff that overwhelms people… its life, the over committing, the perfection misconception, and trying to entertain on a 5-star level. Having a plan where you know you will focus on all these areas in a particular time frame — and with a particular,  achievable –  goal in mindwill take a majority of the stress out of it.   Most projects begin with a consultation which includes creating an overall plan for their space. Together, we determine where to start and where my help is most needed vs. the DIY list. I prefer to focus on one area at a time, allowing the client time to adjust to, and feel comfortable managing,the newly implemented system.   Are there certain times of the year (like New Year’s!) or life events (such as getting married, moving etc.) that prompt people to contact you? Do you have a particular time of year or life event that you recommend is a good time to start getting organized that offers the greatest chance of sticking with it?     Im not sure if its the media hype or the fact that we are so over all the holiday dcor that creates the New Year organizing craze. But its definitely a time when people are seeking information. About 2 weeks into January, the calls really start flooding in. People just want it done and don’t have the time or patience for the DIY phase. Transitional periods, whether it be moving or having a 2nd child or taking a business to the next , typically prompts a majority ofcalls.   But anytime is a good time to start. Your success depends on the system youve chosen to implement. The more simple the system the more likely you are to stick with it.         What’s your dream organizing job? Do you have visions of being the next Martha Stewart? Where do you hope to take your expertise?   Ooooh, my dream job. Id love to consult with builders and have them implement my savvy storage solutions into their homes, and feature them in the models.   As far as being Martha Stewart, I did before I had kids! Now Im much more Erma (as in Bombeck) sprinkled with a touch of Martha glitter. Visions of Martha make me feel like I need to be perfect and frankly, I lock my keys in my car every so often so I just aim to be the best  me !   Id love to design organizing products and have my own little cable show. The products would be functional and fabulous and the show& well, it would have to include coffeeand my girlfriends, two of the essentials I can not live without. Oh, and lipstick!   If readers could only focus on ONE organizing effort in 2009, what would you recommend it be?     Create simple routines andschedules&not necessarily to be so rigid andfollowed to a T but as a base for staying sane!   How can readers get in touch with you if they want to contract your services?

clueweb09-en0002-38-17927	   TopEndSports     home  |   testing  |  fitness     This is the mobile version of the website. Go here for the complete   Topendsports.com  site    Sit and Reach Flexibility    This test measures the flexibility of the lower back and hamstring muscles.             equipment required:  sit and reach box (or alternatively a ruler can    be used, and held between the feet)          description / procedure:  This test involves sitting        on the floor with legs out straight ahead. Feet (shoes off) are        placed with the soles flat against the box, shoulder-width apart. Both knees are held flat against        the floor by the tester. With hands on top  of each other and  palms facing down, the subject reaches forward along the  measuring line as far as possible. After three practice reaches, the fourth  reach is held for at least two seconds while the distance is recorded.  Make        sure there is no jerky movements, and that the fingertips remain    level and the legs flat.     scoring:  The score is recorded to the nearest centimeter as the distance before      (negative) or beyond (positive) the toes. Rating   scores (in cm) for adults, using zero at the level of the feet, are for males > +17 excellent, +6 to +16 good, 0 to +5 average, -8 to -1 fair, -19 to -9 poor and < -20 very poor. For females, > +21 excellent, +11 to +20 good, +1 to +10 average, -7 to 0 fair, -14 to -8 poor and < -15 very poor.          validity:  This tests only measures the flexibility of      the lower back and hamstrings, and is a valid measure of this.           reliability:  The reliability will depends on the amount      of warm-up allowed, and whether the same procedures are followed      each time. Most norms are based on no previous warm-up, though the best results will be achieved after a warm up or if the test is proceeded by a test such as the endurance test.          advantages:  This is the most commonly used test of flexibility,      so there is lots of data for comparison. Also, it is a       easy and quick test to perform.          disadvantages:  Variations in arm, leg and trunk length      can make comparisons between individuals misleading. The best measures are made with a measurement box specifically made for this test, which is not readily available.  This test is specific to the range of motion and muscles and joints of the lower back and hamstrings.           other comments:  Lower back flexibility is important      because tightness in this area is implicated in lumbar lordosis,      forward pelvic tilt and lower back pain.     back to  fitness test database     (7) Home    |  (8) Testing  |  (9) Fitness            
clueweb09-enwp01-56-17042	"                     Horse hoof          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (January 2008)                 This article  may require  cleanup  to meet Wikipedia's  quality standards .  Please  improve this article  if you can.  (January 2009)              Barefoot hoof, lateral view. Cornet band (1), walls (2), toe (3), quarter (4), heel (5), bulb (6), P2 (small pastern) (7)       A  horse hoof  is a structure surrounding the distal  phalanx  of the 3rd digit (digit III of the basic  pentadactyl limb  of  vertebrates , evolved into a single weight-bearing digit in equids) of each of the four limbs of  Equus  species, which is covered by complex soft tissue and  keratinised  (cornified) structures. Since a single digit must bear the full proportion of the animal's weight that is borne by that limb, the hoof is of vital importance to the horse. The phrase ""no hoof, no horse"" underlines how much the health and the strength of the hoof is crucial for horse soundness.   Both wild and feral equid hooves have enormous strength and resilience, allowing any gait on any ground. A common example of the feral horse type is the  Mustang . The Mustang is, in part, descended from the  Iberian horses  brought to the Americas by the  Spanish , but most herds also have ancestry from other breeds. Therefore, the famous mustang hoof strength is in part a result of  natural selection  and environment. Thus, it is possible that other domestic breeds could develop similar hooves if raised under similar conditions.   The recent  barefoot movement  claims that such a strength can be almost completely restored to domesticated horses, when appropriate trimming and living conditions are applied, to such an extent that  horseshoes  are no longer necessary in almost any horse. This is not an unopposed view but, if true, would undermine the belief that ""the horseshoe is a necessary evil.""

Details: heel perioplium (1), bulb (2), frog (3), central groove (4), collateral groove (5), heel (6), bar (7), seat of corn (8), pigmented walls (external layer) (9), water line (inner layer) (10), white line (11), apex of frog (12), sole (13), toe (14), how to measure width (15), quarter (16), how to measure length (17)       The hoof is made up by an outer part, the hoof capsule (composed of various cornified specialised structures) and an inner, living part, containing soft tissues and bone. The cornified material of the hoof capsule is different in structure and properties in different parts. Dorsally, it covers, protects and supports P3 (also known as the coffin bone,  pedal bone , PIII). Palmarly/plantarly, it covers and protects specialised soft tissues (tendons, ligaments, fibro-fatty and/or fibrocartilaginous tissues and cartilage). The upper, almost circular limit of the hoof capsule is the coronet (coronary band), having an angle to the ground of roughly similar magnitude in each pair of feet (i.e. fronts and backs). These angles may differ slightly from one horse to the other but not markedly. The walls originate from the coronet band. Walls are longer in the dorsal portion of the hoof (toe), intermediate in length in the lateral portion (quarter) and very short in palmar/plantar portion (heel). Heels are separated by an elastic, resilient structure named the 'frog'. In the palmar/plantar part of the foot, above the heels and the frog, there are two oval bulges named the 'bulbs'.   When you pick up the hoof and you look at its lower surface, you can see the wall's free margin, encircling most of the hoof. In the central area, you can see the triangular frog. Lateral to the frog, are two grooves, deeper in their posterior portion, named 'collateral grooves'. At the heels, the palmar/plantar portion of the walls bend inwards sharply, following the external surface of collateral grooves; here they are named bars. The lower surface of the hoof, from the outer walls and the inner frog and bars, is covered by an exfoliating keratinised material, called the 'sole'.   Just below the coronet, the walls are covered for about an inch by a cornified, opaque material named the 'periople'. In the palmar/plantar part of the hoof, the periople is thicker and more rubbery over the heels and it merges with frog material. Not all horses have the same amount of periople. Dry feet tend to lack this substance, which can be substituted with Hoof Dressing.     [ edit ]   Characters and functions of the external hoof structures          A horse's hoof being leveled by a  farrier  who is using a  rasp .         [ edit ]   The walls   The walls are to be considered both as a protective shield, covering the sensitive internal hoof tissues, just like the  exoskeleton  of  arthropods , and as a structure devoted to dissipating the energy of concussion and to provide grip on different terrains. They are elastic and very tough, similar to a teflon layer; its thickness is approximately 6 mm - 12 mm. The walls are composed of three distinct layers: the pigmented layer, the water line and the white line.   The  pigmented layer  is generated by the coronet and its color is just like that of the coronet skin whence it is derived. If the coronet skin has any dark patch, the walls show a parallel pigmented line, from the coronet to the ground, showing the wall's growth direction. This layer has a prevalent protective role and is not so resistant to ground contact, where it can break and flake away.   The  water line  is built up by the coronet and by the wall's corium (the living tissue immediately beneath the walls). Its thickness increases proportional to the distance from the coronet and, in the lower third of the walls, is thicker than the pigmented layer. It is very resistant to contact to the ground and it serves a mainly support function.   The  white line  is the inner layer of the wall. It is softer and fibrous in structure. Its color is yellowish. You can see it in the underside of the healthy hoof as a thin line joining the sole and the walls. The white line grows out from the laminar connections. Any visible derangement of the white line indicates some important derangement of laminar connections that fix the walls to the underlying P3 bone. Since the white line is softer than both the walls and the sole, it wears fast where it appears on the surface and it appears as a subtle groove between the sole and the walls, often with some debris or sand inside.   The three layers of the wall merge in a single mass and they grow downwards together. If the wall doesn't wear naturally, from sufficient movement on abrasive terrains, then it will protrude from the solar surface. It then becomes prone to breakage and the healthy hoof will self-trim, by breaking or chipping off.   When a horseshoe is applied, it is fixed to the wall. Nails are driven in, oblique to the walls. They enter the wall at the outside edge of the white line and they emerge at the wall's surface, approximately 15-20 mm from the base of the wall.   The wall is anatomically analogous to the human finger or toe nail.     [ edit ]   The frog   The  frog  is a heart shaped structure that extends forwards across about two-thirds of the sole. Its thickness grows from the front to the back and, at the back, it merges with the heel periople. In its midline, it has a groove, the central groove (sulcus), that extends up between the bulbs.   It is dark gray-blackish in color and of a rubbery consistency, suggesting its role as shock absorber and grip tool on hard, smooth ground. Actually, the frog acts like a pump to move the blood back to the heart, a great distance from the relatively thin leg to the main organ of the circulatory system.   In the stabled horse, the frog doesn't wear but it degrades with bacterial and fungal activity to an irregular, soft, slashed surface. In the free-roaming horse, it hardens into a callous consistency with a near-smooth surface.   It is anatomically analogous to the human fingertip.     [ edit ]   The sole   The sole has a whitish-yellowish, sometimes grayish color. It covers the whole space from the perimeter of the wall to the bars and the frog, on the underside of the hoof. Its deep layer has a compact, waxy character and it is called 'live sole'. Its surface is variable in character as a result of ground contact. If there is no contact, as in shod hooves or when the walls are too long or the movement poor, the lower surface of the sole has a crumbly consistency and it is easily abraded by scratching it with a hoofpick. Conversely, it has a very hard consistency, with a smooth, bright surface when there is a consistent, active contact with the ground. The front portion beneath the front of the pedal bone is called the 'sole callus'.     [ edit ]   The bars   They are inward folds of the wall, originating from the heels at an abrupt angle. The strong structure built up by the extremity of the heel and of the bar is named the 'heel buttress'. The sole between the heel walls and the bars is named the 'seat of corn' and it is a very important landmark used by natural hoof trimmers to evaluate the correct heel height. The bars have a three-layer structure, just like the walls (see above). When overgrown, they bend outwards and cover the lower surface of the sole.     [ edit ]   Internal structures          Sagittal section of a wild horsehoof. Pink: soft tissues; light gray: bones (P2, P3 and navicular bone); blue: tendons; red: corium; yellow: digital cushion; dark gray: frog; orange: sole; brown: walls)       The third phalanx (coffin bone;  pedal bone ; P3;) is completely (or almost completely) covered by the hoof capsule. It has a crescent shape and a lower cup-like concavity. Its external surface mirrors the wall's shape. The corium, a dermo-epidermal, highly vascularized layer between the wall and the coffin bone, has a parallel, laminar shape and is named the  laminae.  Laminar connection has a key role in the strength and the health of the hoof. Beneath the rear part of the sole, there is the  digital cushion,  which separates the frog and the bulb from underlying tendons, joints and bones, providing cushioning protection. In the foal and in the colt, the digital cushion is composed of fibro-fatty, soft tissue. In the adult horse it hardens into a fibrocartilagineous tissue, when sufficient, consistent concussion stimulates the back of the hoof. Normal transformation of the digital cushion into fibrocartilagineous tissue is now considered a key goal, both for prevention of  navicular syndrome  and for rehabilitation of recovering cases  [1] . The flexor tendon lays deeper, just along the posterior surface of the small pastern bone (PII) and navicular bone and it connects with posterior surface of P3, the navicular functioning as a pulley.     [ edit ]   The hoof mechanism          Bare hooves imprints on the snow. Left, a front print, right, a hind print; note the different shape and the wide contact with the ground       The horse hoof is not at all a rigid structure. It is elastic and flexible. Just squeezing the heels by hand will demonstrate that. When loaded, the hoof physiologically changes its shape. In part, this is a result of solar concavity, which has a variable depth, in the region of 1 - 1.5 cm. In part, it is a result of the arched shape of the lateral lower profile of the walls and sole, so that when an unloaded hoof touches a firm ground surface, there is only contact at toe and heels (active contact). A loaded hoof has a much greater area of ground contact (passive contact), covering the lower wall edge, most of the sole, bars and frog. Active contact areas can be seen as slightly protruding spots in the walls and in the callused sole.   The shape changes in a loaded hoof are complex. The plantar arch flattens, the solar concavity decreases in depth and heels spread. The hoof diameter increases to a 'dilated' configuration and P3 drops marginally into the hoof capsule. There is some recent evidence that a depression takes place in this phase, with blood pooling ('diastolic phase') mainly into the wall's corium. When unloaded, the hoof restores its 'contracted' configuration, the pressure raises and the blood is squeezed out ('systolic phase'). There is a secondary pumping action, with the flexion of the foot, as it is raised.   The hoof mechanism ensures an effective blood circulation into the hoof, and it aids general circulation, too.     [ edit ]   Time-related changes of the hoof   Hooves have to be considered as a plastic structure and their time-related, very complex changes can be considered in the short term (days/weeks), in the medium term (the horse's lifespan) and in the long term (the evolution of equids).     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the short term   Just like the cornified layer of epidermis and of any mammal nail, the hoof capsule is created only from epidermis, the outer living layer of the skin. From a microscopic point of view, epidermis is a multi-layered, specialised cornifying epithelium. It overlays the dermis and it is separated from it by a basal lamina. It has no blood vessels and living cells acquire their oxygen and nutrients by fluid exchanges and molecular diffusion, from underlying dermis, flowing into microscopical spaces among individual cells. Products of metabolism are cleared by a reverse of this process. Epidermis growth take place by  mitotic  activity in its deepest layer, into the basal layer, with slow outward migration and maturation of cells. As these cells approach the surface, special proteins accumulate into their cytoplasm, then the cells die and 'dry', into microscopic, tightly-connected individual layers, composed mainly of keratin. The resulting 'dead' superficial layer serves a protective function, saving underlying living tissues from injury, from dehydration and from fungal and bacterial attack. The constant thickness of the cornified layer results most commonly from regular superficial exfoliation. When a specialised cornified structure has a particular toughness, as in nails and hair, little or no exfoliation occurs and the cornified structures must slowly migrate away from their original position.   Thus, the specialised cornified structures of the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall doesn't exfoliate at all, It is constantly growing downward (about 1 cm per month) and self-trims by ground contact by wearing or by chipping, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and usual ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming the walls and the frog and scraping off the dead sole.     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the medium term   Front and hind hooves are identical in the foal but differ visibly in the adult horse. This is good evidence of medium-term plasticity of the whole hoof shape, as a result of variation in its use. Slow changes in hoof shape occur under any consistent change in the horse's movement pattern and under a wide variety of pathological conditions. They can be seen now as a clear example of a  complex adaptive system , a frequent feature of living beings and structures.   Self-adapting capabilities of the hooves show their maximal effectiveness in wild equids (but domesticated horses show this too, to a lesser extent), as shown by the perfect soundness of feral horses, such as  mustangs , in a wide variety of environments.     [ edit ]   Hoof changes in the long term   Equid hooves are the result of the 50-million-year  evolution of the horse . Wild and domesticated equus species share a very similar hoof shape and function. The present-day conformation of the hoof is a result of a progressive evolutionary loss of digits I, II, IV and V of the basal pentadactyl limb, with changes in bones, joints and hoof capsule. The resulting conformation allows a heavy, strong body to move with high speed on any ground, most efficiently on open, hard, flat areas like prairies and deserts (i.e. 'cursorial specialisation').

Heated seats, air dry, etc.                     Bath Lift                    Bidet Toilet      A bidet is a toilet-like invention that is mainly used to wash and clean the genitals and the other areas near these. Bidet is a device usually situated next to a toilet. It is sometimes mistaken to be a toilet or a urinal or even a drinking fountain by those unfamiliar to it. But one should be aware that a bidet is to be used only, right after using the toilet. Its purpose is to wash and clean and nothing more. Also, bidet is not solely for cleaning the genitals alone. It can also be used for other hygienic purposes.    Having a bidet is a great help for those who have physical disabilities, mobility problems and other related problems. A bidet produces an arc of water through a faucet-like device attached to it that leaves the user relaxed and cleaned and free from any excessive movement. According to health experts, a bidet is more effective in cleaning than toilet paper. And that it also helps prevent urinary tract infections and other ailments caused by poor hygiene.    There are different designs of bidets that are becoming more popular in the contemporary times. A bidet can be attached to the toilet itself or it can be a separate one. When a bidet is a part of a toilet, it can only be used as an instrument for cleaning the genitals. This type sometimes has two nozzles: the family nozzle and the bidet nozzle. The family nozzle is basically used to clean the area o the anus, while the bidet nozzle is used to clean the females vulva. There is also the existence of a more advanced kind of bidet known as bidet attachments. These are often used in hospitals for they have been proved to be highly commendable when it comes to maintaining personal hygiene.

A  tickler file  is a collection of date-labeled file folders organized in a way that allows time-sensitive documents to be filed according to the future date on which each document needs action. Documents within the folders of a tickler file can be to-do lists, pending bills, unpaid invoices, travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets, call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the tickler file so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a tickler file provides a way to send a reminder to oneself in the future"" tickling "" one's  memory .   Tickler  files  are often used in newsrooms by  editing ,  journalists , and  reporters , as well as by many other groups, including  sales representatives  and  professional offices  in  medicine ,  law ,  non-profit ,  government , and  accounting .   A tickler file system also has other applications such as museum guides, specialized fact books, time management software, or any organized arrangement of information to which a person may want quick access.           Contents       1   History   2   43 divisions   3   See also   4   External links               [ edit ]   History   One common implementation was in law offices in the early twentieth century, if not before, where small task cards or ""tickler cards"" would be filed by date and then distributed to lawyers as legal tasks such as renewal of trademarks, updating of wills and filing of motions for a particular case would be approaching. In larger firms a single person would be assigned the maintenance and follow-up of this file, distributing tasks and ensuring their follow-up, which could be recorded on the cards for billing and documentation.   More recently the concept was re-introduced to popular culture through various  self-help  books as Pam Young and Peggy Jones' 1977 book  Sidetracked Home Executives: From Pig-Pen to Paradise ,  FlyLady  Maria Ciley, Chris Crouch's book  Getting Organized ,  David Allen 's 2002 book  Getting Things Done  and  Merlin Mann's  website ""43 Folders,"" whose name comes from one popular method for maintaining a tickler file.     [ edit ]   43 divisions   In larger, institutional uses a tickler file would be chronological, with one section for each year or day, sometimes encompassing more than a century in as much detail as appropriate (especially for dates far in the future). A more common technique is to have index cards with forty-three dividers or a system with forty-three folders or two accordion files. The forty-three divisions  (31+12 = 43)  come from a maximum thirty-one days in a  Gregorian  or  Julian   month  and twelve months in a year. When something is scheduled for the coming month, it is placed within the appropriate daily section. Items which need to be done in a particular month are placed in one of the corresponding monthly folder, to be distributed in days near the beginning of that month. Tasks which are not completed may be moved to a different folder or kept in position to be revisited in the following month or year.   Simple systems which involve many repetitive tasks over time tend to use and re-use index cards of an appropriate size, with more complex systems using expandible ""accordion files,"" file folders or even entire rooms full of filing cabinets. Modern systems are usually maintained in computerized  databases  or with simple tools such as a Unix "".calendar"" file.

Look up  spa ,  Spa ,  SpA  in  Wiktionary , the free dictionary.     This article is about the therapeutic spa.  For other uses, see  Spa (disambiguation) .   The term  spa  is associated with water treatment which is also known as  balneotherapy ,  spa towns  or  spa resorts  offering such treatment, or the medication or equipment for such treatment. The term thus has various related meanings.           Contents       1   Origins of the term   2   History     2.1   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   2.2   Bathing in Medieval times   2.3   Bathing in the 18th century   2.4   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   2.5   Spas in colonial America   2.6   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America       3   Spa meaning a resort or place of treatment   4   Spa medication or equipment   5   International Spa Association definitions     5.1   Types of spa       6   Notes   7   External links               [ edit ]   Origins of the term   See also:  Mineral spa   The term is derived from the name of the town of  Spa, Belgium , whose name is known back to Roman times, when the location was called Aquae Spadanae,  [ 1 ]  perhaps related to the  Latin  word ""spagere"" meaning to scatter, sprinkle or moisten. [ 2 ]   Since  medieval  times illnesses caused by iron deficiency were treated by drinking  chalybeate  (iron bearing) spring water (in 1326, the ironmaster Collin le Loup claimed a cure,  [ 3 ]  when the spring was called  Espa , a  Walloon  word for ""fountain"" [ 3 ] ).   In 16th century  England  the old  Roman  ideas of medicinal bathing were revived at towns like  Bath , and in 1571  William Slingsby  who had been to the Belgian town (which he called  Spaw ) discovered a chalybeate spring in  Yorkshire . He built an enclosed well at what became known as  Harrogate , the first resort in England for drinking medicinal waters, then in 1596 Dr  Timothy Bright  called the resort  The English Spaw , beginning the use of the word  Spa  as a generic description rather than as the place name of the Belgian town. At first this term referred specifically to resorts for water drinking rather than bathing, but this distinction was gradually lost and many  spas  offer external remedies. [ 4 ]   It is commonly claimed, in a commercial context, that the word is an  acronym  of various Latin phrases such as ""Salus Per Aquam or ""Sanitas Per Aquam"" meaning ""health through water"". [ 5 ]  This is very unlikely: the derivation doesn't appear before the early 21st century and is probably a "" backronym "" as there is no evidence of acronyms passing into the language before the twentieth century; [ 6 ]  nor does it match the known Roman name for the location.     [ edit ]   History   The practice of traveling to hot or cold springs in hopes of effecting a cure of some ailment dates to prehistoric times. Archaeological investigations near hot springs in France and Czech Republic revealed  Bronze Age  weapons and offerings. In Great Britain, ancient legend credited early Celtic kings with the discovery of the hot springs at  Bath, England . [ 7 ]   Many people around the world believed that bathing in a particular spring, well, or river resulted in physical and spiritual purification. Forms of ritual purification existed among the native Americans, Persians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. Today, ritual purification through water can be found in the religious ceremonies of  Jews ,  Muslims ,  Christians ,  Buddhists , and  Hindus . These ceremonies reflect the ancient belief in the healing and purifying properties of water. Complex bathing rituals were also practiced in ancient Egypt, in prehistoric cities of the  Indus Valley , and in  Aegean  civilizations. Most often these ancient people did little building construction around the water, and what they did construct was very temporary in nature. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Greek and Roman times   Some of the earliest descriptions of western bathing practices came from Greece. The Greeks began bathing regimens that formed the foundation for modern spa procedures. These Aegean people utilized small bathtubs, washbasins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. They established public baths and showers within their  gymnasium  complexes for relaxation and personal hygiene.  Greek mythology  specified that certain natural springs or  tidal pools  were blessed by the gods to cure disease. Around these sacred pools, Greeks established bathing facilities for those desiring healing. Supplicants left offerings to the gods fo healing at these sites and bathed themselves in hopes of a cure. The  Spartans  developed a primitive vapor bath. At  Serangeum , an early Greek  balneum  (bathhouse, loosely translated), bathing chambers were cut into the hillside from which the hot springs issued. A series of niches cut into the rock above the chambers held bathers' clothing. One of the bathing chambers had a decorative mosaic floor depicting a driver and chariot pulled by four horses, a woman followed by two dogs, and a dolphin below. Thus, the early Greeks used the natural features, but expanded them and added their own amenities, such as decorations and shelves. During later Greek civilization, bathhouses were often built in conjunction with athletic fields. [ 7 ]   Main article:  Ancient Roman bathing   The Romans emulated many of the Greek bathing practices. Romans surpassed the Greeks in the size and complexity of their baths. As in Greece, the Roman bath became a focal center for social and recreational activity. As the  Roman Empire  expanded, the idea of the public bath spread to all parts of the Mediterranean and into regions of Europe and North Africa. With the construction of the  aqueducts , the Romans had enough water not only for domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses, but also for their leisurely pursuits. The aqueducts provided water that was later heated for use in the baths. Today, the extent of the Roman bath is revealed at ruins and in archaeological excavations in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. [ 7 ]   The Romans also developed baths in their colonies, taking advantage of the natural hot springs occurring in Europe to construct baths at  Aix  and  Vichy  in France,  Bath  and  Buxton  in England,  Aachen  and  Wiesbaden  in Germany,  Baden, Austria , and  Aquincum  in Hungary, among other locations. These baths became centers for recreational and social activities in Roman communities. Libraries, lecture halls, gymnasiums, and formal gardens became part of some bath complexes. In addition, the Romans used the hot thermal waters to relieve their suffering from  rheumatism ,  arthritis , and overindulgence in food and drink. The decline of the Roman Empire in the west, beginning in A.D. 337 after the death of  Emperor Constantine , resulted in Roman legions abandoning their outlying provinces and leaving the baths to be taken over by the local population or destroyed. [ 7 ]   Thus, the Romans elevated bathing to a fine art, and their bathhouses physically reflected these advancements. The Roman bath, for instance, included a far more complex ritual than a simple immersion or sweating procedure. The various parts of the bathing ritual  undressing, bathing, sweating, receiving a massage, and resting  required separated rooms which the Romans built to accommodate those functions. The segregation of the sexes and the additions of diversions not directly related to bathing also had direct impacts on the shape and form of bathhouses. The elaborate Roman bathing ritual and its resultant architecture served as precedents for later European and American bathing facilities. Formal garden spaces and opulent architectural arrangement equal to those of the Romans reappeared in Europe by the end of the eighteenth century. Major American spas followed suit a century later. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in Medieval times   With the decline of the Roman Empire, the public baths often became places of licentious behavior, and such use was responsible for the spread rather than the cure of diseases. A general belief developed among the European populace was that frequent bathing promoted disease and sickness. Medieval church authorities encouraged this belief and made every effort to close down public baths. Ecclesiastical officials believed that public bathing created an environment open to immorality and disease.  Roman Catholic Church  officials even banned public bathing in an unsuccessful effort to halt  syphilis  epidemics from sweeping Europe. Overall, this period represented a time of decline for public bathing. [ 7 ]   People continued to seek out a few select hot and cold springs, believed to be holy wells, to cure various ailments. In an age of religious fervor, the benefits of the water were attributed to God or one of the saints. In 1326 Collin le Loup, an ironmaster from  Lige, Belgium , discovered the  chalybeate  springs of  Spa, Belgium . Around these springs, a famous health resort eventually grew and the term ""spa"" came to refer to any health resort located near natural springs. During this period, individual springs became associated with the specific ailment that they could allegedly benefit. [ 7 ]   Bathing procedures during this period varied greatly. By the 16th century, physicians at  Karlsbad, Bohemia , prescribed that the mineral water be taken internally as well as externally. Patients periodically bathed in warm water for up to 10 or 11 hours while drinking glasses of mineral water. The first bath session occurred in the morning, and the second commenced in the afternoon. This treatment lasted several days until skin pustules formed and broke resulting in the draining of ""poisons"" considered to be the source of the disease. Then followed another series of shorter, hotter baths to wash the infection away and close the eruptions. [ 7 ]   In the English coastal town of  Scarborough  in 1626, a Mrs Elizabeth Farrow discovered a stream of acidic water running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town. This was deemed to have health-giving properties and gave birth to  Scarborough Spa . Dr Wittie's book about the spa waters published in 1660 attracted a flood of visitors to the town. Sea bathing was added to the cure, and Scarborough became Britain's first seaside resort. The first rolling bathing machines for bathers are recorded on the sands in 1735. [ 8 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 18th century   In the 17th century most upper-class Europeans washed their clothes with water often and washed only their faces (with linen), feeling that bathing the entire body was a lower-class activity; but the upper-class slowly began changing their attitudes toward bathing as a way to restore health later in that century. The wealthy flocked to health resorts to drink and bathe in the waters. In 1702  Queen Anne of England  traveled to Bath, the former Roman development, to bathe. A short time later,  Richard (Beau) Nash  came to Bath. By the force of his personality, Nash became the arbiter of good taste and manners in England. He along with financier  Ralph Allen  and architect  John Wood  transformed Bath from a country spa into the social capital of England. Bath set the tone for other spas in Europe to follow. Ostensibly, the wealthy and famous arrived there on a seasonal basis to bathe in and drink the water; however, they also came to display their opulence. Social activities at Bath included dances, concerts, playing cards, lectures, and promenading down the street. [ 7 ]   A typical day at Bath might be an early morning communal bath followed by a private breakfast party. Afterwards, one either drank water at the Pump Room (a building constructed over the thermal water source) or attended a fashion show. Physicians encouraged health resort patrons to bathe in and drink the waters with equal vigor. The next several hours of the day could be spent in shopping, visiting the lending library, attending concerts, or stopping at one of the coffeehouses. At 4:00 P.M., the rich and famous dressed up in their finery and promenaded down the streets. Next came dinner, more promenading, and an evening of dancing or gambling. [ 7 ]   Similar activities occurred in health resorts throughout Europe. The spas became stages on which Europeans paraded with great pageantry. These resorts became infamous as places of gossip and scandals. The various social and economic classes selected specific seasons during the year's course, staying from one to several months, to vacation at each resort. One season aristocrats occupied the resorts; at other times, prosperous farmers or retired military men took the baths. The wealthy and the criminals that preyed on them moved from one spa to the next as the fashionable season for that resort changed. [ 7 ]   During the 18th century a revival in the medical uses of spring water took place among some Italian, German, and English physicians. This revival changed the way of taking a spa treatment. For example, in Karlsbad the accepted method of drinking the mineral water required sending large barrels to individual boardinghouses where the patients drank physician-prescribed dosages in the solitude of their rooms. Dr. David Beecher in 1777 recommended that the patients come to the fountainhead for the water and that each patient should first do some prescribed exercises. This innovation increased the medicinal benefits obtained and gradually physical activity became part of the European bathing regimen. In 1797 in England Dr. James Currier published  The Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fever and other Diseases . This book stimulated additional interest in water cures and advocated the external and internal use of water as part of the curing process. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in the 19th and 20th centuries   In the 19th century, bathing became a more accepted practice as physicians realized some of the benefits that cleanliness could provide. A  cholera  epidemic in  Liverpool, England  in 1842 resulted in a sanitation renaissance  more people bathed and washed their clothes. That same year a house in  Cincinnati, Ohio , received the first indoor bathtub in the United States. Bathing, however, was still not a universal custom. Only one year later  in 1843  bathing between  November 1  and  March 15  was outlawed in  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , as a health measure, and in 1845 bathing was banned in  Boston, Massachusetts , unless under the direct orders of a physician. The situation improved, however, and by 1867 in Philadelphia most houses of the well-to-do had tubs and indoor plumbing. In England, hot showers were installed in barracks and schools by the 1880s. The taboos against bathing disappeared with advancements in medical science; the worldwide medical community was even promoting the benefits of bathing. In addition, the  Victorian  taste for the exotic lent itself perfectly to seeking out the curative powers of thermal water. [ 7 ]   In most instances the formal architectural development of European spas took place in the 18th and 19th centuries. The architecture of Bath, England, developed along  Georgian  and  Neoclassical  lines, generally following  Palladian  structures. The most important architectural form that emerged was the ""crescent""  a semi-elliptical street plan used in many areas of England. The architecture of Karlsbad,  Marienbad ,  Franzenbad , and  Baden-Baden  was primarily Neoclassical, but the literature seems to indicate that large bathhouses were not constructed until well into the 19th century. The emphasis on drinking the waters rather than bathing in them led to the development of separate structures known as  Trinkhallen  (drinking halls) where those taking the cure spent hours drinking water from the springs. [ 7 ]   By the mid-19th century the situation had changed dramatically. Visitors to the European spas began to stress bathing in addition to drinking the waters. Besides fountains, pavilions, and Trinkhallen, bathhouses on the scale of the Roman baths were revived. Photographs of a 19th-century spa complex taken in the 1930s, detailing the earlier architecture, show a heavy use of mosaic floors, marble walls, classical statuary, arched openings, domed ceilings, segmental arches, triangular pediments,  Corinthian  columns, and all the other trappings of a Neoclassical revival. The buildings were usually separated by function  with the Trinkhalle, the bathhouse, the inhalatorium (for inhaling the vapors), and the  Kurhaus  or  Conversationhaus  that was the center of social activity. Baden-Baden featured golf courses and tennis courts, ""superb roads to motor over, and drives along quaint lanes where wild deer are as common as cows to us, and almost as unafraid."" [ 7 ]   The European spa, then, started with structures to house the drinking function  from simple fountains to pavilions to elaborate Trinkhallen. The enormous bathhouses came later in the 19th century as a renewed preference for an elaborate bathing ritual to cure ills and improve health came into vogue. European architects looked back to Roman civilizations and carefully studied its fine architectural precedents. The Europeans copied the same formality, symmetry, division of rooms by function, and opulent interior design in their bathhouses. They emulated the fountains and formal garden spaces in their resorts, and they also added new diversions. The tour books always mentioned the roomy, woodsy offerings in the vicinity and the faster-paced evening diversions. [ 7 ]   By the beginning of the 19th century the European bathing regimen consisted of numerous accumulated traditions. The bathing routine included soaking in hot water, drinking the water, steaming in a vapor room, and relaxing in a cooling room. In addition doctors ordered that patients be douched with hot or cold water and given a select diet to promote a cure. Authors began writing guidebooks to the health resorts of Europe explaining the medical benefits and social amenities of each. Rich Europeans and Americans traveled to these resorts to take in cultural activities and the baths. [ 7 ]   Each European spa began offering similar cures while maintaining a certain amount of individuality. The 19th century bathing regimen at Karlsbad can serve as a general portrayal of European bathing practices during this century. Visitors arose at 6:00 AM to drink the water and be serenaded by a band. Next came a light breakfast, bath, and lunch. The doctors at Karlsbad usually limited patients to certain foods for each meal. In the afternoon visitors went sight-seeing or attended concerts. Nightly theatrical performances followed the evening meal. This ended around 9:00 PM with the patients returning to their boardinghouses to sleep until six the next morning. This regimen continued for as long as a month and then the patients returned home until the next year. Other 19th century European spa regimens followed similar schedules. [ 7 ]   At the beginning of the 20th century, European spas combined a strict diet and exercise regimen with a complex bathing procedure to achieve benefits for the patients. One example will suffice to illustrate the change in bathing procedures. Patients at Baden-Baden, which specialized in treating  rheumatoid arthritis , were directed to see a doctor before taking the baths. Once this occurred the bathers proceeded to the main bathhouse where they paid for their baths and stored their valuables before being assigned a booth for undressing. The bathhouse supplied bathers with towels, sheets, and slippers. [ 7 ]   The Baden-Baden bathing procedure began with a warm shower. The bathers next entered a room of circulating, 140-degree hot air for 20 minutes, spent another 10 minutes in a room with 150-degree temperature, partook of a 154-degree vapor bath, then showered and received a soap massage. After the massage, the bathers swam in a pool heated approximately to body temperature. After the swim, the bathers rested for 15 to 20 minutes in the warm ""Sprudel"" room pool. This shallow pool's bottom contained an 8-inch (200 mm) layer of sand through with naturally carbonated water bubbled up. This was followed by a series of gradually cooler showers and pools. After that, the attendants rubbed down the bathers with warm towels and then wrapped them in sheets and covered them with blankets to rest for 20 minutes. This ended the bathing portion of the treatment. The rest of the cure consisted of a prescribed diet, exercise, and water-drinking program. [ 7 ]   The European spas provided various other diversions for guests after the bath, including gambling, horse racing, fishing, hunting, tennis, skating, dancing, golf, and horseback riding. Sight-seeing and theatrical performances served as further incentives for people to go to the spa. Some European governments even recognized the medical benefits of spa therapy and paid a portion of the patient's expenses. A number of these spas catered to those suffering from obesity and overindulgence in addition to various other medical complaints. In recent years, elegance and style of earlier centuries may have diminished, but people still come to the natural hot springs for relaxation and health. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Spas in colonial America   Some European colonists brought with them knowledge of the hot water therapy for medicinal purposes, and others learned the benefits of hot springs from the Native Americans. Europeans gradually obtained many of the hot and cold springs from the various Indian tribes. They then developed the spring to suit European tastes. By the 1760s British colonists were traveling to hot and cold springs in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, and Virginia in search of water cures. Among the more frequently visited of these springs were  Bath ,  Yellow , and  Bristol Springs  in Pennsylvania;  Saratoga Springs ,  Kinderhook , and  Ballston Springs  in New York; and  Warm Springs ,  Hot Springs , and  White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia  (now in West Virginia) in Virginia. [ 7 ]   Colonial doctors gradually began to recommend hot springs for ailments. Dr.  Benjamin Rush , American patriot and physician, praised the springs of Bristol, Pennsylvania, in 1773. Dr.  Samuel Tenney  in 1783 and Dr. Valentine Seaman in 1792 examined the water of Saratoga Springs in New York and wrote of possible medicinal uses of the springs. Hotels were constructed to accommodate visitors to the various springs. Entrepreneurs opened taverns where the travelers could lodge, eat, and drink. Thus began the health resort industry in the United States. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Bathing in 19th and 20th century America   After the  American Revolution , the spa industry continued to gain popularity. By the mid 1850s hot and cold spring resorts existed in 20 states. Many of these resorts contained similar architectural features. Most health resorts had a large, two-story central building near or at the springs, with smaller structures surrounding it. The main building provided the guests with facilities for dining, and possibly, dancing on the first floor, and the second story consisted of sleeping rooms. The outlying structures were individual guest cabins, and other auxiliary buildings formed a semicircle or U-shape around the large building. [ 7 ]   These resorts offered swimming, fishing, hunting, and horseback riding as well as facilities for bathing. The Virginia resorts, particularly White Sulphur Springs, proved popular before and after the Civil War. After the Civil War, spa vacations became very popular as returning soldiers bathed to heal wounds and the American economy allowed more leisure time. Saratoga Springs in New York became one of the main centers for this type of activity. Bathing in and drinking the warm, carbonated spring water only served as a prelude to the more interesting social activities of gambling, promenading, horse racing, and dancing. [ 7 ]   Saratoga Springs in New York had extensive architectural development by the 1830s  a time when the buildings of  Hot Springs, Arkansas , were small log and frame structures without particularly distinctive detailing  just basic envelopes to keep occupants from the weather. By 1815 Saratoga had large, four-story,  Greek revival  hotels. The availability of train and steamship service to that destination by 1832 meant larger numbers of more sophisticated clients. With the exception of specialized baths provided in boardinghouses or small bathhouses connected with the hotels, Saratoga's development during the 19th century was based on leisure pursuits other than baths. Although Saratoga and other spas in New York centered their developments around the healthful mineral waters, their real drawing card was the complex social life  that included pursuits from gambling on racehorses to seeing the latest Paris fashions. Going to the mountains for the summer was a major exodus undertaken by urban dwellers who could afford it, and Saratoga became a hub of summer activity. Private development there featured enormous hotels with great ballrooms, opera houses, stores, and clubhouses. In 1865 the Union Hotel had its own esplanade, with fountain and formal landscaping, and two small bathhouses. Yet, during the 19th century the bathhouses were auxiliary structures and not the central features of the resort. [ 7 ]   During the last half of the 19th century western entrepreneurs developed natural hot and cold springs into resorts  from the  Mississippi River  to the West Coast. Many of these spas offered individual tub baths, vapor baths, douche sprays, needle showers, and pool bathing to their guests. The various railroads that spanned the country promoted these resorts to encourage train travel. Hot Springs, Arkansas, became a major resort for people from the large metropolitan areas of  St. Louis  and  Chicago . [ 7 ]   The popularity of the spas continued into the 20th century. Some medical critics, however, charged that the thermal waters in such renowed resorts as Hot Springs, Virginia, and Saratoga Springs, New York, were no more beneficial to health than ordinary heated water. The various spa owners countered these arguments by developing better hydrotherapy for their patients. At the Saratoga spa, treatments for heart and circulatory disorders, rheumatic conditions, nervous disorders, metabolic diseases, and skin diseases were developed. In 1910 the New York state government began purchasing the principal springs to protect them from exploitation. When  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  was governor of New York, he pushed for a European type of spa development at Saratoga. The architects for the new complex spent two years studying the technical aspects of bathing in Europe. Completed in 1933, the development had three bathhouses  Lincoln, Washington, and Roosevelt  a drinking hall, the Hall of Springs, and a building housing the  Simon Baruch Research Institute . Four additional buildings composed the recreation area and housed arcades and a swimming pool decorated with blue faience terra-cotta tile. Saratoga spa's Neoclassical buildings were laid out in a grand manner, with formal perpendicular axes, solid brick construction, and stone and concrete Roman-revival detailing. The spa was surrounded by a 1,200-acre (4.9 km 2 ) natural park that had 18 miles (29 km) of bridle paths, ""with measured walks at scientifically calculated gradients through its groves and vales, with spouting springs adding unexpected touches to its vistas, with the tumbling waters of Geyser Brook flowing beneath bridges of the fine roads. Full advantage has been taken of the natural beauty of the park, but no formal landscaping."" Promotional literature again advertised the attractions directly outside the spa: shopping, horse races, and historic sites associated with revolutionary war history. New York Governor  Herbert Lehman  opened the new facilities to the public in July 1935. [ 7 ]   Other leading spas in the country during this period were  French Lick, Indiana ; Hot Springs and White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; Hot Springs, Arkansas; and  Warm Springs, Georgia . French Lick specialized in treating obesity and constipation through a combination of bathing and drinking the water and exercising. Hot Springs, Virginia, specialized in digestive ailments and heart diseases, and White Sulphur Springs, Virginia, treated these ailments and skin diseases. Both resorts offered baths where the water would wash continuously over the patients as they lay in a shallow pool. Warm Springs, Georgia, gained a reputation for treating  infantile paralysis  by a procedure of baths and exercise. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who earlier supported Saratoga, became a frequent visitor and promoter of this spa. [ 7 ]   By the late 1930s more than 2,000 hot- or cold-springs health resorts were operating in the United States. This number had diminished greatly by the 1950s and continued to decline in the following two decades. Today's spas emphasize dietary, exercise, or recreational programs more than traditional bathing activities. The public bathing industry remains stagnant, but companies selling the individual home spas attract a large and growing market.

                         What is Tennis Elbow ?     Tennis elbow is an injury to the muscles and tendons on the outside (lateral aspect) of the elbow that results from overuse or repetitive stress. The narrowing of the muscle bellies of the forearm as they merge into the tendons create highly focused stress where they insert into the bone of the elbow.           Mechanism of Injury        Lateral epicondylitis        Injury to the lateral aspect of the elbow is the most common upper extremity tennis injury. Tennis elbow is generally caused by overuse of the extensor tendons of the forearm, particularly the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Commonly experienced by the amateur player, this injury is often a result of (1) a one-handed backhand with poor technique (the ball is hit with the front of the shoulder up and power generated from the forearm muscles), (2) a late forehand swing preparation with resulting wrist snap to bring the racquet head perpendicular to the ball, or (3) while serving, the ball is hit with full power and speed with wrist pronation (palm turned downward) and wrist snap which increases the stress on the already taught extensor tendons.      Medial epicondylitis       Medial epicondylitis is less common and  characteristically occurs with wrist flexor activity and pronation. Medial epicondylitis can result from (1) late forehand biomechanics where the player quickly snaps the wrist to bring the racquet head forward, (2) the back-scratch or cocking phase when serving, which places tremendous stress on the medial tissues of the elbow, (3) in the right elbow of a right-handed golf swing by throwing the club head down at the ball with the right arm rather than pulling the club through with the left arm and trunk (also referred to as ""golfers elbow""), or (4) improper pulling technique with certain swim strokes, especially the backstroke (also referred to as ""swimmers elbow"").     It should be kept in mind that elbow epicondylitis is not limited to those persons playing tennis, golf, baseball or swimming and can result from any activity that puts the lateral or medial compartments of the elbow under similar repetitive stress and strain (e.g., hammering, turning a key, screw driver use, computer work, excessive hand shaking).          Signs and Symptoms    General      difficulty holding onto, pinching, or gripping objects   pain, stiffness, or insufficient elbow and hand movement   forearm muscle tightness   insufficient forearm functional strength   point tenderness at or near the insertion sites of the muscles of the lateral or medial elbow       Specific          Lateral Epicondylitis     Medial Epicondylitis            painful resisted wrist extension         painful resisted wrist flexion            painful resisted radial deviation            (bending wrist toward pinky)        painful resisted forearm pronation               (palm facing downward)            palpation tenderness of the lateral epicondyle         palpation tenderness of the medial epicondyle               Rehabilitation -  What You Can Expect   Epicondylitis, both medial and lateral, is a common and often lingering pathologic condition. It is critical, therefore, that you progress your rehabilitation only when you experience minimal or no pain. For more on when and how to progress, see below.   As a general guideline, the more chronic or longer you have experienced the condition, the longer the recovery time is to be expected (up to 8 weeks).          Rehabilitation -  What should I do, when should I do it, and how?   Epicondylitis often becomes a chronic problem if not cared for properly. For this reason, it must be stressed that the rehabilitation process should not be progressed until you experience little or no pain at the level you are performing. Regaining full strength and flexibility is critical before returning to your previous level of sports activity.   In general, the rehabilitation process can be divided into three phases:      PHASE 1     Goals:  decrease inflammation and pain, promote tissue healing, and retard muscle atrophy. During the acute stage of your injury, whether the medial or lateral elbow is affected, follow the  RICE  principle:       R est - this means avoiding further overuse not absence of activity. You should maintain as high an activity level as possible while avoiding activities that aggravate the injury. Absolute rest should be avoided as it encourages muscle atrophy, deconditions tissue, and decreases blood supply to the area, all of which is detrimental to the healing process. Pain is the best guide to determine the appropriate type and level of activity.      I ce - is recommended as long as inflammation is present. This may mean throughout the entire rehabilitation process and return to sports. Ice decreases the inflammatory process slows local metabolism and helps relieve pain and muscle spasm.      C ompress and  E levate if appropriate to assist venous return and minimize swelling.          PHASE 2      Goals:  Improve flexibility, increase strength and endurance, increase functional activities and return to function.              Stretching        Gentle stretching exercises including wrist flexion, extension and rotation. The elbow should be extended and not flexed to increase the amount of stretch as required. These stretches should be held for 20-30 seconds and repeated 5-10 times, at least twice a day. Vigorous stretching should be avoided - do not stretch to the point of pain that reproduces your symptoms.        Strengthening        With the elbow bent and the wrist supported perform the following exercises:      Wrist Extension.  Place 1 lb. weight in hand with palm facing downward (pronated); support forearm at the edge of a table or on your knee so that only your hand can move. Raise wrist/hand up slowly (concentric contraction), and lower slowly (eccentric contraction).              Wrist Flexion.  Place 1 lb. weight in hand with palm facing upward (supinated); support forearm at the edge of a table or on your knee so that only your hand can move. Bend wrist up slowly (concentric), and then lower slowly (eccentric)(similar to exercise above).    Combined Flexion/Extension.  Attach one end of a string to a cut broom stick or similar device, attach the other end to a weight. In standing, extend your arms and elbows straight out in front of you. Roll the weight up from the ground by turning the wrists. Flexors are worked with the palms facing upward. Extensors are worked with the palms facing downward.    Forearm Pronation/Supination.  Grasp hammer (wrench, or some similar device) in hand with forearm supported. Rotate hand to palm down position, return to start position (hammer perpendicular to floor), rotate to palm up position, repeat. To increase or decrease resistance, by move hand farther away or closer towards the head of the hammer.               Finger Extension.  Place a rubber band around all five finger tips. Spread fingers 25 times, repeat 3 times. If resistance is not enough, add a second rubber band or use a rubber band of greater thickness which will provide more resistance.       Ball Squeeze.  Place rubber ball or tennis ball in palm of hand, squeeze 25 times, repeat 3 times. If pain is reproduced squeeze a folded sponge or piece of foam.           For all of the exercises (except combined flexion\extension) perform 10 repetitions 3-5 times a day. With the combined flexion/extension perform until you feel fatigue. With all exercises use pain as your guide - all exercises should be pain free.        When to progress.  Begin with a 1 lb. weight and perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions. When this becomes easy, work up to 15 repetitions. Increase the weight only when you can complete 15 repetitions 3 times without difficulty. The axiom ""No Pain No Gain"" does  NOT  apply here.    After exercising, massage across the area of tenderness with an ice cube for about 5 minutes. You might also try filling a paper cup half-full with water and freeze; peel back a portion of the paper cup to expose the ice.      PHASE 3     Goals:  Improve muscular strength and endurance, maintain and improve flexibility, and gradually return to prior level of sport or high level activity.       Continue the stretching and strengthening exercises emphasizing the eccentric contractions of wrist flexion and extension. In this regard, since the eccentric contractions are movements with gravity, do not let the weight drop too quickly; lower the weight in a controlled fashion. With the combined wrist flexion/extension exercise, work on increasing speed when rolling up the string with the attached weight as this will improve endurance.       When your symptoms are resolved and have regained full range of motion and strength, you may gradually increase your level of playing activity. An example of one gradual progressive return to tennis is as follows:               Lateral Epicondylitis       Medial Epicondylitis               15 minutes forehand only       15 minutes backhand and lobs                 30 minutes forehand only         30 minutes backhand and lobs                  30 minutes forehand and two handed backhand          30 minutes backhand, lobs, forehand (no top spin)                45 minutes forehand and backhand        45 minutes backhand, lobs, forehand                45 minutes all strokes        45 minutes all stokes                Serve        Serve                Full play        Full play                Competitive play        Competitive play                     The Scoop on  Bracing     Lateral counter-force bracing is believed to reduce the magnitude of muscle contraction which in turn reduces the degree of muscle tension in the region of muscular attachment. The counter-force brace is essentially an inelastic cuff that is worn around the proximal (near) forearm (against the forearm extensors for lateral epicondylitis and around the forearm flexors for medial epicondylitis).     In theory, the brace constrains full muscle expansion when the muscle contracts, diminishes muscle activity, and therefore the force generated by the muscle. An analogy is the fret on a guitar; when you exert pressure on a different fret along the neck of the guitar, it changes and reduces the tension on the guitar string above where the pressure is exerted.   The  counter-force brace can be worn beginning in Phase 2 of your rehabilitation program. However, adhere to the following caution:  do not become dependent on the counter-force brace and gradually wean yourself off its use during Phase 3. Counter-force bracing is a supplement to, not a replacement for your rehabilitation program.          Equipment Modifications   Using the wrong tennis racquet may have been a contributing factor to your injury. Guidelines for racquet selection for non-tournament players are provided below.     Racquet material  - Graphite composites are currently considered the best in terms of torsion and vibration control.    Head size  - A midsize racquet (95-110 square inches) is preferred. The popular oversized racquets cause problems because they make the arm susceptible to injury due to the increased torque effect of shots hit off-center.    String tension  - stay at the lower end of the manufacturer's recommendation. While higher string tensions provide improved ball control, it also increases the torque and vibration experienced by the arm.    Stringing material  - synthetic nylon (re-string every 6 months).    Grip size  - A grip too large or too small lessens control and promotes excessive wrist movement. To measure an appropriate grip size for your hand see image below.

Sit in the middle of the seat, with your feet shoulder width apart. You may place one foot  slightly  ahead of the other. Cross your arms at the wrists and hold them close to your chest. Stand completely up, then completely down. You can use your arms for assistance or for safety if you need. Count the number of chair stands you can complete in 30 seconds, your goal is to do at least 8 chair stands or more. If you perform less than 8, you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform activities that depend on leg strength.       Senior Fitness Test II - Arm Curl Test:    Assesses upper body strength and endurance   Use a 5 pound weight for women and an 8 pound weight for men. Chose a chair without armrests. Determine which arm is stronger and sit near that side of the chair. Hold the weight in your stronger hand using a suitcase grip with your arm in a down position beside the chair. Brace the upper arm against the body so that only the lower arm is moving. Curl your arm up through a full range of motion, gradually turning the palm up. As you lower your arm through the full range of motion, gradually return to the suitcase grip. Be sure to fully bend and then fully straighten the elbow. It's important that the upper arm is stable throughout the test, and doesn't swing. Count how many controlled arm curls you can perform in 30 seconds, your goal is 11 or more arm curls.  Less then 11 curls indicates that you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform activities that require arm strength.               Senior Fitness Test III - Chair Sit and Reach Test:    Assesses your lower body flexibility         You'll need a ruler and a partner to help you measure. Sit at the front edge of a straight back or folding chair placed against a wall for safety.  Keep one foot flat on the floor, extend the other leg forward knee straight, heel on the floor, ankle bent at 90°. Place one hand on top of the other with tips of the middle fingers even. Inhale, and as you exhale, reach toward your toe by bending at your hip. Keep your back straight and head up. Avoid bouncing or quick movements, and never stretch to the point of pain. Keep the knee straight, and hold the reach for 2 seconds. Your partner measures the distance between your fingertips and your toe to the nearest inch. If you reach your toe, score zero. If you don't reach your toe, score a negative distance, such as 3 inches; if you reach beyond your toe, score a positive distance, such as + 1 inch. Your goal is to reach at least 2 inches away from your toe for women and 4 inches for men.  If you are unable to meet this goal, you may need assistance with activities that require lower body flexibility. This test should not be done if you have severe Osteoporosis.           Senior Fitness Test IV - 8-Foot Up and Go:    Assesses speed, agility and balance while moving     You'll need a partner to time you. Use a stop watch for greatest accuracy. Place a straight back or folding chair next to a wall for safety and a cone or similar marker 8 feet from the chair. Make sure there's an unobstructed path from the chair around the marker. Begin fully seated. When your partner says, ""Go,"" stand and walk (don't run) as quickly as you can safely move around the cone, return to the chair, and sit down. If you normally use a cane or walker, it is OK to use it for the test. You are timed from the instant your partner says, ""Go,"" until you sit back down. For best results, practice the test once, and then perform it twice. Take your best score. Your goal is to perform the test in 9 seconds or less. If it takes you longer than this, you may require assistance to move from one place to another safely.         Senior Fitness Test V - Scratch Test:    Measures upper body flexibility     You'll need a ruler or a yardstick. Place your hand over your shoulder, and reach as far as possible down the middle of your back, your palm touching your body. Place your other arm behind your back, palm facing outward and reach up as far as possible attempting to touch or overlap the middle fingers of both hands. Practice two times, and then test two times. Your partner measures the distance between the tips of the middle fingers to the nearest half-inch. If the fingertips touch, score zero. If they do not touch, score a negative distance, such as 2 inches; if they overlap, score a positive distance, such as + 1 inch. Take your best score. For women the goal is to have your fingertips no more than 5 inches apart and for men no more that 8 inches apart. If you're unable to reach this goal, you may be at risk for losing the ability to perform some activities that require upper body flexibility. Stop the test if you experience pain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SIT AND BE FIT "" P.O.
