It is any furniture, fixtures, tools, or equipment that is used or   available for use in a business. It includes fixed assets, but does not include   supplies (such as pens and paper) or real estate. For a more detailed list of   applicable assets, see Sections One and Two of the BPP return form.

Yes, but your request must come in writing and be faxed or postmarked by   March 2.

What is the tax rate?                                                          The current tax rate is $3.60 per $100 of assessed value (that is, 3.6% of   the value). The rate is set each year by the board of   supervisors.                                                                                                                                                   What if I went out of business?                                                            You must notify our office  in writing  that you went out of business.   If your BPP is on commercial property and is still available for use in business  after  you went out of business, you are responsible to continue to   report it until it is removed or made unavailable for use in the   business . Note that BPP is NOT   pro-rated.                                                                                                                                                   What if I purchased or recapitalized an item on January   1?                                                           Report the item on the form and use a 90% assessment factor. Include a note   on the “Total” line that these assets are included there.                                                                                                                                                    What if I am a sole proprietor and I own the equipment   personally?                                                           You must still report any tangible equipment that is used or available for   use in your business.                                                                                                                                                    What if I own no equipment?                                                           Then you must write “None” on the return and still send it in, along with an   explanation of owning no equipment. You are required to file the return no   matter how much equipment you have. If you lease equipment, then report it in   Section Three of the return. You may be asked to provide a copy   of the lease agreement.                                                                                                                                                   Do you allow for technological obsolescence?                                                          Yes, for certain computer equipment and peripherals, as described in Section   Two of the return. Computers and peripherals are assessed using a more   progressive schedule of assessment factors, found in Section Two. Please note   that “computerized” equipment is not the same as a computer or peripheral and   would usually be reported along with all other equipment (in Section One),  not  with computer equipment in Section   Two.                                                                                                                                                   What if I do not depreciate anything?                                                           You must still file the form and report all equipment used or available for   use in the business. You must include an itemized list of all equipment; and you   may be asked to provide a copy of your federal Schedule C or Form 1120 in lieu   of the required copy of your federal depreciation   schedule.                                                                                                                       What do I need to attach to my form?                                                            An itemized list of all property reported, and a copy of your most   recent federal depreciation schedule (Form 4562), if you filed one. If you did   not file a federal depreciation schedule, you may be asked to provide other   supporting documents, including federal Schedule C or Form 1120 in lieu of the   Form 4562                                                       top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Machinery and Tools (M&T) Tax                                                                                  How do you determine who is a manufacturer or   processor?                                                                   This is a determination made by the commissioner, based on a   number of facts about the process and nature of your business activities.   Taxpayers must first submit the “BCI” Form , with relevant documentation such as   photos, process flow charts, or narratives for review. In some cases a site   visit is necessary by our auditors. The nature and extent of any transformation   during your process is most important in making this determination.                                                                                                                  Can I get an extension of time to file my   return?                                                                     Yes, but your request must come in writing and be faxed or   postmarked by March 2. An extension will be granted for no longer than 60 days.                                                                                                                                                  What if I went out of business?                                                                  You must notify our office in writing that you went out of business. If your   M&T is on commercial property and is still  availabl e for use in   business  after  you went out of business, you are responsible to   continue to report it until it is removed or made unavailable for use in the   business.  Note that M&T tax is NOT   pro-rated.                                                                                                                                                                           What about idle and unused equipment?                                                                   Machinery and tools may be reported as “Idle and   Unused” if they (a) have been discontinued in use continuously for at least one   year prior to January 1, 2009 or (b) on   and after January 1, 2008, have been   specifically identified in writing by the taxpayer to the commissioner of the   revenue on or before April 1, 2008, that   the machinery and tools would be withdrawn from service before January 1,   2009, not in use on January 1, 2009, and no reasonable prospect exists that the   machinery and tools will be returned to use prior to January 1, 2010.  Construction-in-progress, occasional, and   seasonal use of machinery and tools would not constitute “idle and unused”   property.                                   A detailed list of assets itemizing all property   reported by capitalized cost and date of acquisition must be submitted with this   return.  Also, an explanation must be provided with this return if there   is a difference between the property reported on this return and your 2008 return.  This asset list should   include a separate list of assets that were idle and unused continuously for one   year prior to January 1, 2009.                                   You may also submit a specific list of machinery and   tools that you anticipate will be removed from use not later than January 1,   2010, and expect the machinery and tools   will not be used at all during 2010.  This   list must be submitted on or before April 1, 2009, for the machinery and tools to be declared   idle and unused on the 2010 machinery and   tools form.                                   Once any property identified as “idle and unused” is   returned to use, please contact our office immediately for proper reporting   guidelines.                                                               top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Enterprise Zones                                                                                              I received the rebate last year. Do I need to apply   again this year?                                                                             Yes. Each year, you must file your M&T form, pay the tax bill,   and  then  submit a new request in writing for the   rebate.                                                                                                                                 For what period of time does the qualifying M&T   receive the rebate?                                                                            Rebates are issued for  five years  throughout the   twenty-year life of the Enterprise Zone.                                                                                                                                                                     Who qualifies for the rebate?                                                                          The qualification actually is determined by asset, individually. Each year,   therefore, the M&T taxpayer must submit an asset list detailing the   acquisition and cost figures of each asset, including also a declaration of any   disposals or replacements.                                                                                                                                                                                                   What if I replace a qualifying asset before its rebate period is   over?                                                                          The rebate on qualifying replacement assets is limited to an amount equal to   the increase in M&T tax assessed on the replacement equipment over the tax   assessed on the M&T that were replaced. It is the responsibility of the   taxpayer to identify replacement assets (as opposed to plant expansions or   simple new acquisitions and separate disposals, for which the regular rules   apply).                                                                     top                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Overview                         New Business Brochure -PDF                         Tangible Personal Property                                     Business License                                     Machinery & Tools                                     Enterprise Zone                                     Transient Occupancy                                     Short-Term Rental                                     Consumer Utilities                                     Consumption                                                                                                                                     Overview                         Personal Property Tax                                     Car Tax Relief                                     Assessments                                     Vehicle Updates                                     Filing Information                                     Personal Property FAQ's                                     Personal Property Forms                                     Income                                     Tax Relief                                     Consumer Utilities                                     Consumption                                     Real Estate Data                                                                                            Business FAQ's                              Property Tax FAQ's                                                                                                                                  Customer Service Standards                        Newsletter                      Spanish/Para Espal                        Contact Us                                                                                                              Can't find what you need?

This publication describes the environmental impacts of BOD,    how it is distributed in septic systems, and remediation strategies for    excess BOD.              Septic System    Additives  (HENV-13-W)    There are many products advertised as essentials for improving or    repairing septic systems. This publication examines types of additives    and the available scientific data regarding their effectiveness.              Seasonally    High Water Tables and Septic Systems    (HENV-12-W)    In late winter and spring, seasonally high water tables can reduce a    septic system's ability to treat wastewater. This publication explains    why these high water tables occur and examines septic system designs    used in areas where they occur.              Obtaining a    Septic System Permit  (HENV-11-W)    Before a new septic system can be installed or repairs can be made to    existing systems, Indiana rules require obtaining permits from a    homeowner's county health department. This publication describes how    homeowners can obtain these permits.              Septic Systems    in Flooded and Wet Soil Conditions  (HENV-10-W)    During flooding, saturated soils can prevent septic systems from    functioning properly and could lead to contaminated drinking water. This    publication offers homeowners specific suggestions they can follow    before, during, and after flooding to protect their water supply,    health, and septic system.      a class=""link"" href=""http://www.ces.purdue.edu/extmedia/HENV/HENV-9-W.pdf"">    Water Use and    Septic System Performance  (HENV-9-W)     This publication suggests plumbing and behavioral changes that can    reduce water consumption. Such changes can save homeowners money,    improve septic system performance, and reduce the risk for hydraulic    overload or other kinds of septic system failure.            b>  Gravel and Gravelless    Trench Soil Absorption Fields   (HENV 8-W)    In recent years, substitutes for traditional gravel trenches in septic    system soil absorption fields have become available. This publication    examines the strengths and weaknesses of these new technologies.              Indiana    Soils and Septic Systems  (HENV-7-W)    Soil is the most valuable component of an Indiana septic system. This    publication describes the soil characteristics that are necessary for    effective wastewater treatment.              Grandfathered Septic    Systems: Location and Replacement/Repair      (HENV-6-W)    This publication is aimed at owners of older homes or those thinking of    buying an older home. It provides suggestions on how to locate an    existing septic system and describes current Indiana rules regarding    septic system failures.              Septic    Tanks: The Primary Treatment Device of Your Septic System     (HENV-5-W)    Septic tanks play an essential role in treating wastewater in areas    without municipal sewage treatment, but tanks are just one part of the    septic system. This publication discusses the purpose and types of    septic tanks, and how to maintain them.              Septic System Distribution    Boxes: Importance of Equal Distribution in Trenches      (HENV-4-W)    Indiana septic systems frequently rely on distribution boxes to evenly    distribute wastewater effluent to soil absorption field trenches. This    publication explains how these distribution boxes work and how they can    be maintained to avoid costly repairs.              Turfgrass    Color: Indicator of Septic System Performance      (HENV-3-W)    Homeowners often notice color differences in the turfgrass over their    septic system soil absorption fields. This publication examines how    those color differences can be an early sign that troubles are about to    occur.                  Increasing the    Longevity of Your Septic System   (HENV-2-W)    Many new homeowners do not expect to pay several thousand dollars to    repair failing septic systems; however, many homeowners are faced with    this dilemma due to improper septic system maintenance. This publication    explains how a septic system functions and provides maintenance    instructions in order to increase a system lifespan.              Septic System Failure     (HENV-1- W)    This publication discusses various types of septic system failure, their    associated environmental impacts, and common causes of failure.               Local Septic  Management  Homeowner Checklist       Things to Keep In  Mind:     !    Inspect your system at least once every 3 years and pump your tank  at that time.     !    Use water efficiently     !    Don dispose of household hazardous wastes in sinks and toilets     !    Plant only grass over and near your septic system. Roots from  nearby trees or shrubs might clog and damage the drainfield.     !    Don drive or park vehicles on any part of your septic system.  Doing so can compact the soil in your drainfield or damage the pipes, tank, or    other septic system components.           System Design     There are two components of on-site system design: soil evaluation  and actual design. Soil evaluation consists of noting where your property lines  may be so that test holes can be dug. These holes will locate your soil  absorption system, which handles the fluid part of septic wastes. This step may  include actually digging the test holes with a backhoe, augering the soil or  performing a soil examination.     You can find a well-qualified consulting soil scientist who will do  soil and landscape evaluations for on-site wastewater disposal systems or for  other purposes. The registered soil scientists have the technical credentials  required by state law (Indiana Code 25-31.5) and have agreed to follow a Code of  Professional Conduct which states that they hold paramount the health and  welfare of the public and the protection of soil and water quality. To find a  soil scientist visit     http://www.isco.purdue.edu/irss/obtaining_services.html  or to  obtaining printed copies of the Roster - There is an additional cost to have  IRSS mail you a printed copy; contact the IRSS office at (765) 494-1492 for cost  information.      Questions to ask Prior to Choosing a Soil Evaluator         Will you provide a written estimate for all   phases of the proposed work?

As more people move into rural areas, the need for proper sewage disposal becomes increasingly important in order to protect the health of the public, of the environment and of our drinking water supplies.  The permit process assures that septic systems are designed, installed and operated according to current codes.  This helps meet community health needs, and provides the owner with a septic system that meets their needs.   The installation, repair, or replacement of any portion of a septic system (septic tank, drainfield and related components) requires a permit issued by the Environmental Health Division of the Clallam County Department of Community Development.   How to Obtain a Septic Permit    Contact a licensed Septic System   Designer  to begin the process.   Your designer will contact the Environmental Health Division to schedule soils/site evaluation with the Environmental Health Specialist.  (Note: This is a built-in step in the septic construction permit process.  It can also be done separately if you do not plan to build within the next three years.  Please see section on  Site Registrations .)   The designer will submit plans, construction permit application and  fees  to the Environmental Health Division.  With some types of systems, an  O&M Agreement  will also be required.  The Environmental Health Specialist will review the application and may visit the site again.  If corrections are needed, the application will be returned to the designer.   An approved permit is given to the designer, who will send it to you along with the approved plans.  A construction permit expires three years from the date it is issued.     Installing the Septic System After the septic permit is approved, the system should be installed by a certified  Septic System   Installer .   Exception:   Homeowners may install their own system if they are the owner and resident of the property, and install only one system per calendar year.  This still requires a design by a licensed designer and County approval and inspection.  Homeowners must follow design specifications.  If the system is installed incorrectly, it will not be approved and may need to be re-installed - which can cost thousands of dollars.   Both the Designer and the Environmental Health Division must be notified when installation begins.  The designer needs to inspect the system at various stages of construction and before final cover in order for the system to receive final approval.   Using the Septic System When the system has been installed, inspected, and approved, it is ready for use.  Remember that it needs continued  maintenance  and regular pumping in order to work properly.  The Environmental Health Division permits septic system  pumpers .  For some systems, an Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Agreement is needed.   Repairing a Septic System A repair may replace all or part of a failing septic system.  No reserve area is required for a repair permit, though it is still highly recommended.   The fee is less than  a new or expansion permit, and a repair permit expires six months after it is issued.   Community Septic Systems A community septic system serves more than one home, on one or more lots.  A community system may serve a duplex, or an entire subdivision (hundreds of homes).  For larger systems, the developer usually has the system designed, permitted, and the drainfield installed (but not the septic tanks).  A homeowner may need to get a septic tank placement permit, and have their tank installed and connected to the system when they build their home.   Commercial Septic Systems Commercial systems often have to accommodate either a very low flow, such as a small office, or a very high output, such as a shopping center.  Generally, commercial systems have stronger waste than residential septic systems.  This often requires special treatment of the sewage.  The design may be different, but the permit process is essentially the same as for residential systems.   What if I only want to know if my site/soils can support a Septic System? Property owners and prospective purchasers should understand a site's capabilities or limitations.  The Soil Conservation Service has soils maps of the county which describe the soil types and how well suited each one is for sewage disposal system.  These maps are not exact enough to rule out the need for a site specific evaluation.  This is accomplished through a  Site Registration .  This is a built-in step in the septic construction permit process, but it can also be done separately, even prior to purchasing, with the landowner's permission.   How large an area will I need for the drainfield? The size of the drainfield depends on the soil type and the number of bedrooms in your home.  The shape depends on soil depth and topography.  The drainfield area maybe as small as 10 x 40 feet or as large as 50 x 100 feet.  New systems also require a reserve area that is the same size as the initial drainfield.  This reserve area is in case the system fails and the drainfield needs to be replaced.   What if I live inside the City limits? The Environmental Health Division is responsible for permitting all septic systems in Clallam County.  There are some areas within the city limits of Port Angeles, Sequim and Forks that do not have sewer hook-ups and are served by on-site sewage systems.  If you have a septic system and the City sewer is extended to serve your area, you typically do not need to hook-up to the sewer unless your septic system fails.  Please  contact  Environmental Health or your City utility department for more information about your individual situation.

It is required that you  have a septic permit  before  you can get a building permit. To obtain a  septic permit you will need to have a site evaluation performed by an  Environmental Health specialist to determine the type of septic system you need  to install. The cost for this evaluation is $350.00. The paperwork for this process  is available at the Environmental Health office.     After the site evaluation is complete, you will submit a septic system design  application, along with the appropriate fee, to the Environmental Health office.  Homeowners planning to design and install their own septic system are allowed to  design and install only gravity flow systems. This process requires an  additional fee of $165. All other types of septic systems must be done by a  licensed installer.     A license is required for all septic system installers and designers wanting  to contract work in Kittitas County. These licenses are available through the  Environmental Health office.     A license is required of all septic tank pumpers contracting work in Kittitas  County. These licenses are available through the Environmental Health office.   Inspections   Licensed designer or installers,  request an inspection online .
