During the over 300 years of Brazilian colonial history, the economic exploitation of the territory was based first on  brazilwood  extraction (16th century),  sugar  production (16th-18th centuries), and finally on  gold  mining (18th century).  Slaves , specially those brought from  Africa , provided most of the working force.   In contrast to the neighbouring Spanish possessions, the Portuguese colony in  Latin America  kept its territorial and linguistic integrity after the independence, giving rise to the largest country in the region.

The Portuguese soon began extracting brazilwood from the rainforest for its valuable wood and for the red dye derived from it.     [ edit ]   The Age of Exploration   The European discovery of  Brazil  was preceded by a series of treaties between the kings of  Portugal  and  Castile , which were the leading seafaring powers at the time. The most decisive of these treaties was the  Treaty of Tordesillas , signed in 1494, that created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between those two kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian was to be property of  Portugal , west of it of  Spain .   The Tordesillas Meridian divided South America into two parts, leaving a large chunk of land to be exploited by the Spaniards. The Treaty of Tordesillas was arguably the most decisive event in all Brazilian history, since it alone determined that a portion of South America would be settled by Portugal instead of Spain. The present extent of Brazil's coastline is almost exactly that defined by the  treaty of Madrid , which was approved in 1750.          Portuguese map by Lopo Homem (c. 1519) showing the coast of Brazil and natives extracting brazilwood.         [ edit ]   Discovery and early settlement   On  April 22 ,  1500 , during the reign of  King Manuel I , a fleet led by navigator  Pedro lvares Cabral  landed in Brazil and took possession of the land in the name of the king. Although  it is debated  whether previous Portuguese explorers had already been in Brazil, this date is widely and politically accepted as the day of the discovery of Brazil by Europeans. Cabral was leading a large fleet of 13 ships and more than 1000 men following  Vasco da Gama 's way to  India , around  Africa . The place where Cabral arrived is now known as  Porto Seguro  (""safe harbor""), in Northeastern Brazil.          The brazilwood tree, which gives Brazil its name, has dark, valuable wood and provides red dye.       After the voyage of Cabral, the Portuguese concentrated their efforts on the lucrative possessions in Africa and India and showed little interest in Brazil. Between 1500 and 1530, relatively few Portuguese expeditions came to the new land to chart the coast and to obtain  brazilwood . In Europe, this wood was used to produce a valuable dye to stain luxury textiles. To extract brazilwood from the tropical  rainforest , the Portuguese and other Europeans relied on the work of the  natives , who worked in exchange for European goods like mirrors, scissors, knives and axes.   In this early stage of the colonisation of Brazil, and also later, the Portuguese frequently relied on the help of European adventurers who lived together with the aborigines and knew their languages and culture. The most famous of these were the Portuguese  Joo Ramalho , who lived among the Guaianaz tribe near today's  So Paulo , and Diogo lvares Correia, nicknamed  Caramuru , who lived among the Tupinamba natives near today's  Salvador de Bahia .   As time passed, the Portuguese realised that some European countries, especially  France , were also sending excursions to the land to extract  brazilwood . Worried about the foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession of the land and combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by  Martim Afonso de Sousa  arrived to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and to create the first colonial villages, like  So Vicente , at the coast.     [ edit ]   Colonisation   At first, Brazil was set up as fifteen private, hereditary captaincies. Pernambuco succeeded by growing sugar cane. So Vicente prospered by dealing in indigenous slaves. The other thirteen captaincies failed, leading the king to make colonization a royal effort rather than a private one. In 1549, Tom de Sousa sailed to Brazil to establish a central government. De Sousa brought along Jesuits, who set up missions, saved many natives from slavery, studied native languages, and converted many natives to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits' work to pacify a hostile tribe helped the Portuguese expel the French from a colony they had established at present-day Rio de Janeiro.     [ edit ]   Captaincies          Portuguese map (1574) by  Lus Teixeira , showing the location of the hereditary captaincies of Brazil.       The first attempt to colonise Brazil followed the system of hereditary captaincies ( Capitanias Hereditrias ), which had previously been used successfully in the colonisation of the  Madeira Island . The costs were transferred to private hands, saving the Portuguese crown from the high costs of colonisation. Thus, between 1534 and 1536  King John III  divided the land in 15  Captaincies of Brazil , which were given to Portuguese noblemen who wanted and had the means to administer and explore them. The captains were granted ample powers to administer and profit from their possessions.   From the 15 original captaincies, only two,  Pernambuco  and  So Vicente , prospered. The failure of most captaincies was related to the resistance of the Indigenous peoples, shipwrecks and internal disputes between the colonisers. Pernambuco, the most successful captaincy, belonged to Duarte Coelho, who founded the city of  Olinda  in 1536. His captaincy prospered with  sugarcane  mills used to produce  sugar  installed after 1542. Sugar was a very valuable good in Europe, and its production became the main Brazilian colonial produce in the next 150 years.   The captaincy of So Vicente, owned by Martim Afonso de Sousa, also produced sugar but its main economic activity was the traffic of indigenous slaves.     [ edit ]   General government   With the failure of most captaincies and the menacing presence of French ships in the Brazilian coast, the government of King John III decided to turn the colonisation of Brazil back into a royal enterprise. In 1549, a large fleet led by  Tom de Sousa  set sail to Brazil to establish a central government in the colony. Tom de Sousa, the first  Governor-General of Brazil , brought detailed instructions, prepared by the King's aides, about how to administer and foster the development of the colony. His first act was the foundation of the capital city,  Salvador da Bahia , in Northeastern Brazil, in today's state of  Bahia . The city was built on a slope by a bay (Todos-os-Santos Bay) and was divided into an upper administrative area and a lower commercial area with a harbour. Tom de Sousa also visited the captaincies to repair the villages and reorganise their economies. In 1551, the colony was turned into a  diocese  with its seat in Salvador.          Historical centre of  Salvador  today.       The second Governor General, Duarte da Costa (1553-1557), faced conflicts with the aborigines and severe disputes with other colonisers and the bishop. Wars against the natives around Salvador consumed much of his government. The fact that the first bishop of Brazil, Pero Fernandes Sardinha, was killed and eaten by the Caet natives after a shipwreck in 1556 illustrates how strained the situation was between the Portuguese and many indigenous tribes.   The third  Governor General of Brazil  was  Mem de S  (1557-1573), an efficient administrator that managed to defeat the aborigines and, with the help of the Jesuits, expel the French  Calvinists  that had established a colony in Rio de Janeiro (the  France Antarctique ). His nephew,  Estcio de S , founded the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565.   The huge size of Brazil led to the colony being divided into two  Estados  (states) after 1621, when  King Philip II  created the  Estado do Brasil , the most important colony with Salvador as capital, and the  Estado do Maranho , with capital in  So Lus . The state of Maranho was still further divided in 1737 into the  Estado do Maranho e Piau  and the  Estado do Gro-Par e Rio Negro , with its capital in  Belm do Par .   After 1640, the governors of Brazil coming from the high nobility started to use the title of  Vice-rei  ( Viceroy ). Brazil became officially a  Viceroyalty  around 1763, when the capital of the  Estado do Brazil  was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. In 1775 all Brazilian  Estados  (Brasil, Maranho and Gro-Par) were unified into the Viceroyalty of Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as capital.   As in Portugal, each colonial village and city had a  city council  ( cmara municipal ), whose members were prominent figures of colonial society (land owners, merchants, slave traders). Colonial city councils were responsible for regulating commerce, public infrastructure, professional artisans, prisons etc.          17th century-Jesuit church in  So Pedro da Aldeia , near Rio de Janeiro.         [ edit ]   Jesuit missions       Main article:  Jesuit Reductions       Tom de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of  Jesuits  to the colony. More than any other religious order, the Jesuits represented the spiritual side of the enterprise and were destined to play a central role in the colonial history of Brazil. The spreading of the Catholic faith was an important justification for the Portuguese conquests, and the Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tom de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianise the indigenous peoples.   The first Jesuits, guided by Father  Manuel da Nbrega  and including prominent figures like Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes and later  Jos de Anchieta , established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in  So Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga , the settlement that gave rise to the city of  So Paulo . Nbrega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of the  France Antarctique  by managing to  pacify  the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of  Rio de Janeiro  in 1565.   The success of the Jesuits in converting the indigenous peoples to  Catholicism  is linked to their capacity to understand the native culture, specially the language. The first  grammar  of the  Tupi  language was compiled by Jos de Anchieta and printed in  Coimbra  in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the aborigines in communities (the  Jesuit Reductions ) where the natives worked for the community and were evangelised.   The Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from  slavery , but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the aborigines had no natural defences. Slave labour and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did not object the enslavement of African peoples.     [ edit ]   French incursions   The potential riches of tropical Brazil led the French, who did not recognise the Tordesillas Treaty, to attempt to colonise parts of the Portuguese colony. In 1555, the  Huguenot   Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon  founded a settlement within  Guanabara Bay , in an island in front of today's Rio de Janeiro. The colony, named  France Antarctique , led to conflict with Governor General  Mem de S , who waged war against the colony in 1560.  Estcio de S , nephew of the Governor, founded Rio de Janeiro in 1565 and managed to expel the last French settlers in 1567. Jesuit priests Manuel da Nbrega and Jos de Anchieta were instrumental in the Portuguese victory by pacifying the natives who supported the French.   Another French colony, the  France quinoxiale , was founded in 1612 in present-day  So Lus , in the North of Brazil. In 1614 the French were again expelled from So Lus by the Portuguese.          View of a sugar-producing farm ( engenho ) in colonial  Pernambuco  by Dutch painter Frans Post (17th century).         [ edit ]   The Sugarcane Cycle (1530-1700)   Since the initial attempts to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe.  Tobacco ,  cotton ,  cachaa  and some other agricultural goods were produced, but  sugar  became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century. The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for the success of the captaincies of So Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. The period of sugar-based economy (1530-c.1700) is known as the ""Sugarcane Cycle"" in Brazilian history.   Sugarcane  was cultivated on large patches of land, harvested and processed in the  engenhos , which were the houses were sugarcane was milled and the sugar refined. Over time, the term  engenho  was applied to the whole sugarcane farm. The dependencies of the farm included a  casa-grande  (big house) where the owner of the farm lived with his family, and the  senzala , where the slaves where kept.   Initially, the Portuguese relied on aborigine  slaves  to work on sugarcane harvesting and processing, but they soon began  importing black African slaves . Portugal owned several commercial facilities in Western Africa, where slaves were bought from African merchants. These slaves were then sent by ship to Brazil, chained and in crowded conditions. The idea of using African slaves in colonial farms based on  monoculture  was also adopted by other European colonial powers when colonising tropical regions of America, like  Spain  in  Cuba ,  France  in  Haiti ,  the Netherlands  in the  Dutch Antilles  and  England  in  Jamaica .   The Portuguese severely restricted colonial trade, meaning that Brazil was only allowed to export and import goods from Portugal and other Portuguese colonies. Brazil exported sugar, tobacco, cotton and native products and imported from Portugal  wine ,  olive oil ,  textiles  and luxury goods - the latter imported by Portugal from other European countries. Africa played an essential role as the supplier of slaves, and Brazilian merchants frequently exchanged  cachaa , a distilled spirit derived from sugarcane, for slaves. This comprised what is now known as the  Triangular trade  between Europe, Africa and the Americas during the colonial period.   Even though the Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the  Antilles , located much closer to Europe, causing the sugar prices to fall.

[ edit ]   The Iberian Union and Dutch incursions   In 1580, a  succession crisis  led to  Portugal  forming a  personal union  with  Spain  under the  Habsburg  King  Philip II . The unification of the two Iberian kingdoms, known as the  Iberian Union , lasted until 1640.  The Netherlands  (the  Seventeen Provinces ) obtained independence from Spain in 1581, leading Philip II to prohibit commerce with Dutch ships, including in Brazil. Since the  Dutch  had invested large sums in financing sugar production in the Brazilian Northeast, a conflict began with Dutch  privateers  plundering the coast: they sacked  Salvador  in 1604, from which they removed gold and silver literally in barrels before a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured the town.   From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in commercial  Recife  and aristocratic  Olinda , and with the capture of  Paraiba  in 1635, the Dutch controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe ( Dutch Brazil ), without, however, penetrating the interior. But the large Dutch ships were unable to moor in the coastal inlets where lighter Portuguese shipping came and went, and the ironic result of the Dutch capture of the sugar coast was that the price of sugar rose in Amsterdam. During the  Nieuw Holland  episode, the colonists of the  Dutch West India Company  in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence in Recife of the Grand Duke  John Maurice of Nassau  as governor (1637-1641?). Nassau invited scientific commissions to come and research the local flora and fauna, resulting in additions to the time's knowledge. Moreover, he set up a city project for Recife and Olinda, which was partially accomplished. Some survive up to this day.   After several years of open warfare, the Dutch formally withdrew in 1661; the Portuguese paid off a war debt in payments of salt. Little Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remained of these failed attempts.     [ edit ]   The Quilombos   Work on the sugarcane plantations in Northeast Brazil and other areas relied heavily on  slave labour , mostly of black African origin. Since the early 17th century there are indications of runaway slaves organising themselves into settlements in the Brazilian hinterland. These settlements, called  mocambos  and  quilombos , gathered not only African slaves but also people of indigenous origin. The largest of the quilombos was the  Quilombo dos Palmares , located in today's  Alagoas  state, governed by semi-mythical leaders  Ganga Zumba  and his successor,  Zumbi . The Dutch and later the Portuguese attempted several times to conquer Palmares, until an army led by famed So Paulo-born  Domingos Jorge Velho  managed to destroy the great quilombo and kill Zumbi in 1695. Of the many quilombos that once existed in Brazil, some have survived to this day as isolated rural communities.     [ edit ]   Inland expansion: the  entradas  and  bandeiras   Since the 16th century the exploration of the Brazilian inland was attempted several times, mostly to try to find mineral riches like the  silver  mines found in 1546 by the Spanish in  Potos  (now in  Bolivia ). Since no riches were initially found, colonisation was restricted to the coast where the soil was suitable for  sugarcane   plantations .   The expeditions to inland Brazil are divided into two types: the  entradas  and the  bandeiras . The  entradas  were done in the name of the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main objective was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and charter unknown territory. The  bandeiras , on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the  So Paulo  region (the  paulistas ). The expeditions of the  bandeirantes , as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. The  paulistas , who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, knew all the old indigenous pathways (the  peabirus ) through the Brazilian inland and were used to the harsh conditions of these journeys.   At the end of the 17th century, the  bandeirantes  expeditions discovered gold in central Brazil, in the region of  Minas Gerais , which started a  gold rush  that led to a dramatic urban development of inland Brazil during the 18th century. Another consequence of the inland expeditions was the westward expansion of the frontiers of colonial Brazil, beyond the limits established by the  Treaty of Tordesillas  of 1494.

[ edit ]   The gold cycle (18th century)   At the end of the 17th century, the  bandeirantes  found  gold  in the interior of Brazil. The news was met with great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands. A  gold rush  quickly ensued, with people from other parts of the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the 18th century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the  Minas Gerais  (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the main economic activity of colonial Brazil during the 18th century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialised goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like  England  and, specially during the reign of  King John V , to build magnificent  Baroque  monuments like the  Convent of Mafra . Apart from gold,  diamonds  deposits were also found in 1729 around the village of Tijuco, now  Diamantina .   In the hilly landscape of Minas Gerais, gold was present in  alluvial deposits  by streams and was extracted using pans and other rudimentary instruments that required little technology. The hard work of gold extraction was mostly done by  slaves  imported from Africa. The Portuguese Crown allowed particulars to extract the gold, requiring a fifth (20%) of the gold (the  quinto ) to be sent to the colonial government as tribute. To prevent smuggling and charge the  quinto , in 1725 the government ordered all gold to be  casted  into bars in the  Casas de Fundio  (Casting Houses), and sent armies to the region to prevent disturbances and oversee the mining process. The Royal tribute was very unpopular in Minas Gerais, and gold was frequently hidden from the colonial authorities. Eventually, the  quinto  contributed to rebellious movements like the  Levante de Vila Rica , in 1720, and the  Inconfidncia Mineira , in 1789 (see below).   The large number of adventurers coming to the Minas Gerais led to the foundation of several villages, the first of which were created in 1711:  Vila Rica de Ouro Preto ,  Sabar  and  Mariana , followed by  So Joo Del Rei  (1713), Serro, Caet (1714), Pitangui (1715) and So Jos do Rio das Mortes (1717, now  Tiradentes ). In contrast to other regions of colonial Brazil, people coming to Minas Gerais settled mostly in villages instead of the countriside.   In 1763, the capital of colonial Brazil was transferred from  Salvador  to  Rio de Janeiro , which was located closer to the mining region and provided a harbour to ship the gold to Europe.   Gold production declined towards the end of the 18th century, beginning a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland.          18th century-So Jos Fortress near  Florianpolis , in Southern Brazil.         [ edit ]   Colonisation of the South   In an attempt to expand the borders of colonial Brazil and profit from commerce with the silver mines of  Potos , the Portuguese Overseas Council (the  Conselho Ultramarino ) ordered colonial governor Manuel Lobo to establish a settlement on the shore of the  River Plate , in a region that legally belonged to Spain. In 1679, Manuel Lobo founded  Colonia de Sacramento  on the margin opposite to  Buenos Aires , and the fortified settlement quickly became an important point of illegal commerce between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Spain and Portugal fought over the enclave in several occasions (1681, 1704, 1735).   In addition to Colonia de Sacramento, several settlements were established in Southern Brazil in the late 17th and 18th century, some with peasant couples from the  Azores Islands . The towns founded in this period include  Curitiba  (1668),  Florianpolis  (1675),  Rio Grande  (1736),  Porto Alegre  (1742) and others that kept Southern Brazil firmly under Portuguese control.   The conflicts over the Southern colonial frontiers led to the signing of the  Treaty of Madrid (1750) , in which Spain and Portugal agreed to a considerable Southwestward expansion of colonial Brazil. According to the treaty, Colonia de Sacramento was to be given to Spain in exchange for the territories of  So Miguel das Misses , a region occupied by  Jesuits Missions  dedicated to evangelising the  Guaran natives . Resistance by the Jesuits and the Guarani led to the  Guarani War  (1756), in which Portuguese and Spanish troops destroyed the Missions. Colonia de Sacramento kept changing hands until 1777, when it was definitely conquered by the colonial governor of Buenos Aires.          Quartered body of  Tiradentes , by Brazilian painter  Pedro Amrico  (1893).         [ edit ]   Inconfidncia Mineira   In 1788/89, Minas Gerais was the setting of the most important of the conspiracies against colonial authorities, the so called  Inconfidncia Mineira . The Inconfidncia was inspired by the ideals of the French  liberal  philosophers of the  Age of Enlightenment  and the successful  American Revolution , which had taken place in 1776. The conspirators belonged to the white upper class of Minas Gerais and many had studied in Europe, specially in the  University of Coimbra . Several of them, like a great part of the elite of Minas Gerais, had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of a declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the  derrama ) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a  Republic  in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be  So Joo Del Rei , and  Ouro Preto  would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact.   The conspiracy was discovered by the Portuguese colonial government in 1789, before the planned military rebellion could take place. Eleven of the conspirators were banned to Portuguese colonial possessions in  Angola , but Joaquim Jos da Silva Xavier, nicknamed  Tiradentes , was sentenced to death. Tiradentes was hanged in Rio de Janeiro in 1792, quartered and his body parts were sent to different towns as an example. He later became a symbol of the struggle for Brazilian independence and liberty from Portuguese rule.   The Inconfidncia Mineira was not the only rebellious movement in colonial Brazil against the Portuguese. Later, in 1798, there was the  Incofidncia Baiana  in the former capital, Salvador. In this episode, which had more participation of the common people, four people were hanged, and 41 were jailed. Members included slaves, middle-class people and even some landowners.     [ edit ]   United Kingdom period (1808-1822)   In 1807, as the Portuguese were allies of  England , the French troops of  Napoleon Bonaparte  invaded Portugal.  Prince Regent   Joo  (future King Joo IV), who governed since 1792 on behalf of his mother,  Queen Maria I , ordered the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil before he was deposed by the invading army.   In January 1808, Prince Joo and his court arrived in  Salvador , where he signed a commercial regulation that opened commerce between Brazil and  friendly nations , which in this case represented England. This important law broke the  colonial pact  that, until then, only allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations with Portugal.          The  Pao Imperial , 18th century-colonial palace located in Rio de Janeiro, used as dispach house by  King Joo VI  of Portugal and later by  Emperor Pedro I  of Brazil.       In March 1808, the court arrived in  Rio de Janeiro . In 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, Prince Joo created the  United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarve  ( Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves ), elevating Brazil to the rank of Portugal and increasing the administrative independence of Brazil. Brazilian representatives were elected to the Portuguese Constitutional Courts ( Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas ). In 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, Prince Joo was crowned King of Portugal in Rio de Janeiro.   Among the important measures taken by Prince Joo in his years in Brazil were incentives to commerce and industry, the permission to print newspapers and books, the creation of two medicine schools, military academies, and the first Bank of Brazil ( Banco do Brasil ). In Rio de Janeiro he also created a powder factory, a  Botanical Garden , an art academy ( Escola Nacional de Belas Artes ) and an opera house ( Teatro So Joo ). All these measures greatly advanced the independence of Brazil in relation to Portugal and made the later political separation between the two countries inevitable.   Due to the absence of the King and the economical independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a severe crisis that obliged Joo VI and the royal family to return to Portugal in 1821. The heir of Joo VI,  Prince Pedro , remained in Brazil. The Portuguese  Cortes  demanded Brazil to return to its former condition of colony and the return of the heir to Portugal. Prince Pedro, influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Senate ( Senado da Cmara ) refused to return to Portugal in the famous  Dia do Fico  (January 9, 1822). Political independence came in  September 7 ,  1822 , and the prince was crowned emperor in Rio de Janeiro as  Dom Pedro I , ending 322 years of colonial dominance of Portugal over Brazil.
