Counseling to Prevent Household and Recreational Injuries  RECOMMENDATION  Periodic counseling of the parents of children on measures to reduce the risk of unintentional household and recreational injuries is recom mended. Counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries is also recommended for adolescents and adults based on the proven effi cacy of risk reduction, although the effectiveness of counseling these pa tients to prevent injuries has not been adequately evaluated. Persons with alcohol or drug problems should be identified, counseled, and monitored (see Chapters 52 and 53). Those who use alcohol or illicit drugs should be warned against engaging in potentially dangerous activities while intoxi cated. Counseling elderly patients on specific measures to prevent falls is recommended based on fair evidence that these measures reduce the risk of falls, although the effectiveness of counseling elders to prevent falls has not been adequately evaluated. More intensive individualized multifactorial intervention is recommended for high-risk elderly patients in settings where adequate resources to deliver such services are available. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ex ternal hip protectors to prevent fall injuries. Counseling to prevent motor vehicle and pedestrian injuries is discussed in Chapter 57. Burden of Suffering Unintentional injuries accounted for nearly 89,000 deaths (34.4/100,000 population) in the U.S. in 1993, making them the fifth leading cause of death.1 Although the age-adjusted unintentional injury death rate has declined by 28% since 1979,2 such injuries remain the leading cause of death in all age groups from 1 to 34 years1 and the leading cause of years of potential life lost before age 65.3 In the U.S. in 1992, injuries accounted for 2.7 million hospitalizations (10.7/1,000 population),4 34 million emergency department visits,5 and 62 million visits to office-based physicians and hospital outpatient departments (nearly 10% of all such visits).6,7 The lifetime economic cost for injuries that occurred in the U.S. in 1985, updated to 1988, has been estimated at $182 billion.8 Almost half of all un659   660  Section II:Counseling  intentional injury-related deaths occur in motor vehicle crashes (see Chapter 57).1 The remainder, about 48,000 each year,1 are household, recreational, and other unintentional injuries. Falls, poisoning, fires and burns, drowning, suffocation and aspiration, firearms, and bicycling cause nearly two thirds of these deaths.9 Almost 90% of deaths relating to sports and recreation occur during swimming, boating, bicycling, riding off-road vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), or using firearms.9 Each year about 12,000 Americans, primarily older persons, die as a result of falls .9 Falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury death in the U.S. (after motor vehicle injuries) and the leading cause of nonfatal injuries.5,9,10 The death rate due to falls in the general population is 5.1/100,000 persons, increasing to 10.2/100,000 for those aged 6574 and to 147.0/100,000 for persons aged 85 and over.10 Population-based studies of community-dwelling elderly persons have estimated an annual total injurious fall rate of 229/1,000 persons,11 serious fall injury rate of 8496/1,000,12 and fall injury hospitalization rate of 13.5/1,000.13 Half of serious fall injury events in elderly persons result in discharge to a nursing home.12 Hip fractures are an especially grave complication of falls in older adults, resulting in more hospital admissions than any other injury, and accounting for 254,000 hospital admissions in 1988.9 There is a 1020% reduction in expected survival in the first year following a hip fracture,1417 and roughly half of survivors never recover normal function.15 Unintentional poisonings, the third leading cause of unintentional injury deaths, account for 5,300 deaths each year, the vast majority of these among adults.9 The mortality rate for poisonings among children 04 years of age was 0.2/100,000 in 1988, a >90% decline from 1960.9 Fires and burns are the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury death in the U.S. Each year, fires and burns are responsible for at least 5,000 deaths and 1.4 million injuries.9 Residential fires account for 73% of these deaths. The lifetime cost of fire and burn injuries occurring in 1985 was estimated to be $3.8 billion.8 Nearly 5,000 Americans die each year by drowning, in cluding 1,000 boating-related drownings.9 Death rates from drowning are highest in children <5 years old and in young men aged 1524 years.10,18,19 It has been estimated that for each childhood drowning fatality, about 4 children are hospitalized and 14 are seen in the emergency department and released. 19 From 1971 to 1988, drowning rates declined substantially among older children and adolescents, but declined only slightly in toddlers and actually increased in infants.18 Some 4,700 deaths attributable to mechanical suffocation (e.g., strangulation on clothing) and aspiration of food and other foreign materials occur annually, most of these in infants and in elderly persons.9 Firearm injuries resulted in 1,740 unintentional deaths (5% of all firearm fatalities) in 1993,1 and cause 12,000 to 30,000 nonfatal injuries each year.9,20,21 BB guns and other air-powered firearms   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  661  are estimated to injure an additional 19,50034,500 people each year.21 Bicycling injuries accounted for about 550,000 emergency room visits and 1,000 deaths annually between 1984 and 1988, mostly in children and adolescents.22 The injury rate has been estimated at 187/100,000 and the head injury rate at 5175/100,000, with peak rates occurring among children aged 514 years.22,23 Data regarding bicyclists involved in traffic crashes suggest declines in both injuries and fatalities in the last 5 years.24 Between 1982 and 1988 more than 1,100 fatalities and 400,000 emergency room-treated injuries related to ATVs were reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 25 Efficacy of Risk Reduction Certain injury-specific risk factors have been identified for household and recreational injuries. These are discussed below. In general, injury control strategies based on these risk factors are derived from evidence of association observed in retrospective studies rather than from prospective trials demonstrating efficacy. There have been only a few cohort studies or clinical trials measuring the impact on injury rates of eliminating risk factors for household and recreational injuries. Children. Fires and burns were the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related death among children aged 09 years in 1991.26 Most injuries and 7590% of deaths from fires occur in residential fires.27,28 The risk of fatality in the event of a house fire is significantly increased when children <5 years old are present in the household. 29 Smoke detectors are effective in preventing deaths in residential fires. Death in a residential fire is 23 times more likely in homes without smoke detectors than in those with such devices.2931 Smoke detectors often fail to operate, however, due to incorrect installation or inadequate testing.28,32 Correct installation and periodic testing are necessary to ensure proper operation. Measures to prevent residential fires from occurring are also important for reducing fire and burn injuries. Residential fires occur more frequently in the winter, associated with the use of portable heaters, fireplaces, and Christmas trees.26,29 Some attention has been given to the hazards of certain stoves and heaters,33 but the effectiveness of clinical intervention to reduce these hazards has not been evaluated. Cigarette smoking by household members is a leading cause of residential fires, many of which may be preventable (see Adolescents and Adults , below). A large proportion of residential fire deaths in children <5 years of age is caused by children playing with matches and lighters.26 The development of child-resistant cigarette lighters has been proposed as a preventive measure.34 For children, wear ing flame-retardant clothing is effective in reducing injury from clothing ignition due to, for example, residential fires, cigarettes, matches, or lighters.10,35,36   662  Section II:Counseling  Hot tap water burns, which account for 2,600 hospitalizations each year and 24% of all scald burn hospitalizations in children, are preventable by setting household water heaters at or below 120130F.10,3739 Anti-scald devices can be installed to cut off water flow when the water temperature exceeds 120F, although their efficacy in reducing burn rates has not been evaluated adequately. In one pilot study, 85% of such devices had been removed within 9 months of installation because of sediment build-up, and there were too few outcomes to assess any impact on scald burn rates.40 The causes of drowning, and thus preventive strategies, depend on the age of the patient. In small children, 4090% of drownings (depending on locale) occur in swimming pools, usually located in the victim's backyard.4147 In about two thirds of these cases, the children are supervised by one or both parents at the time of drowning and the adult caretakers are unaware that the toddler has wandered near the pool or entered the water.42,46,48 Observational studies suggest that 5080% of such drownings can be prevented by enclosing swimming pools with 4-foot, four-sided fences with self-latching, self-closing gates that isolate the pool from the house and yard (""isolation fences"") to protect children from wandering into the pool area.42,4852a Some have recommended infant and toddler swimming lessons as a means of improving survival after submersion. The effectiveness of lessons at this age has never been proved convincingly, however;53 their safety has been questioned on the basis of case reports of water intoxication and hyponatremia.54 Bathtub-related drowning is an important problem in children <5 years old.55 The majority of infant drownings occur in bathtubs.46,47 These drownings are often associated with a history of inadequate supervision.46,47,55 Interventions to improve bathing supervision have not been evaluated, however. Immediate initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in children with submersion injury has been associated with improved outcome,44,48,56,57 suggesting that CPR training for pool owners, parents, and children's caretakers may reduce the likelihood of drowning or neurologic injury after submersion. Among children under 15 years, 3540% of firearm deaths are unintentional.21 Over 90% of firearm incidents involving children occur at home; a study in children aged 014 years found that 40% involved a firearm stored in the room where the shooting occurred.58 Persons who keep guns for the purpose of protection are more likely to keep their guns loaded,59 but for each case of a firearm being successfully used for self-protection (i.e., shooting an intruder), firearms in the home are estimated to be 1.36 times more likely to cause an unintentional fatality and 10 times more likely to cause an unintentional injury, many of these in children.21,60 The U.S. General Accounting Office estimated that nearly one third of unintentional firearm deaths might be prevented by the use of   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  663  trigger locks and loading indicators.61 These and other potential clinical preventive strategies to prevent firearm injuries (e.g., removing guns from the home, storing weapons unloaded and in a locked compartment) would appear to be effective but have not been studied adequately. Receipt of firearm training (usually covering firearm storage) has been associated with an increased likelihood of storing guns loaded and unlocked.59 It is unknown whether this increase was because the training was ineffective, did not teach appropriate storage, or was received by persons who were inherently less likely to store firearms safely than were those who did not receive training. The association between firearm availability and violent injury is discussed in Chapters 50 and 59. A substantial proportion of childhood poisonings can be prevented by keeping medications in child-resistant containers. Federal legislation requiring such containers for aspirin, acetaminophen, prescription drugs, and household chemicals has been associated with a subsequent decrease in childhood poisoning from these substances.6264 Poisoning with children's aspirin has also been reduced by limiting the number of tablets packaged in each bottle.62,65 In contrast, poison-warning labels designed for children do not appear to be efficacious. Controlled trials have demonstrated that poison warning stickers (such as the ""Mr. Yuk"" series) do not deter children from playing with medication containers66 or reduce the rate of childhood poisoning.67 The use of aversive bittering agents may reduce ingestion of the substance to which the agent was added, 68,69 but the ability of these agents to reduce the incidence or severity of childhood poisoning is unproven. 70 Bicycling injuries are important causes of morbidity and mortality, particularly among school-age children.22 Nearly half of all Americans and 8090% of U.S. children ride bicycles.71,71a Potential interventions include wearing safety helmets, having bicycle safety training, and avoiding riding near motor vehicle traffic. Between 50% and 85% of bicycle fatalities and hospitalizations are the result of head trauma.22,72,73 Cross-sectional stud ies of persons involved in bicycling crashes suggest that bicycle helmets reduce head injuries by at least 40%.7477 Case-control studies estimate that the risk of head injury among bicyclists is reduced by 6385% by the use of bicycle helmets.78,79 Control for factors such as estimated crash severity, motor vehicle involvement, non-head injury severity, rider experience or age, or other sociodemographic characteristics, did not eliminate the pro tective effect of bicycle helmets found in these studies.78,79 In multiple time-series studies, mandatory bicycle helmet use laws and communitybased education programs have been associated with substantial increases in helmet use and with reductions in bicycle-related fatalities, head-injuries, and hospitalizations.8084 These studies provide strong support for the routine use of helmets while bicycling.   664  Section II:Counseling  An additional potential intervention to prevent bicycling injuries, bicy cle safety training, is suggested by surveys showing that many bicycle crashes among children result from cyclist error. 79,8587 One small controlled trial in children aged 89 years reported a positive short-term effect of training on bicycling behavior,88 but no controlled studies have evaluated the effectiveness of formal training in preventing crashes or injury. A recommendation for counseling bicyclists to avoid riding near motor vehicle traffic is based on evidence that some 95% of bicycle fatalities occur as a result of a collision with a motor vehicle.72,73 Efforts to separate bicyclists from motor vehicle traffic, such as designated bicycle lanes and paths, have met with some success in reducing bicycle crashes,89 although a metaanalysis based on cross-sectional and before-after studies suggested that bicycle paths may increase the risk to bicyclists at certain intersections.90 In children under age 5, falls are a common cause of injury, although few of these injuries lead to death or permanent sequelae.9,91 These injuries often involve falls from stairs or furniture.92 Baby walkers are an im portant cause of injuries in young children, many of which result from falls down stairs.9395 Collapsible gates have been advocated as a means of protecting children from stairways,92 although the efficacy of stairway gates has not been studied. Children can fall from windows even when there are screens in place. There is evidence that window guards can reduce child falls from apartment windows. 96 Adolescents and Adults. Intoxication with alcohol or other drugs and problem drinking are important risk factors for injuries and injury deaths.9,29,97104 In addition to its role in motor vehicle crashes, which has been most thoroughly studied (see Chapter 57), alcohol intoxication is involved in 40% of all fatal fires and burns and an estimated 2550% of adolescent and adult deaths from drowning, boating mishaps, and shootings, and is also associated with asphyxiation by choking.9,10,47,105108 Problem drinking by mothers has been associated with increased risk of serious injury in their children.108a Chronic alcohol abuse is a risk factor for poorer health outcome when trauma does occur.109 In national surveys, 30% of all high-school students had had five or more drinks on at least one occasion (i.e., episodic heavy drinking) during the preceding 30 days,110 and 5% of adults reported regular heavy drinking (more than five drinks per day more than five times per week).111 The large body of evidence linking alcohol intoxication to injuries, and the high prevalence of heavy drinking, argues strongly for screening for problem drinking (see Chapter 52) and for counseling on the safe use of alcohol as important measures to prevent injuries. The highest unintentional poisoning mortality rate occurs in young adult   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  665  men (2039 years of age), who account for 40% of unintentional poisoning deaths.112 A large proportion of these deaths are attributable to overdoses of alcohol, heroin, and cocaine,9,112 at least some of which may be preventable by identification and treatment of problem drinking and illicit drug abuse (see Chapters 52 and 53). Intentional self-poisoning is discussed in Chapter 50. Drownings of adolescents and adults are most common among young males, and occur under different circumstances from those of toddlers.18,19,47,113 Most such drowning occurs in lakes, rivers, and ponds in association with water activities, including swimming, diving, boating, and fishing.47,113,114 The highest rate of fatal recreational boating incidents occurs in adolescents (8.1/million operator-hours compared to 1.0/million for all ages).115 Intoxication by alcohol or other drugs is common in both drowning and boating mishaps; about 2550% of all victims have a significant blood alcohol level, and as many as 10% have evidence of other drugs with central nervous system effects.47,113,116,117 In a national survey of adolescents and adults who participated in aquatic activities, 42% had used alcohol during such activities, with males aged 1620 reporting the highest level of alcohol consumption.118 Discouraging swimming or boating while intoxicated would therefore appear to be appropriate, but there has been little research on the impact of such a clinical intervention. More than three fourths of boating-related drownings are associated with nonuse of personal flotation devices,119 but there are few data on the impact of promoting the use of these devices. Higher rates of fatal recreational boating incidents have been associated with fewer hours of operator experience, suggesting that supervised experience and training programs might be beneficial in preventing drowning, but these have not been evaluated.115 Swimming lessons may also offer some protection against drowning, but this has never been proved convincingly. Most unintentional injuries from firearms involve adolescent and young adult males, with the highest rate of unintentional firearm deaths (3.4/100,000) occurring in males aged 1524.1,21 Unintentional firearm death rates are 4 times higher in rural compared with suburban and urban settings,9 which probably reflects increased gun ownership for hunting and recreation.120 After the home, where at least 65% of unintentional firearm injuries occur (see Children, above), the most common location for unintentional firearm injuries is the hunting site.10 In 1987, 9.2 firearm injuries were reported per 100,000 hunting licenses sold.121 These incidents often involve members of the same hunting party and result from accidental discharge or unsafe handling of the firearm, and from the victim being out of sight or mistaken for game.53,123 In a small sample of unintentional self-inflicted hunting fatalities, one third of victims had positive blood alcohol concentrations.123 National data suggest that one-fourth of injured hunters are <21 years of   666  Section II:Counseling  age.121 One population-based study found that 40% of shooters in hunting accidents were less than 20 years of age and fewer than half were supervised by adults; unsafe hunting practices such as carrying the firearm incorrectly were significantly more common in shooters who were 819 years of age.123 Hunting firearm injuries might be reduced by adult supervision of child and adolescent hunters and by wearing fluorescent orange clothing while hunting to increase visibility, but the effectiveness of these measures has not been studied adequately. Education programs for hunters on the safe use of firearms have had mixed effects on fatality rates.53 Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of fire and burn injuries and fatalities.29,124,124a Cigarette smoking causes about 25% of residential fires, usually through unintentional ignition of bedding or upholstery. Smoke detectors are effective interventions for preventing fire and burn injuries and deaths in adults as well as children (see Children, above). Many advocate counseling regarding careless smoking practices and the promotion of self-extinguishing cigarettes, neither of which has been adequately evaluated. Bicycle deaths and head injuries remain an important problem in older adolescents and young adults, with nearly 400 deaths and more than 150,000 injuries occurring each year among persons aged 1539.22 Use of bicycle helmets is an effective preventive intervention (see Children, above), yet only 7% of older adolescents and 18% of all bicyclists wear bicycle helmets sometimes or always.110,124b ATV injuries primarily occur in adolescence and young adulthood. A multivariate analysis based on nationally reported data on ATV injuries suggested that given a crash resulting in injury, helmet use reduces the risk of death by about 42%.125 Similar analyses have reported reduced risks from ATVs with smaller engines and four rather than three wheels.125,126 In 1987, the marketing and sale of three-wheeled ATVs was banned (although those already in use were not recalled), changes were made in marketing to reduce sales of larger-engined machines to children and adolescents, and educational features such as safety warnings and rebates for safety education were introduced.127 These interventions have been associated with a decline in injury rates (but not fatalities).127 Elderly Adults. Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries and unintentional injury deaths in older persons in the U.S.9,10 Physiological changes with age and environmental agents are the principal risk factors for falls in older persons. Among the physiological factors that have been associated with falls are postural instability, gait disturbances, diminished muscle strength and proprioception, poor vision, cognitive impairment, number of medications, and the use of psychoactive and antihypertensive drugs.11,128136 Frail elderly persons, who have multiple physiologic deficiencies, are at significantly increased risk for falls compared with vigorous older persons.137 Environmen-   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  667  tal risk factors identified retrospectively by fallers as contributory include stairs, pavement irregularities, slippery surfaces (including loose rugs), inadequate lighting, unexpected objects, low chairs, and incorrect footwear.128,129,138140 Controlled studies have not consistently reported significant associations between falls and environmental hazards when adjustments are made for other risk factors;128130,137 several studies suggest that risk from home hazards may vary with underlying functional status.137,141 Among the risk factors associated with injury after a fall are osteoporosis (see Chapter 46), syncope, impaired cognitive function, use of diuretics or vasodilators, and falling on hard surfaces such as concrete.129,134,142 These physiological and environmental risk factors for falls and fall injuries serve as the basis for potential preventive interventions: exercise programs to enhance strength, balance and mobility; external protection against falls on hard surfaces; monitoring and adjustment of medications; correction of environmental hazards; and measures to increase bone density (see Chapters 46 and 68). Several trials have evaluated the ability of various measures to reduce falls or risk factors for falls. The efficacy of these measures in preventing fall injuries and consequent deterioration in ambulatory function has not been fully evaluated. Randomized controlled trials of exercise programs for elderly persons have generally shown improved strength and mobility; effects on balance have been less consistent.143148 Two controlled trials of exercise programs for elderly ambulatory or institutionalized persons found no reduction in falls (although this was not a primary outcome in the latter study).143,144 These exercise programs may have been inadequate, however, since neither study reported significantly improved strength or balance as a result of the intervention. A preplanned meta-analysis of individual data from seven randomized controlled trials concluded that interventions that included an exercise component reduced the adjusted risk of falling by 10% in elderly subjects.149 Of the exercise components studied (resistance, balance, endurance, flexibility), only balance training had a significant individual effect on risk of falls. The types and modes of exercise were not standardized across trials, however. Since fall assessment was based on self-report and patients were not blinded to the intervention, the possibility of biased results exists. The meta-analysis suggested a slight nonsignificant increase in the risk of injurious falls with exercise; neither the individual trials nor the meta-analysis had sufficient sample size to assess adequately the effect of exercise on injurious falls. Only one study has evaluated external protection against falls on hard surfaces. In a trial evaluating external hip protectors fixed in special undergarments, the risk of hip fracture was reduced by 56% among elderly men and women who were resident on nursing home wards that were randomly assigned to receive the protectors.150 None of the eight intervention subjects   668  Section II:Counseling  who had a hip fracture wore the protectors at the time of the fracture; compliance with regular wearing was only 24%. Ward assignment of new arrivals could have been influenced by knowledge of the ward intervention status, potentially invalidating the randomization. There were no differences in nonhip fracture rates in the two groups, however, or in the rates of falls or falls on hips in a subset of intervention and control wards that used a prospective falls register, supporting the validity of the results. Several trials have evaluated multifactorial interventions to reduce falls and fall injury rates in elderly adults, targeted to a variety of physiologic and environmental risk factors. In a randomized controlled trial in community-dwelling persons aged 70 or older, the intervention group received medication review and adjustment, behavioral instruction and training, environmental alterations (e.g., installation of grab bars), and exercise to improve gait, balance, and strength; the interventions were delivered during multiple home visits by a nurse practitioner and a physical therapist over a 3-month period.151 Controls received a similar number of structured home visits from social-work students. At 1-year follow-up, the intervention group had a significantly longer time to first fall, smaller proportion of subjects who fell (35% vs. 47%), and lower incidence of falls (0.012 vs. 0.018 falls/person-week), with favorable trends for falls requiring medical care and falls resulting in serious injury. In multivariate analy sis, the risk of falling declined by 11% for each 1.0 decrease in the number of fall-related risk factors. No adverse effects from the intervention were reported except self-limited musculoskeletal symptoms in 7% of subjects. In the institutional setting, multidisciplinary postfall assessment designed to address a variety of risk factors for falls substantially reduced subsequent falls in a small uncontrolled experiment. 152 A randomized controlled trial of postfall assessment in a nursing home, however, found little effect on falls.153 The assessment did significantly reduce hospitalizations and hospital days, suggesting that falls served mainly as a marker for treatable underlying disorders. Additional trials related to preventing falls and fall injuries in elderly persons are currently under way.154 Another leading cause of unintentional injury death in persons over 65 years of age is asphyxiation by choking from foreign materials in the respiratory tract, with 2,500 deaths annually, including 270 in institutions.9 Poor dentition, use of sedative drugs, dementia, and reduced motor coordination may contribute to this high rate.9 Interventions such as correcting denture fit, adjusting medications, dietary changes related to food size and consistency, and training those who care for elderly persons in use of the Heimlich maneuver and cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be effective interventions, but data evaluating these or other interventions to prevent aspiration and asphyxiation are lacking.   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  669  Fires and burns are also leading causes of death in older adults.9,155 Compared with younger hospitalized burn victims, the mortality rate is higher for elderly hospitalized burn patients (0.4 vs. 2.6 deaths/100,000 person-years).156 The risk of fatality in the event of a house fire is significantly increased when persons over 65 years old are present in the household.29 Older persons may be at increased risk of dying in residential fires because of impaired vision, hearing, mobility, or mental status, which can lead to greater difficulty in avoiding burns.29 More than three fourths of deaths from clothing ignition occur among persons aged 65 and older, which may be due in part to decreased coordination in handling cigarettes, lighters, etc.9,155 Smoking materials have been implicated in 10% of severe burn injuries and 33% of residential-fire deaths among elderly persons.26,156 Scald burns account for 42% of hospitalizations for burn injuries in persons aged 65 years and older and primarily involve hot tap water, food, and drinks.156 Interventions similar to those discussed for children and younger adults are likely to be effective in preventing fire and burn injuries in elderly adults (see above). Efforts to improve mobility, coordination, and sensory function may also be effective in reducing burn injuries, although these have not been evaluated. Effectiveness of Counseling The most effective measures to control injuries are passive interventions, those that do not rely on the potential victim to adopt new behaviors voluntarily. Examples of effective passive interventions include window guards in high-rise apartments, nonflammable sleepwear, automatic sprinkler systems, and child-resistant packaging to prevent poisoning.157 Since injury prevention advice from clinicians usually requires active cooperation from patients (e.g., changing smoking practices in bed, installing and testing smoke detectors), counseling faces inherent limitations. It is there fore not surprising that counseling is most effective in combination with other measures that promote compliance, such as safety regulations.96,158 Children. Clinical counseling by itself appears to be of some benefit when offered to parents of young children. 159 Only a few studies have evaluated the effects of counseling on injury rates as well as on knowledge and behavior. A small randomized controlled trial found that parents who received an individualized course on child safety during well-baby visits demonstrated greater knowledge about home hazards and had fewer hazards in the home when tested 1 month after the last visit; there was no difference in the rate of injuries reported by the parents or recorded in hospital records. 160 A nonrandomized controlled trial found that infants   670  Section II:Counseling  of mothers who received counseling on fall prevention had fewer falls over the course of a year than did those whose mothers were not counseled.161 In a controlled demonstration project, clinical counseling resulted in significantly improved knowledge and behavior related to poisoning prevention, but had no effect on poisoning rates.162 In a w ell- designed prospective cohort study, the children of urban, adolescent mothers who reported having received home safety information at 3 months postpartum were half as likely to have been injured at follow-up about 1 year later.163 There was a dose-response relationship between the number of home safety information sources and reduced injury risk; 71% reported receiving their information from health professionals. Several ecologic studies that included both primary care and community interventions have reported improvements in safety knowledge and behavior compared to con trol communities; significant improvements or favorable trends in injury rates were also reported in the intervention communities.164166 A number of other trials have assessed behavioral outcomes related to injury prevention. A randomized controlled trial found that couples who received information on burn prevention during well-child care classes were more likely to have their hot water heaters set at 130F or lower when checked by investigators during a home visit. 167 In a nonrandomized trial, parents who received counseling along with the opportunity to purchase a smoke detector at cost were more likely to have an operational smoke detector 46 weeks later, compared with controls.168 In another small nonrandomized trial of low-income parents, those who received detailed safety advice during a home visit by a health worker were found to have corrected significantly more home hazards compared to controls.169 Education has also been shown to motivate parents to obtain syrup of ipecac, to display poison control center telephone numbers, and to learn more about the proper use of ipecac.170172 Thus, the evidence supports a beneficial effect of clinician counseling on safety-related knowledge and behavior. It is less clear from direct evidence whether counseling results in lower injury rates. Not all studies have found counseling parents to be effective in promoting safety. One randomized controlled trial found that a program providing mothers with counseling on household hazards, a safety booklet, and free safety devices was unsuccessful in changing either the knowledge of the subjects or the number of home hazards detected in an unannounced home visit, although in this study the counseling was administered by a research assistant rather than a clinician.173 To be effective, safety counseling may have to be provided by the patient's own clinician, as suggested by one descriptive study.174 A population-based nonrandomized controlled trial found little effect on preventive behaviors of a brief nurse counseling intervention, but contamination of the comparison group may have occurred   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  671  because the same nurses saw study and control groups in alternating weeks.175 The limited benefit from parent counseling reported in these studies may therefore have been due to their methodologic limitations. Some researchers have attempted to prevent childhood injuries through free distribution of injury control devices during the clinic visit. When free smoke detectors were made available in one program, 92% of the recipients installed the devices and 88% of these were found to be operational 49 months later.176 Distributing a liquid-crystal thermometer along with office counseling increased the likelihood of testing tap water temperature compared to counseling alone, but both groups were equally likely to report lowering the thermostat.177 In another study, free distribution of cabinet locks and electrical outlet covers resulted in increased use of outlet covers, which are easy to apply, but no increase in the installation of cabinet locks, a more inconvenient task requiring minimal carpentry skills.178 Similarly, providing a free slide-style cabinet lock and telephone stickers significantly increased their use, while a discount coupon for syrup of ipecac (which required a visit to a pharmacy to purchase) did not increase the likelihood of having ipecac on hand.179 Adolescents and Adults. Evidence on counseling to prevent household and recreational injuries to adolescents and young or middle-aged adults is quite limited. Two randomized controlled trials directed to young adolescents and their parents evaluated brief physician counseling addressing awareness of bicycling injury risk and helmet efficacy and found only a slight, nonsignificant increase in bicycle helmet purchases.180,181 The counseling intervention was designed primarily to increase awareness and was probably inadequate to induce behavioral change (see Chapter iv). A comprehensive review revealed no other studies specifically evaluating household or recreational injury prevention counseling of adolescents or younger adults in the primary care setting. Counseling middle-aged men who were heavy drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption substantially reduced hospital days for accidents and injuries at 25-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial,182 although it is not clear whether this was due to a reduction in injury events or in complications once an injury occurred. The effectiveness of identifying and counseling persons with problem drinking is described in detail in Chapter 52. Elderly Adults . A number of trials have evaluated counseling elders to reduce the risk of household and other unintentional injuries, although none involved counseling within the context of the routine office visit. A randomized controlled trial enrolling public health clients 65 years compared the effects of safety education (including falls prevention and fire safety) delivered during a public health nurse home visit to control (influenza) education delivered in the same manner.183 At 23-month follow-up, there   672  Section II:Counseling  were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of subjects reporting they had made safety changes in the home (22% vs. 18%) or in the mean number of safety changes made (0.35 vs. 0.26). Effects on injuries were not assessed. Three randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effects of counseling interventions on falls and fall injuries, one involving home visits and two conducted among elderly volunteers belonging to health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A large trial conducted within a general practice randomly assigned all households with patients aged 70 years and older to usual care or to receive a home health visit at least once a year that included risk assessment for falls; counseling on diet, medications, syncope, and environmental hazards; referrals as needed; and weekly fitness classes.184 At 4-year follow-up, there were no differences between intervention and control groups in the proportions who reported falls (28% vs. 20%) or fractures due to falls (5% vs. 4%) during the study period. One HMO trial evaluated the effects of four weekly, 90-minute group counseling sessions led by a health behaviorist and a physical therapist and focused on exercise and measures to reduce environmental hazards and behavioral risks, followed by quarterly maintenance sessions; financial and technical assistance to make safety repairs was also offered.185 The intervention reduced the odds of falling by 15%, but had little effect on the probability or number of injury falls or of falls requiring medical treatment. Neither the odds of falling nor number of falls was significantly related to the number of sessions attended by intervention subjects, but analysis suggested that those with a higher underlying fall risk were more likely to attend. The other HMO trial randomly assigned 1559 elderly volunteers to one of three groups: usual care, a 6090-minute visit with a nurse to discuss chronic disease prevention, or a 6090-minute visit with a nurse/educator who performed fall-related risk assessment and screening, developed tailored recommendations for preventing falls (e.g., medication review, exercise, alcoholism treatment, home safety inspection), and made 12 follow-up calls.186 Compared to usual care, the intervention significantly reduced the percentage of subjects reporting falls and injurious falls, with favorable trends for medically attended and hospitalized falls, at 1-year follow-up, but differences disappeared by the end of 2 years. It is unclear how much of the reduction in falls at 1-year follow-up can be attributed to the intervention: similar reductions were seen in the control nurse visit group, and the intervention had no effect on the prevalence of any fall-related behaviors except the receipt of a home safety inspection. Whether the effects of home visits or of fairly intensive interventions in volunteers who belong to HMOs can be extrapolated to routine clinician counseling in the office setting is unclear. In all three of the trials assessing fall outcomes, falls were self-reported, possibly leading to biased reporting of falls due to knowledge of intervention assignment.   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  673  Adverse Effects of Injury Prevention Counseling. Injury prevention counseling has not been associated with adverse effects in any trials. Concern has been raised that injury control counseling may be harmful in some patients, such as adolescents. 53 Several investigators have hypothesized that adolescents who favor risk-taking behavior may respond to certain health information (i.e., drug and sex education) by performing activities that increase risk, 187189 but no direct evidence to support this hypothesis, either for injury or other conditions, was found.  Recommendations of Other Groups Specific recommendations for office-based counseling on household and recreational injury prevention have been issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics,190 the American Academy of Family Physicians,191 the Bright Futures project, 192 the American Medical Association Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS),193 and the Public Health Service.193a Clinicians are advised by these groups to provide age-specific injury prevention counseling, which may include the following: install and maintain smoke detectors in the home, safely store matches and lighters and avoid smoking near bedding or upholstery; set hot water temperatures to 120130F; install window and stairway guards/gates and discourage use of infant walkers; supervise young children in the bathtub and all children when swimming, install isolation fences around swimming pools, learn CPR, learn how to swim, and avoid alcohol use during water-related activities; avoid keeping guns or keep guns unloaded and stored in locked cabinets separate from ammunition; purchase and use bicycle helmets; safely store medicines and household products and acquire syrup of ipecac; correct home hazards related to falls; and follow other recommendations on injury prevention. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends injury prevention counseling on safety helmets, recreational hazards, and firearms for all women.193b The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all persons wear bicycle helmets whenever and wherever they ride a bicycle.194 The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination recommends counseling parents to recognize home hazards, use smoke detectors and nonflammable sleepwear, reduce hot water thermostat settings, keep ipecac on hand, and know the poison control center telephone number, but it found insufficient evidence to recommend parent counseling to prevent drowning or bicycling injuries.195 The Canadian Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against counseling adults (other than parents) to prevent household and recreational injuries.   674  Section II:Counseling  Discussion There is good evidence from controlled trials that counseling the parents of young children can increase safety-related behaviors (e.g., lowering hot water temperatures, reducing home hazards, installing smoke detectors), and fair evidence from multiple observational studies that certain safety behaviors are associated with reduced childhood injuries. A chain of evidence can thus be constructed to support a recommendation that parents of children be counseled to prevent household and recreational injuries, even though the evidence is less strong for a direct effect of clinician safety counseling on injury rates. There is clearly room for substantial improvement in the implementation of childhood injury prevention measures: in a national survey of households with children, only 67% had functional smoke detectors, 50% knew the Poison Control Center number, 26% had ipecac on hand, and 9% had hot water temperature known to be below 125F.196 The prevalence of all these measures decreased with decreasing level of education and income. High cost and limited access to recommended protective devices,197 the need for technical skills to install certain devices, and living in rental units should be recognized as important barriers to implementing childhood injury prevention advice that particularly affect low-income households. No trials of counseling or other interventions in elderly adults have demonstrated significant reductions in serious fall injuries, but there is strong observational evidence of the association between falls and mortality and serious morbidity in the elderly, indicating that interventions that reduce falls are likely to improve clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials indicates that exercise (especially balance training) can reduce the risk of falls in elderly persons by about 10%. An intensive multifactorial intervention that directly addressed physiologic and environmental risk factors during regular home visits also reduced the likelihood of falling in high-risk community-dwelling elders, although substantial resources were required that may not be available in all settings. Whether clinician advice to exercise or to address fall risk factors will reduce falls or fall injuries is less clear. Weekly group counseling sessions or detailed individualized counseling by health workers trained to address physiological, behavioral, and environmental risk factors leads to modest short-term reductions in fall risk. These interventions may not be generalizable to brief advice delivered in the office setting, however, and direct evidence of a reduction in fall injuries with counseling is lacking. Periodic counseling of elderly persons to exercise and to address environmental and behavioral risk factors for falls is thus supported by fair evidence that these measures will reduce falls and thereby reduce fall-related injuries, although the effectiveness of counseling patients to exercise and to address these risk factors has not been established. There is fair evidence to   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  675  recommend an intensive multifactorial fall prevention intervention for community-dwelling elders at high risk for falls, in settings where adequate resources to deliver this intervention are available. In institutionalized elderly persons, there is evidence from one trial that the use of external hip protectors reduces hip fracture rates. Confirmation of these results is needed, but the large potential benefit and lack of adverse effects support their use. At present, such protectors are not widely available nor have these devices been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Compliance with wearing the protectors was poor in institutionalized elderly. Whether community-dwelling elders would comply with wearing similar protectors is questionable; further research to address compliance is therefore necessary. Postfall as ses sment and multifactorial intervention for institutionalized elderly does not appear to reduce falls, but can be recommended on the basis of other significant health benefits unrelated to injuries. Although there are few injury control measures for adolescents and younger adults for which there is conclusive evidence of efficacy, and the effectiveness of injury control counseling of adults is largely unstudied, counseling by physicians on these matters may be justified because of the enormous burden of suffering associated with injuries. Thus, even minor reductions in their incidence can have large public health benefits. The cost of physician time to deliver injury prevention counseling may be kept to a minimum by conducting counseling during clinical encounters and focusing attention on specific injuries for which the patient is at greatest risk and on preventive strategies for which the strongest evidence of efficacy is available. For adolescents and adults, intoxication by alcohol and other drugs appears to be most strongly associated with the risk of unintentional injury or death, and there is fair evidence that counseling for problem drinking is effective (see Chapter 52). Additional measures likely to prevent household and recreational injuries to adolescents and adults include smoking cessation (see Chapter 54), proper installation and testing of smoke detectors, and wearing bicycle and ATV safety helmets. The solutions to many injury problems may require intervention both at the individual level (i.e., in the clinical setting) and at the community, state or national level. There are numerous examples of public health education programs and legislation that have proved effective in promoting safe behavior and preventing injuries.36,39,64,80,81,84,96,198,199 Measures likely to be even more effective in preventing injuries involve re-engineering the household environment or products (e.g., residential sprinkler systems, hot water heaters preset to 125 at the factory32,34), because these measures do not depend on voluntary behavior changes. Such re-engineering can also be achieved through legislation. In many communities, physicians and other health professionals have provided leadership for effective commu-   676  Section II:Counseling  nity programs and legislation to reduce injury morbidity and mortality.39,64,200,201 Clinicians may wish to consider playing an advocacy role as a means of preventing household and recreational injuries, while continuing to support behavior change with clinical interventions. CLINICAL INTERVENTION  Counseling the parents of children on measures to reduce the risk of unintentional injuries from residential fires and hot tap water, drowning, poisoning, bicycling, firearms, and falls is reco mmended (""B"" recommendation). Persons with alcohol or drug problems should be iden tified, counseled, and monitored, and referred for treatment as appropri ate (see Chapters 52 and 53); all adolescents and adults who use alcohol or other drugs should be advised to avoid engaging in potentially dangerous activities (e.g., swimming, boating, handling of firearms, smoking in bed, hunting, bicycling) while intoxicated (""B"" recommendation). Counseling regarding other measures to prevent household and recreational injuries is recommended for adolescent and adult (including elderly) patients based on fair evidence for the efficacy of risk reduction (""B"" recommen dation), although the effectiveness of such counseling has not been adequately evaluated (""C"" recommendation). The need to prevent household or recreational injuries should be discussed regularly with patients, although the optimal frequency for such counseling has not been deter mined and is left to clinical discretion. Clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of abuse or neglect as the etiology of certain household and recreational injuries (see Chapter 51). Illicit drug use, an important risk factor for adolescent and adult poisonings, is discussed in Chapter 53. See also Chapter 50 (suicide), Chapter 57 (motor vehicle and pedestrian in juries), and Chapter 59 (violent injuries). Specific recommendations to prevent injuries to children include the following measures, many of which are also likely to be effective in pre venting injuries to adolescents and adults (including elderly persons). Homeowners should be advised to install smoke detectors in appropriate locations and to test the devices periodically to ensure proper operation. Infants and children should wear flame-resistant nightwear during sleep. Smokers should be advised to cease or reduce smoking (see Chapter 54). Hot water heaters should be set at 120130F. Parents, grandparents, or other patients with children in the home should be advised to keep a 1ounce bottle of syrup of ipecac, to display the telephone number of the local poison control center, and to place all medications, toxic substances, and matches in child-resistant containers. Bicyclists and parents of children who ride bicycles should be counseled about the importance of wearing approved safety helmets 194 and avoiding riding in motor vehicle   Chapter 58: Preventing Household/Recreational Injuries  677  traffic. Children and adolescents who ride all-terrain vehicles, and their parents, should be advised to use approved safety helmets and fourwheeled (rather than three-wheeled) machines with smaller engines. Fam ilies should be encouraged to install 4-foot four-sided isolation fences with self-latching, self-closing gates around swimming pools, and window guards on windows in buildings that pose high risk for falls. Swimming pool owners and individuals living with or caring for young children or elderly persons should be encouraged to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation and maneuvers to manage choking incidents. Although there is at present only limited evidence to support removing firearms from the home or keeping them unloaded in a locked compartment for the preven tion of unintentional injuries, this intervention can be recommended based on its efficacy for the prevention of violent injuries (see Chapters 50 and 59). Additional interventions likely to be effective but for which there is currently limited evidence of benefit include: avoiding smoking near bedding or upholstery and unsafe handling of smoking materials, installing collapsible gates or other barriers to stairway entrances, observing safe boating practices and wearing personal flotation devices while boat ing, and wearing orange fluorescent clothing while hunting. Poison-warn ing stickers intended to deter children from playing with containers of medicine or other poisons (e.g., ""Mr. Yuk"" stickers) have been found to be ineffective and are not recommended (""D"" recommendation). Counseling elderly patients on measures to reduce the risk of falling, including exercise (particularly training to improve balance), safety-related skills and behaviors, and environmental hazard reduction, along with monitoring and adjusting medications, is recommended based on fair evidence that these measures reduce the likelihood of falling (""B"" recom mendation), although the effectiveness of routinely counseling elders to prevent falls has not been adequately evaluated (""C"" recommendation). Recommendations for regular physical activity in elderly patients without contraindications can also be made based on other proven benefits (see Chapter 55). Intensive individualized home-based multifactorial intervention to reduce the risk of falls is recommended for high-risk elderly pa tients in settings where adequate resources are available to deliver such services (""B"" recommendation). Elderly persons at high risk for falls in clude those aged 75 years and older; or aged 7074 with one or more additional risk factors including: use of certain psychoactive and cardiac medications (e.g., benzodiazepines, antihypertensives); use of 4 prescription medications; impaired cognition, strength, balance, or gait. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of external hip protectors to prevent fall injuries (""C"" recommendation). Once these devices become generally available, recommendations for   678  Section II:Counseling  their use in institutionalized elderly may be made on other grounds, in cluding the large potential benefit and limited adverse effects. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against postfall assessment and intervention in institutionalized elderly persons in order to prevent falls (""C"" recommendation), but recommendations for such interventions may be made on the basis of other benefits, including reduced hospitalizations and hospital days unrelated to falls. For other recommendations relevant to fall injuries in the elderly, see Chapter 33 (screening for visual impair ment), Chapter 46 (screening for postmenopausal osteoporosis), Chapter 48 (screening for dementia), Chapter 55 (counseling to promote physical activity), and Chapter 68 (hormone replacement therapy).

During the period 1990-94, Spain produced around 84,000 million cigarettes per year and imported around 1,800 million cigarettes. From 1993-94, Spain exported around 2,500 million cigarettes per year. In 1992, Spain received US$ 117 million in tobaccogrowing subsidies from the EU. In 1993, Spain spent around US$ 350 million (0.32% of total import costs) on tobacco products, while earning around US$ 41 million (0.04% of total export earnings) from tobacco.    Industry  In 1993, Spain's stateowned tobacco company had a staff of around 7,850 employees. Government revenue from tobacco taxes in 1993 was US$ 2.8 billion.       Tobacco consumption    The majority of tobacco consumed in Spain is in the form of manufactured cigarettes. A relatively small amount of finecut tobacco is sold in Spain. During the period 1990-92, annual adult (age 15+) per capita consumption averaged around 2,670, an increase form the early 1970s, when it averaged around 2,190. However, it has been estimated that by 1993, per capita consumption had fallen to around 2,400. However, this apparent decline may be explained largely by a reported increase in sales of smuggled cigarettes.                               Consumption of Manufactured Cigarettes                                                    Annual average per adult (15+)                                1970-72                     2,190                                1980-82                     2,440                                1990-92                     2,670                 Tar/nicotine/ filters  According to EU legislation, cigarettes have to contain less than 15 mg of tar from 1993 and will have to contain less than 12 mg of tar from 1998. In 1994, 98% of the cigarettes produced in Spain were filter-tipped.    Relative cost of cigarettes  The average hourly gross salary for an industrial worker in 1992 was US$ 8.40, enough to buy 13 packs of cigarettes. Thus, it would take only around 5 minutes of labour to purchase a pack of 20 cigarettes. In 1995, relative to the cost of living, cigarettes in Spain were the cheapest in the EU.       Prevalence    National smoking prevalence has declined from 40% in 1978 to 36% in 1993. However, in the same period, the percentage of male smokers declined from 65% to 48%, but the prevalence of smoking among women increased from 17% to 25%.    Tobacco use among population sub-groups  A 1986 survey in Catalonia found a smoking prevalence among physicians of 52%. Among women, smoking prevalence appears to increase in conjunction with socio-economic status.    Age patterns  In 1993, smoking prevalence was highest among men in the 25-44 year age group (57%). Among women, smoking rates were highest among 18-24 year olds (38%), and among 25-44 year olds (34%). Smoking was far less common among women over the age of 45 years, with only 9% of women aged 45-65 smoking (compared to 44% of men in the same age group.          Mortality from Tobacco Use    Around 1950, the absolute level of male and female lung cancer rates in Spain was very similar )10/100,000 for males, 5/100,000 for females). By 1991, the rate for women had remained unchanged (at about the level of non-smoking women in populations where data are available), whereas lung cancer mortality among men had risen seven-fold to almost 79/100,000. Moreover, lung cancer in Spanish men is continuing to increase rapidly, as is the number of smoking attributable deaths. In 1995, an estimated 46,000 men died from tobacco, up from 7,200 in 1955. Between 1950 and 2000, it is estimated that tobacco will have been the cause of about 1,250,000 deaths among Spanish men, almost 700,000 of which occurred before age 70 years.            Tobacco control measures    Control of tobacco products  Tobacco advertising is banned on television and radio, but radio advertising is allowed for new lowtar and lownicotine brands for a two year period following the launch. Voluntary restrictions agreed up by the Minister of Health and representatives of the tobacco industry also contain some provisions: a ban on sales of tobacco to children under 16 years; ban of the sale of tobacco in health or educational establishments, or any establishment especially aimed at children or young people; ban on the use of vending machines by children under age 16; cigarette vending machines must carry a health warning of a specified size. Sales of oral tobacco products have been banned since 1992. The EU legislation on labelling, with mandatory health warnings and listing of tar and nicotine contents, has been implemented into Spanish law. In 1995, taxes on cigarettes represented 72% of the retail price.    Protection for non-smokers  Smoking is banned in such public places as health facilities, educational establishments, public administration premises, welfare establishments for children under age 16, premises for public entertainment, urban and long-distance vehicles, domestic flights shorter than 90 minutes, and in workplaces where smoking may pose an increased health risk such as for pregnant women.    Health Education  Ministry of Health activities on tobacco are carried out as part of the Health for All programmes in Spain. The main objective is to reduce smoking prevalence by at least 18% by the year 2000. The National Plan on Prevention and Control of Cancer also includes measures against tobacco use. The Ministry of Health enlists the cooperation of other Ministries in its tobacco activities However, Spain consists of 17 autonomous regions, making a national approach to tobacco control difficult. In the mid 1990s, pilot programmes aimed at reducing smoking in schools, workplaces and the public health service are slowly gaining political interest and support. There is also focused attention on educating young people, pregnant women, teachers and health professionals about the dangers of smoking, and to support cessation efforts for those who smoke. Spain celebrates World No-Tobacco Day each year. In 1995, the National Committee for the Prevention of Tobacco Consumption was formed. The Spanish Association against Cancer also organizes activities aimed at reducing smoking.       Previous Country  |  Europe  |  Next Country
GX030-60-8047092	"Kyrgyzstan          >> Regional Overview    >> Kyrgyzstan Overview          Activity Data Sheet   PROGRAM:   Kyrgyzstan   TITLE & NUMBER:  Increased Utilization of Quality Primary Health Care for Select Populations, 116-032   STATUS:   New   PROPOSED FY 2001 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $2,300,000 FSA   PROPOSED FY 2002 OBLIGATION AND FUNDING SOURCE:   $2,600,000 FSA   INITIAL OBLIGATION:   FY 2001   ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE:   FY 2005    Summary : Kyrgyzstan is a leader in the Central Asia region in health care reform.  Through this strategic objective, USAID will continue build an effective, affordable, and sustainable primary health care (PHC) system, that meets the health needs of families and to strengthen programs for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases (ID). Health professionals are being re-trained to provide quality health care. Health professionals' clinical and laboratory skills will be upgraded to better diagnose, treat and prevent illness, including infectious diseases, such as acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis (TB), HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.    Program Categories  include support for infectious disease prevention, and maternal/child health.    Key Results : Four key results are necessary to achieve this objective : 1) select populations are better informed about personal health care rights and responsibilities; 2) improved quality of health care including infectious diseases and maternal and child health; 3) improved use of health care resources for primary health care; and 4) improved legislative, regulatory and policy framework.     Performance and Prospects : After six years of assistance, USAID continues to achieve outstanding results in the health sector. Exercising rights and responsibilities are themes that excite people in Kyrgyzstan who are participating in the changes in their health care system. Approximately one million citizens of Bishkek and Chui regions exercised their right to choose their doctors through USAID-supported re-enrollment campaigns in late 2000.     The Ministry of Health (MOH) is supporting citizens' rights to information as well as their right to comment on programs affecting them. In 2000 USAID assisted the MOH to develop a national public awareness campaign to inform the public about the next phase of health reform and to get people involved in the process. The population was educated about a new benefits package that identifies those essential services that the Government of Kyrgyzstan (GOKG) plans to provide without cost. Public comment was critical because the draft package listed services that the GOKG can realistically provide, rather than the universal free services that have been decreed but have not been free in years.    People are also becoming accustomed to receiving health information from their family doctors and nurses. In a recent Public Satisfaction Survey, 70% of respondents noticed improved health promotion work, 83% found an increase in the scope of services available to them in PHC and 61% noted improvement in the quality of services after family doctors were retrained and passed accreditation exams. Overall, 91% were satisfied with the services they received.    Updated training of health care personnel contributes to improved quality.  More than 1,400 physicians (most of whom are women) have completed a 2-year standard family medicine training program, passed exams, and been state-certified as family doctors.  This year, the Family Medicine Training Center launched a one-year residency program with 14 post- graduate students. In addition, through partnership activities, USAID assisted the Kyrgyzstan State Medical Academy to create new departments in health management and higher nursing education.    USAID initiated its efforts to improve the health care delivery system in Issyk-Kul Oblast six years ago, and the process is now well-advanced, including extensive training on acute respiratory infection (ARI) and control of diarrheal diseases, accompanied by monitoring of performance. For the first time in 10 years, ARI has dropped from first to second place as a cause of infant mortality, a trend that will be observed to determine whether it is sustained over time.    USAID assisted the Government to obtain Hepatitis B vaccine. This will enable the GOKG to decrease the levels of acute, chronic and fatal liver diseases by stopping transmission of Hepatitis B to infants. USAID continues to support strengthening of the National Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory and three sentinel surveillance sites that were established for disease specific surveillance, vaccination program monitoring and viral hepatitis control in Kyrgyzstan. This laboratory has received authority from the Ministry of Health to license local level infectious disease diagnostic laboratories to ensure the quality of the laboratory work. Through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-supported training, a core group of infectious disease professionals titled ""The Central Asian Epidemiology Network (CAR EPI NET)"" was established, strengthening capacity for surveillance and outbreak investigation, as well as training of trainers activities.    The GOKG continues to be a pioneer in health reform in the NIS. In the area of health finance, massive restructuring is taking place. At the district level, the Health Department has been abolished. Health purchaser and health provider functions have been split, with the Health Insurance Fund as the purchaser and the newly created oblast Merged General Hospital as the provider. The Merged General Hospital will incorporate specialty hospitals into its administrative structure as well as its physical plant, when feasible. This change has great potential to increase efficiency and decrease administrative and facility operating costs by eliminating duplication. In addition, two pilot budget projects are underway to create a single payer system by merging budget and health insurance funds into a single pool to allow greater flexibility to the purchaser in buying services.    At the national level, the Health Information Center has replaced the Health Statistics Department and been merged under the Health Insurance Fund so that health information systems are now tied to provider payment systems. This financial connection gives providers an incentive to submit good data that can be used for payments, health statistics, quality assurance, research and monitoring and evaluation. Other developments include an outpatient drug benefit being tested as part of the new proposed health benefits package. If successful, this could make drugs more accessible at the PHC level and decrease the motivation to hospitalize solely to obtain free drugs.    In 2001, with the benefit of additional funds, USAID will develop an HIV program prevention with a behavioral risk assessment, condom social marketing, a high-level regional conference, a pilot project to explore STI treatment approaches using the World Health Organization (WHO)-developed Syndromic Management approach, prevention interventions with high-risk groups and much-needed information campaigns at the community level.    Regarding TB control, WHO and the World Bank (WB) have taken the lead. However, after initial promising results, TB mortality increased from 18.4 per 100,000 in 1998 to 21.3 in 1999. From discussions with donors and the GOKG, as well as results of USAID-supported laboratory monitoring visits, USAID has agreed to significantly increase support for the TB Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) program.    In FY 2001, USAID intends to obligate, for technical assistance and training activities, the following amounts per category: Infectious Disease Prevention, $1,800,000 and Maternal/Child Health, $500,000.    In FY 2002, USAID will continue to deepen, broaden, and fully implement health care reforms.  USAID will also continue to support efforts to better diagnose, treat and prevent infectious diseases such as TB and HIV/AIDS.     Beneficiaries :  The primary beneficiaries are health professionals working in primary health care and infectious disease. The ultimate beneficiaries are users of these health services, who are predominantly women and children.    Possible Adjustments to Plans : Due to a high level of indebtedness, the World Bank Health II loan start date is uncertain and could lead to delays in key procurements, infrastructure development and technical assistance. USAID planned expansion of improved PHC to South Kyrgyzstan could be affected. Political will and support for change could be eroded, particularly in the area of restructuring of the Sanitary and Epidemiologic Services and in rationalizing the tertiary facilities in the capital city, Bishkek.    Other Donor Programs : The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have large health sector loans, specifically in health sector reform. WHO and Germany are active on TB control and Integrated Management of Childhood Illness programs. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) supports the GOKG in vaccine procurement. United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) procures contraceptives for the public sector.    Principal Contractors, Grantees, or Agencies : Implementing partners include Abt Associates/ZdravPlus, American International Health Alliance (AIHA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Counterpart Consortium, and Project Hope.

GX266-74-8259281	"REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY  IOWA CHILD DEATH REVIEW TEAM December 2002  Administrative Support Provided by: IOWA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH  Thomas J. Vilsack, Governor  Sally J. Pederson, Lt. Governor   Foreword Lon Walker, Chairperson  It may appear promising that Iowa child deaths were down from 472 in 2000 to 432 in 2001. Unfortunately, teen suicides increased from 18 to 23 during that time period and included one nine year old. In addition, Iowa continued to lose children to preventable traffic crashes, other accidents and homicides. The number of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths remained fairly steady at 37 in 2001, as compared to 38 the previous year. However, we should be able to lower the number of SIDS deaths through enhanced education for new families that centers on three risk factors identified in the majority of the SIDS deaths we reviewed: improper sleep environment, prenatal smoke exposure and secondhand smoke exposure. The team, formed by the Legislature in 1995, has now created a database with extensive information on several thousand deaths. Decisions based on that information would make a difference in reducing deaths of Iowa's children. It is also important to fund the Iowa Child Death Review Team to ensure its ability to continue advising on the protection and enhanced safety of Iowa's most important resource, our children. Based on solid data and extensive reviews, the Iowa Child Death Review Team has identified several ways many child deaths could be prevented. We have made recommendations in our 7 previous reports and again in this report that, if implemented, would help reduce child deaths. We are hopeful that we will see action taken this year to make Iowa a safer place for our children to live. If we truly are serious about making a difference, now is the time to act!  1   Executive Summary The Iowa Child Death Review Team (CDRT) was created by legislation passed in 1995. The team's first meeting took place in December of that year. Six of the original members and four of the original state agency liaisons still serve on the CDRT. As required by law, the team has published an annual report each year that summarizes its findings based on the previous year's case reviews. Since cases are reviewed retrospectively to assure all investigative and medical materials are complete and available, this year's report is based on child deaths (birth  17 years) occurring in calendar year 2001. During 2001, 432 child deaths occurred among Iowa's child residents dying in or out of state and child residents of other states or countries dying in Iowa. All of the homicide, accident and suicide deaths, as well as many of the undetermined and natural manner deaths could have been prevented through better public education, different attitudes and actions by care providers and/or improved intervention by an outside entity. The recommendations made by the CDRT can not assure the total safety of every child who lives within the state's boundaries or who visits Iowa, but they could potentially improve the chances that all of these children would live to adulthood. For Iowa's children to be assured a longer and safer life, the legislature, state and other public agencies and all care providers of children would need to take action on the team's recommendations. Such action has been slow to occur. The team continues to promote the recommendations and urge passage of legislation that would offer children a more secure future. In addition, the CDRT advises that entities involved in parenting and child-care provider education adopt the education-related suggestions and actively incorporate them into their education initiatives. Natural deaths continued to be the leading cause of child deaths in 2001. The vast majority of these deaths occurred during the first month of life. Most of the natural deaths resulted from premature birth or birth defects. Better and earlier prenatal care and smoking cessation would improve the chances that infants would not be born prematurely. Birth defects would be decreased as well if pregnant women and those around them did not smoke. Iowa is improving in the fight against these deaths. In 2000, there were 286 natural manner deaths. Of these deaths, prematurity caused 111 and congenital defects caused 91. In 2001, prematurity caused 92, and congenital defects caused 116 of the 262 natural deaths. Accidents are the leading cause of death for older children. In 2001, 84 children died from accidents as compared to 102 in 2000. Interestingly, in 2001 there were two more motor vehicle accident deaths than in the previous year despite the decrease in accidental deaths overall. The number of teen motor vehicle accidents is alarming. Lack of driving experience, poor judgement, alcohol/drug use and distractions due to friends in the vehicle all contributed significantly to the 61 motor vehicle accidents where teens were driving. In addition, several children, who were born in other countries and later immigrated to Iowa, died in motor vehicle crashes. In every one of these accidents, the driver of the vehicle (teen or parent) either was inexperienced with the harsh weather conditions or unfamiliar with Iowa's seatbelt and child safety restraint laws. These findings present a good case for graduated driver's licenses based on a young driver's age and other factors. Expanding driving privileges as a driver becomes more experienced with inclement weather driving and night driving is advisable to prevent future accidents of the types seen for 2001 road fatalities.  2   Homicide deaths decreased from 20 to 14 deaths between 2000 and 2001. In addition, 5 of the 14 deaths were caused by the same perpetrator who killed a mother and all of her children. As too often is seen, the perpetrator had been the mother's paramour. Undetermined manner deaths are deaths caused by something that cannot be pinpointed from a thorough autopsy, death scene investigation or other means. The majority of these deaths are attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Despite a decrease in child deaths overall, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths diminished by only one death from 2000 to 2001. Iowa's SIDS deaths still exceed that of most other states. Improved compliance by child-care givers (parents, grandparents, child-care providers) regarding proper safe sleep-practices and smoke free environments would greatly reduce the chances that so many of Iowa's children would die from SIDS. Suicides among children 17 and younger increased Even more tragic is the fact that the youngest child Improved gun safety in the home, including locked ammunition, could greatly reduce the number of su deaths were caused by firearms. by 28% from 2000 (18 cases) to 2001 (23 cases). to commit suicide was only nine years of age. gun cabinets and separately locked up icides by children since 12 of the 23 (52.2%)  Team Recommendations For Elected Officials:  Increase the fine to $100 for driving with an improperly restrained child in a motor vehicle.  Expand required autopsies for children from the current birth through age two years to birth through six years.  Increase reimbursement to counties for SIDS autopsies.  Expand the Empowerment initiative to all areas of the state.  Expand appropriated funding for the Iowa Child Death Review Team to cover actual operating expenses ($40,000).  Require immediate drug screens of care providers present when a child dies in a suspected accident, homicide or undetermined manner. Require immediate drug screens of drivers when there is a fatal motor vehicle collision.  Increase the penalty for child endangerment resulting in the death of a child.  Require all in-ground and above ground swimming pools sold in Iowa to have swimming pool alarms installed by the purchaser or seller.  Require all child autopsies to be completed and reported to the State Medical Examiner's office within three months of the death.  Require nicotine metabolite testing to be included in the autopsy when an infant dies so that accurate exposure to tobacco can be determined and evaluated for its role in the death of the child. Many of these recommendations do not require additional money to implement. However, they all require action by elected officials to become policy.  A preventable death is one in which an individual or a community could have reasonably done something that would have changed the circumstances that led to the death. 3   2002 IOWA CHILD DEATH REVIEW TEAM REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR AND IOWA GENERAL ASSEMBLY In 1995, a new state law established the Iowa Child Death Review Team (CDRT). This law (Code of Iowa 135.43) describes the team membership and the specific responsibilities of the CDRT. Additional legislation was passed in 1998 that protects team representatives from liability while performing their duties to the team and protects entities that supply information to the CDRT for review. The Child Death Review Team is composed of 14 members and 7 state government liaisons. Each member represents a different profession or medical specialty, but all of the organizations represented have a documented commitment to helping children survive and thrive. There is a member representing each of the following: perinatology, pediatrics, law enforcement, social work, mental health, substance abuse, domestic violence, family practice, state medical examiner, county attorneys, SIDS, insurance industry, emergency room nurse and a member-at-large. Liaisons from the following state agencies also participate in review of child death cases: human services, public health, transportation, attorney general's office, education, vital records and public safety. These representatives are selected by their agency director with consideration of their expertise in child behavior, injury and death and their commitment to team attendance and interdepartmental cooperation. The Iowa Department of Public Health provides coordination and administrative support for the Child Death Review Team. The teams' responsibilities include:  Collection, review and analyses of child death certificates, data and records concerning the deaths of children ages birth through 17 years, and preparation of an annual report summarizing the team's findings.         Formulation of recommendations to the governor and general assembly about interventions that could prevent future child deaths. Formulation of recommendations to state agencies represented on the CDRT as to how they may improve services to children to prevent future child deaths. Maintenance of confidentiality of all records that the team reviews. Development of protocols and a child abuse-related death committee.  The law also specifies the length of team appointment and attendance requirements for the CDRT members. The rules governing the team's operation may be found in the Iowa Administrative Code 641-90(135). It should be noted that the 1995 legislation mandated reviews of child deaths through age 6 years. In 2000, that age was expanded to include child deaths through age 17 years. Since 1995, the Child Death Review Team has reviewed more than 2400 cases of child death. This document is the seventh CDRT annual report regarding child death in the state of Iowa and ways that future child deaths might be reduced or prevented.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PREVENTION OF FUTURE DEATHS The Child Death Review Team has reviewed cases of child deaths for seven years. The recommendations made in this report are intended to help prevent future deaths. These recommendations are not case-specific, but are intended to deal with a broad range of issues. After a list of the specific recommendations, there is a brief discussion as to why each recommendation was made. Special attention should be given to any recommendation that has been made in previous annual reports and is stated again this year.  4   RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE IOWA GENERAL ASSEMBLY RECOMMENDATIONS REQUIRING LEGISLATIVE ACTION: Recommendation 1: The CDRT recommends continued expansion of the Community Empowerment initiative. The CDRT especially advocates implementation of Community Empowerment programs that devote approximately 60% of their funds to home visits for all families with a newborn child so that each family may become educated in appropriate health and care practices relating to infants and young children. Recommendation 2: The CDRT recommends raising the fine to $100 for driving with an improperly restrained child under six years of age in a motor vehicle. Recommendation 3: The CDRT recommends that the performance of an autopsy including toxicology studies be required for every death of a child through age 6 with the exception of children who are known to have died of a disease process while attended by a physician. In addition, the team recommends full body x-rays of any child who dies before their second birthday. Recommendation 4: The CDRT recommends reimbursement for actual expenses incurred for the performance of an autopsy, x-rays and toxicology tests on an infant dying from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to any county in which a SIDS death occurs. The current law allots $400 per case. The limit for this reimbursement should be $1700. In addition, the CDRT recommends payment of up to a $600 reimbursement for transportation of the body to the autopsy site. 5  Recommendation 5: Immediate drug screens should be done on caretakers and people having access to a child just prior to the death. All drivers involved in a fatal motor vehicle accident should be tested for alcohol and drugs at the time of the crash. Recommendation 6: Funding appropriated for continued operation of the Iowa Child Death Review Team should be raised from $15,000 to $40, 000, so that the actual expenses incurred in operation of team activities may be covered in full. Recommendation 7: The penalty for child endangerment that results in the death of a child should be increased. Section 726.6 of the Iowa Code should be amended to add a NEW subsection 726.6(2), as follows: ""A person who commits child endangerment resulting in the death of a child or minor is guilty of a class ""B"" felony."" Section 902.12 of the Iowa Code should be amended to add a NEW subsection 902.12(5), as follows: ""Child endangerment resulting in serious injury and child endangerment resulting in death in violation of section 726.6(2) or 726.6(3)."" Recommendation 8: The CDRT recommends that all in-ground and above ground swimming pools sold in Iowa be required by law to have a pool alarm installed by the seller or the purchaser. OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendation 9: The CDRT recommends the performance of cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) testing on all infants who die in Iowa to accurately determine the potential role of tobacco exposure as a risk factor in their deaths. It is suggested that funding for this testing should come from state taxes on tobacco products.   Recommendation 10: The CDRT recommends establishment of a statewide system of local or regional child death review teams to review deaths of all children through age 17 occurring in their area. They would share their information with the state team. These teams should be permitted the same statutory authority given to the state CDRT to gather and review information related to child deaths as long as they operate under strict confidentiality guidelines. Team members would be volunteers, so the cost of operating local teams would be minimal. Recommendation 11: The CDRT recommends that every child death that is a medical examiner's case be reported on a Medical Examiner I report form to the State Medical Examiner's office within four weeks of its occurrence. The final autopsy and toxicology results should be submitted within three months of the child's death unless special laboratory tests delay this process. It is recommended that all results be submitted within six months of the child's death.  Therefore, programs such as the Empowerment initiative are of tremendous value in educating new parents and preparing them to provide appropriate and adequate care for their children. Recommendation 2: All too frequently children are not properly restrained in a moving automobile, SUV or truck. In a motor vehicle collision, an unrestrained or inadequately restrained child can be ejected from the vehicle or thrown around in the vehicle. Fatal head injuries and internal injuries often result in these instances. Therefore, anything that may help deter drivers from failing to follow the law that requires children under age 6 to be restrained in a moving vehicle, should be done. A significant fine of $100 would help to obtain compliance. Recommendation 3: An immediate autopsy of a young child who dies helps to accurately pinpoint the precise cause and manner of death. Accurately classifying manner and cause assures that any wrongdoing may be adequately and quickly investigated. It also helps to determine preventable factors that led to the death. Recommendation 4: The state currently reimburses counties $400 for any autopsy done on an infant who dies from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The actual costs for this type of an autopsy exceeds $1500 when required x-rays and toxicology tests are included. This poor reimbursement places a burden on any county where a SIDS infant dies. In addition, no reimbursement is made for transporting the body to another city or county where a deputy state medical examiner has agreed to perform the autopsy. Increased reimbursement would ease the burden of counties adhering to guidelines for autopsies on infants. It would also encourage transporting bodies to the state medical examiner for autopsy rather than sending them out-of-state to a closer facility.  DISCUSSION OF RECOMMENDATIONS: The following text offers background that supports and explains each recommendation. Recommendation 1: The majority of child deaths resulting from accidents and many resulting from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) could be prevented. Lack of adequate knowledge about child rearing and health, sometimes coupled with lack of parental supervision, plays a huge role in these types of deaths. For example, parents may be unaware of the dangers of even a small amount of bathtub water and the danger it poses to a toddler. Rural families often do not think about the dangers offered by farm ponds, large machinery or building materials. Many parents are unaware that prone sleep position or smoking during pregnancy or afterward contributes to SIDS.  6   Recommendation 5: Alcohol and drugs may play a large part in child neglect, inappropriate child-care, child abuse or in motor vehicle mishaps. It is impossible to assess the involvement of chemical substances in the death of a child if testing for these substances is not done immediately at the death scene on all care providers present when the child dies. Deaths may be inaccurately classified as to cause; perpetrators may go unidentified or unpunished; the extent of the involvement of chemical substances in child deaths may be under-reported and so not addressed by public health programs or legislative action. A law requiring this testing would assure that law enforcement in all parts of the state adhere to this recommendation. Recommendation 6: In 1995 when the Child Death Review Team was established by the legislature and governor, an appropriation of $20,000 was set aside for the team's operation. This funding was to cover team members' travel, report requests, copying of records, development and printing of an annual report, staff support and any other related expenses necessary for the optimal functioning of the CDRT. In 1998, the legislature and governor established the Domestic Violence Death Review Team. The CDRT had the same tasks as when it was originally founded, but $5,000 of the original $20,000 appropriation was set aside for the new Domestic Violence Death Review Team! In 2000, the purview of the CDRT expanded from children birth through age 6 to birth through age 17. The appropriation still remained at $15,000. This funding does not cover much more than team travel, the annual report development, case ordering and some printing. Funding for staff salary, office expenses, team training, etc. is not adequate. Although the FY 2002 budget recommendation originally included a significant increase in the appropriation for the CDRT, it was not funded at that level. Currently, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) is providing additional funds 7  to continue the very basic operation of the CDRT. IDPH obviously understands and appreciates the value of the team. However, it is unrealistic and unfair to expect IDPH to eke out additional funds from its already meager budget to fund an interdisciplinary team that was established by law. Since the 14 professionals on the team donate an average of 12 hours per month to the perform the work of the CDRT, it appears that funding the team at $40,000 per year through an adequate budget appropriation is a small investment for saving the lives of Iowa's children. Recommendation 7: When children die from non-accidental, intentionally inflicted injuries, a perpetrator may presently be charged with either child endangerment resulting in serious injury, a class ""C"" felony punishable by 10 years in prison, or with murder in the first degree, a class ""A"" felony punishable by life in prison without parole. In instances where the available evidence does not support a first degree murder charge (""extreme indifference to human life""), the child endangerment resulting in serious injury is seen an insufficiently serious charge for those acts of child endangerment that result in a child's death. Recommendation 8: The CDRT has reviewed numerous deaths of children who drowned in residential swimming pools. All of these deaths were preventable, had someone known that a child had entered the water. Despite Consumer Product Safety Commission recommendations to the public about putting a fence with a locked gate around any home pool, owners continue to leave pools open and accessible to curious children. A new pool alarm has been developed that can be installed at the water line, inside of the pool. If anyone goes into the pool when the alarm is set, a warning signal sounds to alert the owner and others residing in the area that someone has entered the water. The cost of this type of alarm is approximately $250, a cost that is negligible compared to the cost of a pool.   Recommendation 9: Medical research long ago identified the role of secondhand tobacco exposure in the deaths of infants, primarily from prematurity and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Smoking during pregnancy has been shown to be a major risk factor for both premature birth and SIDS. When prone sleeping position is removed as a risk factor for SIDS, smoking emerges as the next most significant risk. Although birth certificates have a place to record the use of tobacco by the mother during pregnancy, this information may not be recorded or may be inaccurate due to the mother's unwillingness to admit to a behavior that could be harmful to her unborn child. Exposure of an infant to secondhand smoke either at home or at a child care provider's residence may be noted on an Infant Death Scene Investigation, if one is done, but this information has usually been sketchy. We truly do not have an accurate idea of how many infant deaths in Iowa may be related to smoking. The number is probably much greater than birth certificates and death scene investigations indicate. If cotinine testing were done on all infants who die in Iowa, a true grasp of the extent of tobacco exposure in-utero and after birth could be assessed. Then, the need for better smoking-related interventions would be documented in Iowa's population. Recommendation 10: The CDRT conducts retrospective reviews of child deaths so that all records related to the child, such as autopsies and law enforcement investigations, are complete prior to the reviews. The drawback to this method is that if some part of the death investigation was not adequately completed or if questionable information exists on reports, it is most likely too late to obtain that information. In addition, with a retrospective review system, follow-up checks on the safety of surviving siblings, the involvement of vital community agencies in the investigation or public education endeavors are delayed. 8  Several states, notably North Carolina, Colorado and Missouri have developed statewide systems of county multidisciplinary child death review teams. These teams meet immediately following the death of a child to pool their information, determine what else needs to be done, conduct public education activities for prevention of future child deaths and send reports of their reviews to the state child death review team. Communication and sharing of records expedites the review process at all levels and helps assure complete and thorough review of each death by two competent panels of reviewers, one at the local level and one at the state level. Only five Iowa counties (Polk, Woodbury, Dubuque, Pottawattamie and Scott) currently have local review teams. Most of these teams review only infant deaths or child abuse-related deaths. With the expansion of the state's CDRT to include children through age 17 years, it would be helpful to have all local teams include children of the same ages. As with the state team, these 5 local teams try to use what is learned in reviews to prevent future deaths. Establishing a statewide system of local or regional teams would assure earlier, more thorough and targeted interventions on a community level when any child dies. Recommendation 11: Although efficient reporting of out-of-hospital deaths and other medical examiner cases is requested from county medical examiners, current reporting can take months or longer to be reported on an M.E. I form to the State Medical Examiner's office. This delay in reporting causes inaccurate statistical reporting to other agencies and delays the collection of autopsies and other reports for CDRT review. Requiring more efficient completion of reports to the state medical examiner's office would assist the team in its operation and assure complete reporting of all deaths to that office.   RECOMMENDATIONS TO STATE AGENCIES Recommendation 1: to the Iowa Department of Human Services, Field Office Support Unit. When a child dies due to a parent's or a caretaker's ignorance, neglect or aggression, the CDRT recommends that ongoing efforts be made to visit the surviving children in the home within one month to assess the safety and well-being of these children and enable voluntary referrals to appropriate services. This visit is to be completed by DHS caseworkers knowledgeable in family dynamics and child abuse and/or neglect. (It is recognized that the Iowa Department of Human Services has made much progress in addressing this issue. The assessment approach is now being used statewide to respond to reports of child abuse. This approach mandates evaluating the alleged abuse, taking needed actions to safeguard the child and engaging the family in services to enhance family strengths and address identified needs. This approach facilitates the provision of needed services to children and families. In addition, it is recognized that DHS staff cannot investigate situations of which they are not notified. Delayed autopsy results and delayed caretaker drug testing results, along with inconclusive or nonexistent law enforcement investigations, hamper the ability of DHS to intervene with surviving children when abuse may have been involved in the death of a sibling. ) Recommendation 2: to the Commission of Uniform State Laws. The CDRT recommends that the Commission on Uniform State Laws propose legislation in Iowa and promote the passage of legislation in other states which would facilitate the exchange of medical, investigative or other information pertaining to a child death. This legislation should include the following language: "" A person in possession or control of medical, investigative or other information pertaining to a child death and child abuse review shall allow the  reproduction of the information by the Child Death Review Team of another state operating substantially in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, to be used only in the administration and for the duties of that Child Death Review Team and provided that state grants reciprocal exchange of such child death information to Iowa's Child Death Review Team. Information and records that are otherwise confidential remain confidential under this section. A person does not incur legal liability by reason of releasing information to a Child Death Review Team as required under this section."" A meeting between Iowa's CDRT and representatives from other Child Death Review Teams was held in Des Moines in April 2000. One of the main objectives of that conference was to discuss better sharing of information among states. All state team representatives agreed that they also have problems collecting information from other states, and they would support an interstate agreement that would expedite and ease the process. Recommendation 3: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The CDRT recommends that all foster care parents be required to learn and be certified in child and infant CPR and that they be required to be re-certified in this procedure annually. In addition, foster parents should be required to have extensive education regarding appropriate sleep practices and environment for infants. Their homes should be assessed for secondhand smoke exposure and safety before they are accepted into the foster care program. Recommendation 4: to the Department of Public Safety. The CDRT recommends follow up by law enforcement officers of all cases involving potentially life-threatening injuries resulting from any accident for all children of any age. In the event that an injured child dies either in-state or out-ofstate from an injury that occurred in their jurisdiction, a thorough investigation of the circumstances surrounding the accident should be conducted by law enforcement. 9   Recommendation 5: to the Iowa Department of Public Health. The CDRT recommends enhanced statewide education of parents and other care providers and health care professionals who regularly come in contact with new parents. This education should focus on all risk factors related to an infant's sleep environment and on issues related to tobacco exposure before and after birth. Recommendation 6: to all state agencies and their local units or contractors who conduct activities in the homes of their clients/ customers. The CDRT recommends that the state agencies require each local unit or contractor, whenever conducting activities in the homes of their clients or customers, to check for the presence and operating status of smoke alarms. They should also evaluate the presence of other safety hazards and recommend to residents when repairs, changes or replacements are needed. Recommendation 7: to the Iowa Department of Public Safety and the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. The CDRT recommends that all law enforcement agencies follow the Child Death Scene Investigation Protocol and that the report forms be filled out and submitted as quickly as possible to the proper entity. It is further recommended that the curriculum of the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy include instruction on this protocol and report form. Recommendation 8: to the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy. The Child Death Review Team recommends that the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy curriculum emphasize the importance of death scene photographs and sketches along with use of the Death Scene Investigation Protocol and Form. Recommendation 9: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The Child Death Review Team recommends long term close monitoring of children after they have been returned to their parental home or after a parent who has been  incarcerated returns to the home. Special attention should be given to substance abuse by the parent(s) and unsafe surroundings in the child's home. Multidisciplinary team staffings and contacts with the parent's probation officer are suggested for these types of cases. Recommendation 10: to the Iowa Department of Human Services. The Child Death Review Team recommends removal of very young children (less than 4 years old) from unsafe family situations while the parents work to improve the home environment. Close follow up with the family to monitor its progress should be made for one year after the child is back in the home, and frequent and thorough visits to the home should be made. In addition, any caseworker entering a home for any reason should perform a home safety check. The results should be reviewed with the parents, and the safety check should be repeated at a later date to evaluate improvements. Recommendation 11: to the Iowa Department of Public Health. The Child Death Review Team recommends increased education for parents on the hazards of delayed medical care, secondhand smoke exposure, inappropriate dosing of medications and drug interactions. It further recommends enlisting the cooperation of hospitals to include this education for new parents both verbally and through printed information in their discharge-packets.  10   Child Death Review Team Accomplishments During the 2002 calendar year, the members of the Child Death Review Team took a very serious and proactive approach to help save Iowa's children from early deaths. These accomplishments focused primarily on education, meetings and awareness building activities around the state. Specifically, in addition to reviewing 432 cases of child death, the members of the CDRT:  Met with members of the Iowa Legislature to discuss ways to implement some of the recommendations detailed in the 2001 CDRT Annual Report to the Governor and General Assembly. Advanced awareness among health professionals and the public by giving presentations about child abuse. Participated as members of local child death review teams in their county of residence. Worked with the state medical examiner to widely disseminate the newly revised Child Death Scene Investigation Form to law enforcement personnel and county medical examiners. Worked with the Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa SIDS Alliance on their regional SIDS conferences for professionals that were held in several sites across Iowa. Several CDRT members were presenters at those conferences. Worked with the Polk County African American community to explore and address the high rate of black infant mortality in Iowa. Worked with DCI to assure a suspected homicide, that was not investigated by local law enforcement, was investigated and acted upon. Revised the Child Death Review Team data collection form to include variables related to deaths of older children and worked with Information Management at IDPH to develop a statistical reporting system.            11   Iowa Year 2001 Deaths of Children Ages Birth through 17 Years By County of Residence County Adair Adams Allamakee Appanoose Audubon Benton Black Hawk Boone Bremer Buchanan Buena Vista Butler Calhoun Carroll Cass Cedar Cerro Gordo Cherokee Chickasaw Clarke Clay Clayton Clinton Crawford Dallas Davis Decatur Delaware Des Moines Dickinson Dubuque Emmet Fayette Number 0 0 3 1 0 1 20 3 2 1 1 1 2 3 5 4 8 3 2 1 1 4 8 2 8 2 2 5 4 3 11 0 1 County Floyd Franklin Fremont Greene Grundy Guthrie Hamilton Hancock Hardin Harrison Henry Howard Humboldt Ida Iowa Jackson Jasper Jefferson Johnson Jones Keokuk Kossuth Lee Linn Louisa Lucas Lyon Madison Mahaska Marion Marshall Mills Mitchell Number 2 0 1 2 3 2 3 0 1 1 1 2 2 1 0 1 5 1 13 4 5 2 2 29 0 0 4 5 1 2 13 2 1 County Numbe Monona Monroe Montgomery Muscatine O'Brien Osceola Page Palo Alto Plymouth Pocahontas Polk Pottawattamie Poweshiek Ringgold Sac Scott Shelby Sioux Story Tama Taylor Union VanBuren Wapello Warren Washington Wayne Webster Winnebago Winneshiek Woodbury Worth Wright r 1 0 3 3 1 1 4 0 4 1 62 6 0 0 3 26 3 2 9 4 1 5 1 2 7 3 3 0 1 1 30 3 1  Number of Out of State Children Ages Birth through 17 Years Dying in Iowa in 2001 State Nebraska Wisconsin Texas Number 10 1 1 State Missouri Illinois Mexico Number 1 4 1  12   Ages of Children at Death Of the 432 children who died in 2001, the youngest was minutes old, and the oldest child was nearly 18. The three age classifications used in this report are birth through 28 days (neonatal), 29 days through 364 days (post-neonatal) and 1 through 17 years (child).

The race/ethnicity attributed to the child is that listed on the birth certificate for the mother. The majority of deaths occurred among whites, followed by Hispanics. Because Iowa's population is primarily Caucasian, these results are to be expected. However, prevention messages and intervention programs must be careful to target all cultural and ethnic groups across the state in the manner most accessible and useful to each group.

Five manners of death relate to deaths of children:  Natural means the death was the result of some natural process, such as disease, prematurity/immaturity or congenital defect. Most deaths by this manner are considered by the CDRT to be nonpreventable. However, many deaths from prematurity or congenital defects might be prevented through better counseling during preconception and pregnancy, earlier or more consistent prenatal care and smoking cessation. Accidental means the death resulted from some unintentional act. This manner of death is the most effectively reducible through education of all care providers of children to provide a safe environment with adequate supervision. Homicide means the death was caused by a criminal act. The act committed by the perpetrator may not have been intended to cause the child's death. Undetermined means that investigation of the circumstances and examination through autopsy did not clearly identify the way in which the death occurred. In this category, we include deaths attributed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, since this cause is determined by the absence of other signs rather than by a clearly identified finding. Suicide means that evidence exits that the child intentionally caused his or her own death.  Prior to 2001, the team only dealt with deaths from natural, accidental, undetermined and homicide manners. In addition to these five manners of death, when the manner and cause have not yet been determined and the investigation is still incomplete, ""pending"" is recorded as the manner of death. When the final determination has been made, the medical examiner amends the death certificate to accurately indicate the manner and cause of death. For 2001, there were no children for whom an amended death certificate was not submitted to Iowa's Department of Vital Records because of diligent efforts by their staff to obtain the updated information.    Manner of Death For All Child Deaths 2001 Manner Natural Accident Homicide Suicide Undetermined Total Number 262 84 14 23 49 432 % of Deaths 60.7 19.5 3.2 5.3 11.3 100%        15   Causes of Death Death certificates identify the immediate cause of death and, where it can be determined, one or more conditions leading to the immediate cause (i.e., the immediate cause of death was due to or a consequence of some other disease or condition). Because the immediate cause in most instances is cardiac and/or respiratory arrest, we have followed the usual death analysis procedure of using the underlying cause (the disease or injury that initiated events resulting in the death) for our data and analyses. When the team reclassified the manner or cause of death, analyses are based upon manner and cause of death as determined by the CDRT through case reviews. Note: Case determinations were based on evaluations of all materials available at the time the reviews were conducted. Natural The majority of the 262 deaths in this group were due to five causes: prematurity; congenital defects that were incompatible with life or following treatment to correct the defect; birth complications; infections; and, forms of cancer. As demonstrated in the following table, the predominant two causes of natural deaths were prematurity and congenital defects. The 262 natural deaths comprised 60.7 percent of all 2001 child deaths. Deaths from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although coded as natural on death certificates, are considered separately in this report as part of the undetermined category.

Accidents comprised 19.5 percent of all child deaths occurring that year. The major cause was motor vehicle collisions (72.5% of accidental deaths). Accidental trauma is considered preventable, but to prevent it requires the efforts of many  16   people including the victim, the family and the community. Education of the community, parents and care providers can help prevent accidental deaths among children of all ages. The CDRT believes that better adult supervision could have prevented many of these deaths. Parents and other caregivers need to know where young children are at all times. Adults should remove all dangerous objects from the child's environment and make children use protective gear when they are taking part in potentially dangerous activities. Adults who care for young children should adhere to safe bedding guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. They should watch for drug and alcohol use among teens that drive and stress bike, motorcycle and automobile safety, including proper use of seat belts and child restraint systems. All parents and other caregivers should make sure fire alarms are in operational order at all times. Fences with locked gates and pool alarms should be used to protect children from wandering into yards with unattended swimming pools. Firearms should be locked away from children and ammunition kept in separate, locked areas. Children under 12 should not be allowed to operate any motor vehicle including snowmobiles, all terrain vehicles or go-carts. There were no accidents among neonates. For post-neonatal deaths, there were three deaths due to accidents: one house-fire, one motor vehicle accident and one case of hyperthermia. All other accidents involved children one year or older.

The perpetrator's relationship to the victim varied. In one case, the father was the perpetrator. The mother was responsible in three deaths. The mother's paramour was guilty in eight cases. A friend killed one teen male, and for one death the perpetrator was never identified. Homicides are another area where prevention is possible. When a young child is the victim, this type of death often indicates anger and frustration on the part of the caregiver. Parents and caregivers need easily accessible outlets, i.e. respite care or someone to call, when stresses of child-care escalate. Improved dissemination of information to all new parents about 17   resources could assist in preventing future child homicide deaths. Home visits soon after an infant's birth to families that are at high risk for abusing children is needed in every community. Early intervention could save lives. Older children must not have easy access to firearms. All children should be closely supervised to make sure their social contacts are appropriate and interactions take place under safe circumstances. Parents should monitor teens for alcohol and drug use. Parents must be conscientious and discriminating about the adults they bring into close and unsupervised contact with their children no matter what the role of the outsider in the household. Communities must work together to stem the use of drugs and alcohol and eliminate the existence of domestic violence and gang activities.

Undetermined Undetermined manner of deaths includes any death that cannot be classified as natural, accident, suicide or homicide. Most of the deaths included in this manner are ruled Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). It is specified as the cause of death when all other causes have been eliminated based on a thorough autopsy, death scene investigation and clinical history. Although SIDS deaths are recorded on the death certificate as natural, the CDRT considers all SIDS deaths to be undetermined manner of death based on the technical definition of SIDS. The team determined that there were 49 child deaths for which autopsies failed to pinpoint a specific cause of death. The cause of death in the majority (37) of these deaths was found to be SIDS. The remaining 12 deaths were due to a variety of other causes, none of which could be clearly identified.  2 1 6 1 3 1 14  14.3 7.1 42.9 7.1 21.4 7.1 100%  18   Causes of Undetermined Deaths All Children through 17 Years of Age Cause SIDS Undetermined Total Number 37 12 49 % of Undetermined 75.5 24.5 100% % of All deaths 8.6 2.7 11.3  SIDS Deaths by Month Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Total Number of Deaths 6 4 4 1 3 1 3 1 6 4 2 2 37  SIDS Deaths Most SIDS deaths occur in infants 2 to 4 months of age.

Bed sharing is becoming an enormous risk. In 2001, 15 (40.5%) of the infants dying from SIDS were sleeping with at least one adult or with a sibling on an adult bed, sofa or adult bed mattress. Prenatal Smoking by Mother for Infants Who Died of SIDS Smoking Yes No Unknown Total Number 16 19 2 37 % of SIDS 43.2 51.4 5.4 100%  The majority of 2001 SIDS deaths occurred while a parent was caring for the infant, and most occurred during January, September and March. SIDS deaths usually occur during colder months.  19   Secondhand Smoke Exposure by Infants Who Died of SIDS Exposure Yes No Unknown Total Number 25 4 8 37 % of SIDS 67.6 10.8 21.6 100%  Nearly half of the mothers of SIDS babies smoked during pregnancy. Since smoking is self-reported on birth certificates, it is likely that the actual number is much greater. Alarmingly, 67.6% of SIDS infants were routinely exposed to second hand smoke from at least one source after birth. Bedding at Time of Death for Infants Who Died of SIDS Bedding Inappropriate Appropriate Unknown Total Number 16 14 7 37 % of SIDS 43.3 37.8 18.9 100%  Clearly, most of the infants dying in 2001 from SIDS were exposed to risks in their sleep environment. More than 43% were exposed to unsafe bedding, and 51.4% were found in a prone position. Another 10.8% were found on their side. Literature indicates that prone position carries nine times the risk of back position, while side carries two times the risk of back sleeping. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in bed-sharing which puts infants at risk, not just from possible overlaying by a parent or sibling, but from heavy, porous bed covers and pillows on an adult sleep surface and from overheating when exposed to adult body heat. Breast-feeding is very beneficial for infants and is strongly advocated by the CDRT. However, many breast-feeding experts promote bed sharing to ease access for the infant. The hazards of the adult bed should preclude such advice as the statistics suggest. In 2001, 40.5% of babies succumbing to SIDS were sharing a sleep surface with an adult or older sibling.

In 2001, the total number of births in Iowa was 37,610. Iowa's SIDS occurrence rates for the past nine years are as follows:          1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001         1.43 deaths per 1000 live births 1.37 deaths per 1000 live births 1.22 deaths per 1000 live births .73 deaths per 1000 live births .82 deaths per 1000 live births .86 deaths per 1000 live births 1.28 deaths per 1000 live births .99 deaths per 1000 live births .98 deaths per 1000 live births  The Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa SIDS Alliance offered many educational seminars on SIDS to Iowans during 2002. New SIDS brochures that note the risks of bed-sharing and a new SIDS educational video were developed and sent to all pediatric and family practice clinics throughout Iowa, as well as to all hospitals with OB departments. In addition, updated SIDS educational brochures for child-care providers were developed. Educating the teachers of parents, grandparents, child-care providers and others who come in contact with infants is the key to reducing risks for Iowa's babies and saving lives from SIDS. Suicide Suicide is a manner of death not previously reviewed by the members of the Iowa Child Death Review Team. As the team expanded its purview to include children ages 7 through 17 years of age, suicide deaths became a primary area where lives could potentially be saved. To improve the team's knowledge about suicide, a child psychiatrist was added to the team when the original mental health representative resigned. In 2001, suicides comprised 5.3% of all child deaths. In any given year, more males than females successfully commit suicide. Males are more likely to use a violent means of death. The victim may be involved with drugs or alcohol abuse, may have unhealthy social contacts, family problems, be physically or sexually abused or have a history of mental health problems. Unfortunately, 23 youth died from suicide in the year 2001. This number is a 28% increase over child suicide deaths in 2000. Of the 23 suicides of children, 21 were males. The youngest victim was only nine years old, and the oldest child was nearly 18. Several victims had a history of family or school problems, and some had used  For comparison, based on preliminary data for 2000 the national SIDS mortality rate was .529 per 1000 live births. When Iowa's SIDS deaths increased by 50% (from 32 to 48) from 1998 to 1999, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH), the Iowa Child Death Review Team, and the Iowa SIDS Alliance joined forces to take aggressive measures to halt the increase. In January 2001, IDPH and the Iowa SIDS Alliance sent a letter to all hospital administrators in the state. The 1999 SIDS statistics and SIDS educational materials were enclosed. Hospitals were asked to help stem the rise in SIDS deaths by modeling appropriate sleep position of healthy infants in their newborn nurseries. Most of the hospitals re-evaluated and revised their policies for sleep position. As the health ""experts"" that come most closely into contact with the mother for a prolonged period of time directly following a baby's birth, their example is most likely to be mimicked at home. Unfortunately, some Iowa hospitals still resist back sleeping in the nursery for healthy newborns, usually because the staff adheres to old beliefs that infants placed on their backs soon after birth will choke if they spit up. This has not shown to be the case, but changing attitudes is a slow process.  21   drugs and/or alcohol. Most of the deaths occurred in rural counties. Self-inflicted gunshot wounds were the primary method used by males, followed by hanging. The two females used hanging to end their young lives.

Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Deaths of Natural Manner 1. Both prospective parents (father and mother) should be physically mature and healthy, both prior to conception of the child and throughout the pregnancy. Damaging substances of any sort, including alcohol, tobacco, certain prescription medications and all street drugs must be avoided. 2. Prenatal care should begin as early as possible, and regular prenatal visits should be continued. Prenatal visits should include intensive smoking cessation counseling if the mother currently smokes. In addition, evaluation of secondhand smoke exposure of the mother should be conducted early on in the pregnancy, and the potential risks of such exposure should be carefully explained to her. 3. Prenatal visits should include patient-specific education and interventions aimed at modifiable risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol and drug use. 4. Genetic counseling, available through the University of Iowa regional clinics or private sources, should be recommended to and utilized by parents with potential genetic problems, especially to those who have given birth to children with genetic anomalies, to identify and make the parents aware of the possibilities of future problems. 5. All children should receive regular and timely wellness checkups at clinics or physicians' offices. Parents should be educated about signs and symptoms of illness in their children and indications for seeking medical attention. Families should be discouraged in using hospital emergency rooms as their only source of medical care, since preventive activities such as immunizations may be missed at the time of care. 6.New parents should be thoroughly instructed on the appropriateness and timeliness of well child checkups and proper administration medicines to young children. 7. Iowa's hard to reach populations, such as certain cultural and ethnic communities, should have culturally-targeted education on the necessity for quality and timely prenatal care, potential hazards of home births and preventive care and practices relating to young children. This education should be done in the language most used by each population. 8. Hospitals should evaluate the mental stability and intellectual capacity of mothers prior to discharge after a new baby is born. Referrals to social services, DHS or local Empowerment should be made if there are concerns about a mother's ability to parent.  23   Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Accidental Deaths  1. Children six and under should always be properly restrained when riding in motor vehicles of any type. Care should be taken that the child restraint device being used is of the correct type (i.e. infant-seat or booster-seat) and has been properly fitted to the child. The device should also be installed properly, and the child must be correctly positioned and fastened in the restraint system. 2. Children should ride in the rear seats of vehicles and child safety door locks should be used when available. Automobiles should be kept locked when not in use. 3. Individuals who have repeatedly demonstrated unsafe driving should not be permitted to continue driving. Stronger penalties for multiple offense drivers should be instituted. 4. Bicycle helmet use should be required by law, and the requirement should be strongly supported by parents, teachers and caregivers. 5. Parents and other drivers should check behind all motor vehicles, including farm equipment, before backing up any vehicle. 6. Parents, grandparents, foster parents, daycare providers and other caregivers should learn first aid, administration of CPR, and the Heimlich Maneuver to infants and children. 7. Parents and caregivers should recognize and give only ageappropriate foods to infants and children with special attention to solids given before the age of four. 8. Extreme vigilance should be practiced whenever children are in, around, or near water, including bathtubs, pools and larger bodies of water regardless of the water depth. Parents and caregivers need to be cautioned that bathtub rings are not safety devices and that children must never be left alone in the water, even momentarily. Children playing near lakes, ponds and rivers should use flotation devices as a precaution. In addition, children should be taught to swim as early as possible. 9. Home gates. To should be should be pools should be surrounded by fencing and have locked prevent unsupervised play by curious children, wading pools emptied immediately after each use. Likewise, fencing put around decorative ponds in residential areas.  10. Smoke alarms should be installed in every house, apartment and trailer home and checked frequently to assure their continuing operability. 11. Children less than twelve years of age should never operate an All Terrain Vehicle. Young children should not ride on All Terrain Vehicles. 24   12. A responsible person should supervise children at play, especially if potentially dangerous equipment or hazardous apparatus is in or near the play area. This supervision is especially important in areas where open septic tanks, manure pits or grain bins may be accessible to the children. 13. Firearms should be stored unloaded and in a locked receptacle, and ammunition should be stored in a separate, locked receptacle, with both keys unavailable to children. 14. Children should not ride on farm equipment unless it is in a closed cab that has securely fastened doors, and they are under the direct supervision of an adult. 15. Matches and lighters should be stored only in safe places that are unknown to young children. Parents should teach all children about the dangers of matches and lighters. 16. Children should be well supervised by a competent adult at all times. The adult should be capable of and attuned to evaluating potential dangers in the child's environment and continually monitoring their surroundings for possible hazards. 17. Infants and young children should sleep only in a safety-approved crib and alone. Cribs should not be purchased at garage sales or second-hand stores where they may not meet CPSC requirements. 1. Mothers should be cautioned about careful selection of individuals who care for their children, most especially paramours. Reports of criminal history can be obtained at reasonable charge from local police departments. 2. Inexperienced parents should be linked with a mentor to whom they can turn when they have questions or are stressed. 3. The frequency and content of public service announcements that illustrate the importance of parents or other caretakers taking a ""time out"" when the stress of child care becomes overwhelming should be improved. 4. Parents should be given a list of respite care resources/options and emergency numbers at the time of hospital discharge after the birth of every new infant. These resources should also be discussed at prenatal visits. 5. Parents of older children should carefully and consistently monitor the friends with whom they associate and enforce strict curfews.  Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future Homicide Deaths  25   Actions and Strategies that Could Prevent Future SIDS and Other Undetermined Deaths  1. Media efforts to promote back sleeping should be stepped up. Easy to read and understandable SIDS informational brochures and other educational materials should be widely distributed on a continual basis across the state to physician offices, public health nurses, public agencies, child care providers, hospital OB departments and other groups who deal directly with infants and their families. 2. Every baby should have its own sleeping place and should not share a sleeping place with parents, whether a potential shared place is a bed, a couch, a chair or the floor. 3. Cribs, bassinets, and other sleeping places should be checked for firmness of mattress and absence of potential causes of smothering, choking or re-breathing, such as pillows, adult blankets, wide spaces between mattress and sides, crib bumper pads, stuffed toys and small items. Sofas, adult beds or chairs, recliners and waterbeds should never be used as an infant bed or sleep surface. 4. Pregnant women, mothers, fathers and other caregivers should be counseled about smoking hazards to children, both before and after their birth. 5. Pregnant women should be counseled as to the potential negative effects on their offspring of illicit drug use and alcohol use during pregnancy. 6. Parents, grandparents and other care providers to neonates and infants should be educated about appropriate sleep position and sleep environment. 7. Physicians should repeatedly counsel pregnant females and parents of very young children about SIDS risk factors, especially if the mother is very young herself, either parent smokes, or the mother is not seeking consistent prenatal care. 8. Special efforts to educate non-English speaking pregnant women and their families about SIDS risk factor should be implemented. 9. Parents should be educated on selection of an appropriate daycare provider who is aware of and follows the ""Back to Sleep"" recommendations, and who provides a smoke-free home in which to care for children.  26   Child Death Review Team Members and the disciplines they represent  Valarie Campbell, MD SIDS Coalition  Jan Mackey Social Worker  Joseph Cowley, PhD Substance Abuse Counselors  Melissa Sally Mueller Emergency Medical Services  Lois Fingerman Domestic Violence  Christine O'Connell Corken County Attorneys  Julia Goodin, MD State Medical Examiner's Office  Kevin Took, MD Mental Health  Barbara Harre, MD Pediatrics  Lon Walker, Chair Law Enforcement  Herman Hein, MD Neonatology  Mona Walters Emergency Room Nurse  Gerald Loos, MD, Vice-chair Family Practice  Robert Wortman Insurance Industry  STATE GOVERNMENT LIAISONS Virginia Barchman Attorney General's Office  Jill France Vital Records, IDPH  Charlotte Burt Department of Education  Dan Moser Department of Public Safety  Scott Falb Department of Transportation  Rosemary Norlin Department of Human Services  Dennis Klein, MD Department of Public Health  Coordinator Stephanie Pettit, PhD Department of Public Health"

The many helpful comments we received from our readers aided us in improving this report, which covers deaths occurring in 1999. In our review process, the team relies on information already gathered by coroners, law enforcement, and medical personnel. The team does not contact the family or friends of children who have died. The team is gratified to know some changes in child health activities have been initiated as a result of our first 2 years of review. In keeping with our objective to identify potential risk factors and preventable causes of death, we hope to be able to provide a basis for changes to reduce child deaths in Idaho. Positive changes that have occurred in Idaho since our last report are:  Graduated Driver's Licensure. You can be licensed in Idaho when you are 15 years old. However, teenagers under 17 years old, must first successfully complete an approved driver's training program. Under Idaho's Graduated Driver's License Program, all drivers must then complete a Supervised Instruction Period (SIP). After completing the SIP, the driver will be eligible to apply for a driver's license. This license will be restricted to driving during daylight hours only until the driver is 16 years old. Daylight hours are defined as from ""1/2 hour before sunrise to 1/2 hour after sunset."" Development of a community-based `System of Care' for children with serious emotional disturbance and their families. The Idaho Council on Children's Mental Health (ICCMH) is leading this effort under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor and through statewide collaboration between the directors of agencies that serve children, advocates and providers of mental health services. Development of a statewide suicide prevention plan. The Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network (SPAN) -Idaho Board of Directors is leading this effort, with support from the Governor's Generation of the Child Initiative, Department of Health and Welfare and other public and private organizations. The purpose of this plan is to coordinate activities related to prevention, survivor support and awareness/education of suicide in Idaho. A pediatric training session for First Responders, EMT's, and Paramedics at each of the 5 Regional Emergency Medical Services conferences. The initial training sessions were pediatric airway or child abuse awareness training.        Challenges that we believe continue to hinder our ability to provide thorough case review and informed recommendations include:  Inability to obtain medical records.  3      Incomplete information on records, such as coroner reports on SIDS deaths, suicides, and other non-motor vehicle accidents. Lack of subpoena power to obtain medical records SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Of 231 deaths in 1999, 128 were presented to the CMRT, and 126 were reviewed:   A review could not be completed on 2 cases presented to the team due to investigations still pending, and incomplete information. Forty-eight (48) Idaho children died in motor vehicle accidents in Idaho in 1999. The team recommends:  A standard (primary) seat belt law that covers all ages and all seating positions.  Child safety restraint education for parents based on National guidelines according to the child's age and size.  Public education on the danger of riding unrestrained in pickup truck beds. The team supports the Department of Education proposed revised rules for minimum course standards for the delivery of teen driver education and training.  Twenty (20) Idaho children died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in Idaho in 1999. The team is concerned about the lack of information available on SIDS deaths and the ongoing behavior of not placing infants on their backs to sleep. We recommend: The CDC SIDS investigation form be used for all cases of suspected SIDS. The form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf. An ongoing effort to educate new mothers about the risk factors that can contribute to SIDS, including advice from the American Academy of Pediatrics that parents and caregivers should place healthy infants on their backs to sleep. www.aap.org/family/infsids.htm  4     Twelve (12) Idaho children died due to suicide in Idaho in 1999. The team was challenged by the lack of a consistent investigation of child suicide deaths and the lack of information regarding the medical, social, school, and psychological history of the victim. We recommend professional education addressing the importance of collecting medical histories, performing thorough scene investigations, conducting psychological autopsies, and toxicological exams on victims of suicide.    Seven (7) Idaho children died due to drowning accidents in Idaho in 1999. The team recommends that small children NEVER be left unsupervised around any container of water large enough for the child to get their head in. This includes mop buckets, toilets, bathtubs, pools, spas and open bodies of water such as canals, rivers and reservoirs.    Seventeen (17) child death reviews were hampered by lack of access to complete records and were so incomplete that preventability could not be determined. The team is concerned about the inability to provide a meaningful review of child deaths due to the lack of information available. We recommend a mechanism to assist the review team in obtaining records surrounding the child death. There are multiple options used successfully by other states including:     Granting the team statutory authority to access applicable records. Statutory authority through a State Medical Examiner system to obtain applicable records. Granting the team subpoena power to request applicable records. Laws protecting the team review documents from discoverability.  5   HISTORY  Concern for the welfare of children, particularly those who are abused or neglected, has been longstanding among public and private social service agencies, professionals, and the general public. In response to this concern, Los Angeles County, California started child mortality review in 1978. Their success in identifying preventable child deaths has led to many states instituting statewide child mortality review teams. The overall goals of the teams include focusing on creating effective multi-agency case management and improving prevention and intervention programs to protect children from serious injury and death. In response to this same concern, then-Governor Philip E. Batt, with Executive Order No. 98-10 (Appendix A), formed Idaho's Child Mortality Review Team on July 16, 1998. The team is appointed by the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare and consists of a multidisciplinary, multi-agency board. Bureaus within the Division of Health and the Idaho Transportation Department's Office of Highway Safety provide support to the team. In 22 years, child mortality review teams have become a national standard in the effort to protect children. According to the National Center on Child Fatality Review, as of 2000, multi-agency child death review teams exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM  The Idaho Child Mortality Review Team represents a combination of public, criminal justice, health, and social service organizations. Team members participate in the review and make decisions by voting on the preventability of the death and identification of prevention activities and target audiences. The following members were appointed to the team by the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare and participated in the 1999 reviews: Matthew Brown, MD, Pediatrician, Chair Shirley Alexander, MSW, Child Protection Program Specialist, and Children at Risk Task Force Member D. Lee Binnion, MD, Emergency Physician Robert Cihak, MD, Pathologist Vicki DeGeus-Morris, Coroner, Canyon County Eve Dickinson, Keeping Children Safe Panel Member, Community Representative 6   Kip Manwaring, Prosecuting Attorney, Bonneville County Christine Hahn, MD, State Epidemiologist Julene Parsons, MD, Pediatrician Tony Wallace, Sgt., Boise Police Department ASSISTANTS TO THE CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM  The Child Mortality Review Team has the support of many state agencies in their efforts to review child deaths. The assistants provide record review and clerical support. They do not have decision making or voting authority on the team. The Epidemiologist and Child Protection Program Specialist from the team meet with the screening group monthly. The following assistants provided support to the team during the 1999 reviews: Dia Gainor, Chief, Emergency Medical Services Bureau Boni Carrell, EMS for Children Planner, Emergency Medical Services Bureau Pam Marcum, Consultant, (former Forensic Scientist, Idaho Department of Law Enforcement) Jo Ann Moore, Manager, Office of Highway Safety Susan Mulkey, IT Production Specialist, Office of Highway Safety Kathy Simplot, Senior Research Analyst, Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics Diane Prince, Administrative Assistant, Bureau of Clinical and Preventive Services Members bring a wide variety of experience and perspectives on children's health, safety, and maltreatment issues. Because of the varied expertise the team possesses, the ability to identify prevention and intervention activities is greatly enhanced.  7   MISSION STATEMENT  To reduce preventable child fatalities through systemic, multidisciplinary, multi-agency review of child fatalities; resulting in data-driven recommendations for legislation, public policy, statewide and community-based prevention education, and systems improvement.  OBJECTIVES  The team has developed the following objectives to direct its work:     Identify potentially preventable causes of death. Identify the risk factors leading to the death. Collect and organize the information into meaningful summaries of causes of child death in Idaho. Make specific and feasible recommendations to the Governor and Chairs of the Senate and House Health and Welfare committees on ways in which child mortality can be reduced in Idaho.  8   METHODOLOGY  Deaths of Idaho resident children, less than 18 years of age, dying in Idaho during 1999 were reviewed. Deaths of children dying out of state were not reviewed since records surrounding circumstances of their deaths are unavailable for the team's use. The Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics identified the child deaths. An abstract of each death certificate was supplied to the screening group, which met monthly to view the abstracts and identify potentially preventable deaths. The screening group selected a death for further review when it met one or more of the following criteria:    Death was due to an external cause, or Death was unexplained, or Death was due to a cause with identified risk factors.  The death was assessed to identify additional information necessary for a comprehensive review. Additional information was requested from the appropriate agency. The sources of information could include:       Autopsy reports Coroner reports Law enforcement reports Medical records Emergency medical system records Child protection records  Recognizing that the records of child deaths and circumstances leading to the deaths are kept by multiple agencies, the team strives to examine the events leading to death across systems and over time. The team does not have subpoena power and cannot always obtain confidential records. Of 231 deaths in 1999, 126 met the criteria for review and additional information was requested. After available records were collected, the assistants reviewed the information, and the cases were prepared for presentation before the Child Mortality Review Team (CMRT). The team, including the assistants, met quarterly. Available information from records on the child deaths were presented with additional input from the team members and assistants. The 126 deaths selected for review included all accident, suicide, homicide, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and deaths of undetermined intent. Eleven of the deaths due to natural causes were also reviewed. Deaths that were not sent for further review included most deaths due to extreme prematurity, cancer, and 9   severe multiple congenital anomalies, unless preventive measures could clearly have reduced the risk of infant death (e.g., trauma leading to a premature birth). Detailed technical notes can be found under Appendix B. Only deaths that were judged to be definitely or probably preventable were considered ""preventable"" for the purposes of this document. The teams' working definition for preventability was: Preventability refers to the ability of an individual or community to reasonably have done something to alter the conditions that led to the child's death, thereby preventing the child's death, or reasonably do something now to reduce the likelihood of future deaths. Examples include, but are not limited to, implementing safety rules, laws, or policies; creating or improving barriers around dangerous areas; educating children or adults in the community; or improving access to health care. The preventability of each death was stratified into categories as outlined by identifying documented risk factors which would have likely contributed to the death. Preventable Definitely Probably Probably not Not preventable Unable to determine Definition Definite actions could have been taken to prevent this death. Certain actions may have decreased the likelihood of this death. This death was probably not preventable. No preventive measures were found.  Risk factors, prevention opportunities, and intervention activities were identified. A data collection form was completed on each case reviewed. If additional records were needed, or specific questions were raised that required more information, a case review was continued at the next meeting. If additional information was unobtainable, the case was considered incomplete, and a determination of preventability was not made. Of the 126 cases presented to the CMRT, 17 cases were considered incomplete and preventability could not be determined. The following table identifies the 17 deaths by manner.

This evidence may illuminate, confirm, or in some cases, contradict the conclusion about cause based solely on external review. Autopsies are an important aspect of many death investigations but are not mandated by Idaho State law.

Of the 231 deaths in 1999, 128 were presented to the CMRT and 126 were reviewed. Of the 126 reviewed deaths, 105 were considered to be preventable after team review; 4 were considered not preventable. Seventeen (17) were classified as unable to determine preventability due to lack of sufficient information. Preventable?

Certain actions may have decreased the likelihood of this death. This death was probably not preventable. No preventive measures were found. 103 2 4 0 17  Two deaths presented to the team were not reviewed because investigations were pending. The cases were:   A fall of a 15 year old from a bridge An unexplained cause of death of an infant  21   NATURAL DEATHS  The rate of death from natural causes in children is highest in the first year of life and generally results from such causes as pregnancy complications, congenital anomalies, and SIDS. Natural causes of death quickly become less common as children grow older. Of the 126 deaths reviewed by the team, 11 were identified as natural. Of the 11 natural deaths preventability could not be determined for 4 deaths due to lack of information. There were 3 natural deaths reviewed in which no preventable measures were found. Four (4) of the deaths were determined to be definitely or probably preventable. Two (2) of the 4 preventable deaths are summarized below. A teenager died due to diabetic coma, due to untreated juvenile diabetes. A child born with multiple birth defects from exposure to the prescription drug Accutane (Isotretinoin) during pregnancy died from cardiopulmonary arrest at a young age.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that parents be made aware of the danger of not getting medical treatment for children who have symptoms of illness.  22   SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS)  SIDS is the leading cause of death in babies from 1 month to 1 year of age. SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and a review of the clinical history. There were 20 SIDS deaths in Idaho in 1999.  Nationally most SIDS deaths occur when a baby is between 1 and 4 months old. In Idaho in 1999 half (10) of SIDS deaths occurred between 1 and 4 months of age.

The table identifies the race and ethnicity of the SIDS deaths in Idaho in 1999.  Idaho SIDS deaths, 1999 Race White Ethnicity Hispanic Non-Hispanic  Number 20 1 19  According to the CDC, an infant who sleeps on its stomach is more at risk for SIDS. Babies who are not breastfed, who are exposed to tobacco smoke, and who get overheated because of too many clothes also seem to be at increased risk, as are infants whose sleeping surface is too soft and excessively padded. The risk increases when a baby shares a bed with an adult; the risk is greater still if more than one adult is in the bed or if the adult is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. SIDS is not caused by vomiting and choking, or minor illnesses such as colds or infections. In Idaho and the rest of the northwest, SIDS rates have been historically higher than the national average. There has been a significant decline in SIDS rates in the U.S. since 1992 (see page 13). The decline is attributable in part to the recognition that SIDS risks decrease with the placement of infants on their backs for sleep and the CDC's ""Back to Sleep"" campaign. Research shows that having infants sleep on their backs reduces the risk of SIDS by 30-50 percent. In Idaho in 1999 the majority of infants who died from SIDS were found on their stomachs when the position was known. Re porte d position w he n found 10 8 6 4 2 0 Stomac h Bac k Side Unknow n  According to the Idaho Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics, ""PRATS: Pregnancy Risk Assessment Tracking System, 1999 Survey"" Idaho resident mothers reported  Nearly two-thirds (62%) put their baby down to sleep on his/her back, most of the time.  Over one-fourth (28.4%) put their baby on his/her side, most of the time.  8.4% reported that they placed their baby on his/her stomach to sleep most of the time.  24   Nine (9) of the 20 SIDS deaths reviewed were thought to be definitely preventable. Many of the 20 SIDS deaths reviewed had modifiable risk factors identified. The risk factors are not exclusive of one another. There can be more than one risk factor identified in each case.  RISK FACTOR Soft bedding Exposure to tobacco smoke Regular sleeping position other than back Co-sleeping with 2 people Co-sleeping with 1 person Infant overheated/overdressed  NUMBER 8 6 3 3 2 0  The ideal sleep surface for infants is firm with no soft items under or near the baby. Thirty percent (6) of the infants dying of SIDS in Idaho in 1999 were in their cribs when they were discovered. The others were found in the following locations:        5 2 2 1 1 1 2 were in beds were on the floor were on sofas in a stroller in a bassinet on a mattress of the records did not state the location of discovery.  Eleven (11) of the SIDS deaths reviewed had insufficient evidence to determine preventability. While the cause of SIDS remains unknown, the risk can be reduced by understanding and being aware of risk factors, but no one behavior can eradicate the risk completely. An infant was breast fed and placed in the crib to sleep. The position the child was placed in to sleep was not documented on any of the available records. The parents checked on the child 6 hours later and found the child not breathing.  Data Gaps For a SIDS diagnosis to be made there has to be a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. Most SIDS deaths did not have a SIDS investigation form completed and much information was missing. For example, reports received did not include information on sleep position, maternal smoking, or sleeping surface. The SIDS investigation form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf  25   1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team is concerned about the lack of information available on SIDS deaths and the ongoing behavior of not placing infants on their backs to sleep. We recommend:  The CDC SIDS investigation form should be used for all cases of suspected SIDS. The SIDS investigation form is available at www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4510.pdf. An ongoing effort to educate new mothers about the risk factors that can contribute to SIDS, including this advice from the American Academy of Pediatrics web site www.aap.org/family/infsids.htm.    Infant Sleep Positioning and SIDS Parents and caregivers should place healthy infants on their backs when putting them down to sleep. This is because recent studies have shown an increase in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) in infants who sleep on their stomachs. There is no evidence that sleeping on the back is harmful to healthy infants. Keep the following points in mind       Placing a child to sleep on the back has the lowest risk and is preferred. Sleeping on the side, however, is a reasonable alternative and is safer than sleeping on the stomach. Do not place your infant to sleep on waterbeds, sofas, soft mattresses, or other soft surfaces. Pillows, quilts, comforters, or sheepskins should not be placed under your infant. Soft materials such as pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, or stuffed toys should be kept out of an infant's bed. These items can cover your child's airway even if he is lying on his back. Devices designed to maintain sleep position or to reduce the risk of rebreathing are not recommended since many have not been tested sufficiently for safety. None have been shown to reduce the risk of SIDS. This recommendation is for healthy infants. Some infants with certain medical conditions or malformations may need to be placed on their stomachs to sleep. For these children, talk to your pediatrician about which sleep position is best. This recommendation is for sleeping infants. A certain amount of ""tummy time,"" while the baby is awake and observed, is recommended for developmental reasons and to avoid flat spots on the head.  Additional tips to reduce the risk of SIDS    Do not smoke during pregnancy; continue to provide Make sure your baby does not become overheated. it feels comfortable for an adult, and dress your baby wear. Share all of these important tips for preventing SIDS caregivers. a smoke-free environment for your baby. Keep the temperature in the baby's room so in as much or little clothing as you would with baby-sitters, grandparents, and other  26   UNINTENTIONAL INJURY  Injuries play a greater role in mortality as children grow older. Injuries are the leading cause of death in children from 1-17 years of age. Of the 126 deaths reviewed by the team, injuries claimed the lives of 92 children; the majority (73) of the deaths were unintentional. Unintentional injuries are those that appear to occur by chance. Intentional injuries are those that appear to have been planned or are inflicted by a person. Suicide and Homicide are intentional injuries. The classification of injuries into two categories, intentional and unintentional, allows emphasis to be placed on prevention activities. The phrase ""unintentional injury"" is used in this document interchangeably with accident. Unintentional injuries are generally understandable, predictable, and most importantly, preventable. Understanding injury patterns is key to prevention. Each type of unintentional injury has a particular pattern, based on the following factors:       Age Gender Developmental level: physical, mental, emotional Presence of injury opportunities such as all-terrain vehicles, backyard swimming pools, firearms, kerosene heaters, etc. Access to and use of bike helmets, seat belts, smoke detectors, etc. Lack of appropriate supervision  Several characteristics are common to most types of injuries. Nationally injury rates are greatest in:   Low socioeconomic groups, especially urban African-American children and American Indians/Alaska Natives Males  Nationally the leading causes of fatal childhood unintentional injury are motor vehicle accidents, fires/burns, drowning, falls, and poisoning.  27   The leading causes of unintentional injury deaths in Idaho in 1999 were motor vehicle accidents, drowning, and suffocation.

Traffic collisions are those occurring on a public roadway. Non-traffic collisions are those that occur on private property. In 1999 there were 48 MVA fatalities resulting from 46 separate collisions. Forty-four (44) of the fatalities and 42 accidents were classified as traffic. Four (4) fatalities and 4 accidents were classified as non-traffic. Statistics in this section use the number of fatalities (48) in the denominator unless otherwise noted.

Of the 3 pedestrians involved in traffic accidents, 1 was walking on the interstate in the dark, one was sitting in the roadway after dark, and one was crossing a highway and was under the influence of alcohol. Of the 3 cyclists that were involved in traffic accidents, 2 failed to stop at a stop sign, and 1 was riding on a highway at night without lights. The skateboarder was being pulled behind a car, fell, and was run over.

Research shows children are more likely to be restrained in vehicles if adults use seat belts. The statistics about safety devices include only those fatalities occurring in traffic accidents. Twenty five (25) of the 30 fatally injured children and teens age 4 or over in vehicles were not restrained.

Child Sa fe ty Se a t Correctl y Used at Ti m e of Collision  Only 2 of 5 children under the age of 4 were correctly restrained in a child safety seat at the time of the collision.

Yes 2 40%  No 3 60%  31   According to the ""Idaho Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System Report, 1999"" random phone survey conducted by the Bureau of Vital Records and Health Statistics   Over nine of ten (92.1%) Idaho adult residents with children under the age of 5 in their household reported that the child always rides in a child safety seat in the car. Nearly nine out of ten (89.1%) Idaho adult residents with children between the ages of 5 and 16 reported that the child wears a seatbelt always or nearly always while riding in a car.  Helmets save lives, just like seat belts do. According to research done at Harborview Medical Center Injury Prevention and Research Center at the University of Washington in Seattle, overall, helmets decrease the risk of head and brain injury by 85 to 88 percent and facial injury to the upper and mid face by 65 percent. None of the 6 children who died while on bicycles, skateboards, or motorcycles were wearing helmets at the time of their injury. Contributing Circumstances For every vehicle involved in a traffic collision in Idaho, the investigating officer may indicate up to 3 circumstances contributing to the cause of the collision on the collision report. Failure to yield was the most common contributing circumstance in fatal collisions involving children. Too fast for conditions and inattention were the second and third most common circumstances identified on vehicle collision reports. Contributing Circumstances Failure to yield Too fast for conditions Inattention Speeding Passed stop sign Im paired driver Overcorrected Distraction in / on vehicle No lights Mechanical Failure Bright headlights Tire defect Drove left of center Falling object Victim sitting in roadw ay Victim fell out of vehicle Poor w eather / Road conditions Im proper overtaking Vision obstruction Im proper backing Drow sy / Asleep  Number of collisions in which factor was present  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  32   The CMRT reviews from 1997-1999 reveal consistency in the contributing circumstances associated with fatal collisions in children. The top 3 contributing circumstances over 3 years are:    Inattention Driving too fast for conditions Speeding  Driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol is documented as Impaired Driver and is in the top 7 for all 3 years. Drugs and Alcohol There are 2 reasons making it difficult to link the impact of alcohol to fatal collisions involving children. 1. Idaho law requires only the blood of drivers and pedestrians dying in motor vehicle collisions to be tested for alcohol (Idaho Code 49-1314). At fault drivers who do not die may not be tested for alcohol/drugs. 2. Results from the tests that are performed are not always available. Of the 46 motor vehicle traffic collisions that resulted in 48 child fatalities, 28 of the drivers of vehicle(s) involved in the collisions were tested for drugs and / or alcohol. Of the 28 tested, 8 had positive results of substance(s) in the bloodstream, 8 of the results were unavailable at the time of review, and the other 13 had negative results. In 1999 the review team was able to positively identify 7 collisions in which alcohol contributed to the collision:     In 2 collisions the child who died was driving with a blood alcohol level at or above the legal limit. In 2 collisions the child was a passenger in a vehicle being driven by a driver under the influence of alcohol. In 1 bicycle/ car collision the driver of the vehicle was under the influence of alcohol. In 1 pedestrian collision the pedestrian was under the influence of alcohol  Young Drivers According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, on the basis of miles driven, teenagers are involved in three times as many fatal crashes as are all drivers. Why do young drivers have such poor driving performance? Three factors work together to make the teen years so deadly for young drivers:  33   Inexperience: All young drivers start out with very little knowledge or understanding of the complexities of driving a motor vehicle. Like any other skill, learning to drive well takes a lot of time. Risk-taking behavior and immaturity: Adolescent impulsiveness is a natural behavior, but it results in poor driving judgment and participation in high-risk behaviors such as speeding, inattention, drinking and driving, and not using a seat belt. Peer pressure also often encourages risk taking. Greater risk exposure: Teen drivers are different from other drivers, and their crash experience is different. Compared to other drivers, a higher proportion of teenagers are responsible for their fatal crashes because of their own driving errors:     A larger percentage of fatal crashes involving teenage drivers are single vehicle crashes. The vehicle usually leaves the road and overturns or hits a roadside object such as a tree or a pole. In general, a smaller percentage of teens wear their seat belts compared to other drivers. A larger proportion of teen fatal crashes involve speeding, or going too fast for road conditions, compared to other drivers. Two of three teens who die as passengers are in vehicles driven by other teenagers. Single Ve hicle Tra ffic Collisions by Age in Ida ho 1999  Older children were more likely to die in single vehicle accidents such as rollovers, although the number of multiple car accidents in this age group increased as well.  25 20 15 10 5 0  <1 Multiple V ehic le  1- 4 5- 14 Single V ehic le  15- 17*  The following are examples of deaths that might have been prevented. Victim in vehicle driven by underage driver who lost control on gravel road. Vehicle rolled. The victim, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was ejected. Driver and other passenger, who were wearing seatbelts, sustained injuries but survived. Victim failed to yield to an oncoming semi-truck. Victim was not wearing a seatbelt. Passenger was wearing a seatbelt and sustained injuries but survived.  34   Motor Vehicle Non-traffic Accidents Non-traffic accidents occur on private property so law enforcement does not complete a collision record thus there is less information available for review. The following case summaries illustrate the variety of non-traffic accidents that occur.  A child was backed over in the family driveway. A child fell out of the back of a hay trailer. A child fell out of the back of a flatbed truck and was run over. A child riding a tricycle up and down the family driveway ran into a stock trailer passing by on the road.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations  The team recommends a standard (primary) seat belt law that covers all ages and all seating positions based on the following information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Seat belts work. They are the most effective means of reducing fatalities and serious injuries when traffic crashes occur and are estimated to save 9,500 lives in America each year. Research has found that lap/shoulder belts, when used properly, reduce the risk of fatal injury to front seat passenger car occupants by 45 % and the risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50 %. For light truck occupants, seat belts reduce the risk of fatal injury by 60 % and moderate-to-critical injury by 65 %. http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/presbelt/america_seatbelt.html The team recommends child safety restraint education for parents based on the following information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Child safety seats work. Children, especially those under the age of 5, are vulnerable in collisions because of the size and shape of their bodies. The child safety seat is designed to spread the forces of a crash over more of the body for front-facing toddlers, and cradle the fragile neck and back of the rear-facing infant. Child safety seats are the most effective occupant protection devices used in motor vehicles today. If used correctly, they are 71 % effective in reducing fatalities in children under the age of 5 and 69 % effective in reducing the need for hospitalization. About 50 % of children under age 5 who died in crashes were 35   unrestrained. Of the remaining 50 %, 26 % were in an adult seat belt which does not provide effective protection for most children under age 5. Others were in a child restraint system, but had not been restrained properly. In studies conducted by NHTSA to observe child safety seat misuse, nearly 80 % of the child seats observed were misused in one or more ways. In some cases, the seat was not properly attached to the vehicle; in others, the child was not appropriately buckled into the seat. http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/airbags/presbelt/america_seatbelt.html  Proper Child Safety Seat Use Chart Buckle Everyone.

""Kids Aren't Cargo"" a public safety campaign from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tells of the dangers of riding in the open bed of a pickup and how those dangers can be prevented. The dangers include:   Nationally children and teenagers account for more than half of the deaths of passengers riding in the bed of a truck. Ejection is the most significant cause of injury and death for pickup truck cargo area passengers in collisions. Even if no collision occurs, cargo area passengers can fall out during swerving, braking or on rough roads. One third of non-collision deaths occurred when victims are standing up, sitting on the tailgate or ""horsing around."" www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/outreach/safesobr/18qp2/cpsw18.htm    36   The team supports the Department of Education proposed revised rules for driver's education. The draft proposed rules include minimum course standards for the delivery of teen driver education and training. The standards for the teen driver education and training program are the same for public and commercial schools. While a majority of the commercial school owners support minimum standards for teen driver education and training, some commercial schools want licensing without regulations. The Idaho Department of Education must exercise a degree of administrative discretion, consistent with the intent of the governing rule or law, to carry out its duties. Teen driver education is a public safety and health issue and the proposed draft rules for minimum standards for teen driver education and training take this into consideration. The team recommends that drivers education address at a minimum information on the dangers of:        Failure to yield the right of way Running or rolling through stop signs Driving too fast for conditions (especially ice or snow) Exceeding the posted speed limit Following too close Running or pushing the red light Failing to use safety restraints  The team makes the following recommendations for improving bicycle safety in Idaho:        Provide motorist education on sharing roadways safely. Develop bike lanes and paths to accommodate bicyclists. Provide access and linkage between bike paths and lanes. Provide safe bicycling routes around schools. Provide bicycle safety education to children and their parents including the importance of helmet use. Provide low cost bicycle helmets. Enforce existing bicycle-related regulations.  37   DROWNING AND SUBMERSION  Drowning is the second leading cause of injury-related death for children aged 1 through 14 years. Knowledge is a powerful tool for combating these tragedies. Knowing how and where children drown provides a basis for prevention. In Idaho in 1999, 7 deaths of children under the age of 18 were identified and presented to the team. All 7 were reviewed and all were determined to be definitely preventable. Nationally, drowning rates are highest for children under 5 years of age and persons 15-24 years of age. Young children are irresistibly drawn to water. The majority of childhood drowning deaths occur in a matter of seconds, usually when a child is left unattended or during a brief lapse in supervision In Idaho in 1999, 4 drowning deaths were children under the age of 5. 3  Idaho Drowning De aths by Age , 1999  2  1  0 <1 1-4 5 -9 1 0 -1 4 15-1 7  Nationally in 1999, 70% of children between the ages of 1 and 17 who died from drowning were male.

For example, children under age 1 most often drown in bathtubs, buckets, and toilets. Children 1-4 most often drown in swimming pools, hot tubs, or spas. Children aged 5-14 typically drown in swimming pools or open water, such as lakes and rivers.  IDAHO DEATH Age of Child <1 1-4 1-4 1-4 5-14 5-14 15-17  S BY DROWNING 1999 Location of Drowning Bathtub Canal Fish Pond Swimming Pool Swimming Pool Canal Reservoir  In Idaho in 1999 there was 1 drowning death in open water, unlike 1998 when 7 of the 12 drowning deaths under the age of 18 occurred in rivers. Taking simple prevention measures and close supervision of children can help protect them from drowning. Six (6) of the 7 drowning deaths in Idaho in 1999 had lack of supervision as a contributing factor. A child fenced on the bottom drowned in the family swimming pool in their back yard. The pool was and locked with a picnic table against the fence. The adult supervisor was phone when the child was noticed to be missing. The child was found at the of the pool.  A child was playing in the front yard. The adult supervisor went into a motor home for no more than 5 minutes. When the adult came back, the child was missing. The child was found in a canal near his home.  39   1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that public education be provided on the following:  Small children should NEVER be left unsupervised around any container of water large enough for the child to get their head in. This includes mop buckets, toilets, bathtubs, pools, spas and open bodies of water such as canals, rivers and reservoirs. Children should wear a U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device (PFD) when on boats, near open bodies of water, and when participating in water sports that do not require swimming. Water wings are not considered safety devices and are not substitutes for PFD. Parents should not rely on PFD or swimming lessons alone to protect children. Pools and spas should be fenced. Fences should be at least 5 feet tall, foursided (to prevent access from the house), and have self-closing and selflatching gates. Items that could be used by children to provide access over fencing (such as tables and chairs) should not be pushed up against pool fences. Children under the age of 15 years should not operate personal watercraft.         40   FIRE AND BURNS  In Idaho in 1999, 5 children lost their lives in 2 separate fires. All 5 deaths were presented to the team; all were determined to be definitely preventable. The national statistics and information presented in this section are reported by the National SAFEKIDS Campaign. Children ages 5 and under are more than twice as likely to die in a fire as the rest of the population. In Idaho in 1999, 2 of the 5 children were under the age of 6. Ida ho Fi re Re la te d De a ths, Age < 18, 1999  2  1  0 1-4 5-9 10-15  Nationally, more than 70% of all fire-related deaths are from smoke inhalation caused by toxic gases produced as fires develop and spread. In Idaho in 1999 all 5 of the fire related deaths were due to smoke inhalation. Children are often at risk due to their own curiosity. Studies indicate that an estimated 38 percent of children ages 6 to 14 have played with fire at least once. Child-play fires are the leading cause of fire-related death for children 5 and under. Nearly 80 percent of these are started with matches or lighters. Boys are nearly twice as likely as girls to play with fire. In Idaho in 1999, 2 of the children dying in 1 of the fires were thought to have been playing with matches. Children are at grave risk of injury and death from residential fires because they have less control of their environment than adults and limited ability to react appropriately. More than 40 percent of residential fire-related deaths among children ages 9 and under occur when the child is attempting to escape, is unable to act, or is acting irrationally. Children in homes without working smoke alarms are at the greatest risk. Households without working smoke alarms are approximately two and a half times more likely to have a fire. In Idaho in 1999, 3 of the children dying in 1 of the fires were sleeping at the time of the fire and were found in an area of the residence that would suggest they were trying to get out. It is unknown if smoke alarms were present or working at the time of the fire. Home fires and fire-related deaths are more likely to occur during the cold weather months, December through February, when there is a significant rise in the use of portable or area heating equipment such as fireplaces, space heaters and wood stoves. 41   Three (3) children died in 1 fire. The fire occurred during the cold weather months and was determined to be due to blocked vents on the heater.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team supports the public education efforts of fire departments regarding smoke alarms and fire prevention including:     Changing batteries in smoke alarms twice a year when daylight savings time changes. Replacing smoke alarms every 10 years. Providing a low or no cost source for smoke alarms. Providing education that combustible materials must be kept away from heaters and electrical connections.  42   FIREARMS [UNINTENTIONAL]  In Idaho in 1999 there were 2 unintentional firearm deaths. Both were reviewed by the team and determined to be definitely preventable. All children are potentially at risk for unintentional firearm injury regardless of whether there are guns in the home or children know the rules about handling guns. Knowing how and why the injuries occur can substantially reduce the risk. According to the National SAFEKIDS Campaign nearly all childhood unintentional shooting deaths occur in or around the home. Half occur in the home of the victim and nearly 40 percent occur at a friend or relative's house. Most of these deaths involve guns that have been kept loaded and accessible to children and occur when children play with the guns. In Idaho in 1999, 1 death occurred at home and 1 while hunting. Rates of unintentional firearm-related injury are higher in rural areas, where people are more likely to own firearms. Shootings in rural areas are more likely to occur outdoors with a shotgun or rifle; in cities, most shootings occur indoors with a handgun. In Idaho in 1999 both unintentional shootings were with a rifle or shotgun. One occurred outdoors while hunting. The other occurred at the victim's home while loading and unloading rifles. Boys are far more likely to be injured and die from firearm-related incidents than girls. Of children killed in unintentional shootings, nearly 80 percent are male. In Idaho in 1999 both unintentional firearm victims were male. A teenager was hunting with 3 friends. Evidence and testing of the shotgun showed that the gun was probably dropped and it discharged. A teenager was at home with a friend. They were handling 2 rifles, loading and unloading them. One of the rifles was dropped and it fired.  43   SUFFOCATION AND STRANGULATION  In 1999, 6 children died from unintentional suffocation or strangulation. All of these deaths were reviewed. Five (5) of the 6 were determined to be definitely preventable and the preventability of 1 was unable to be determined.  In Idaho in 1999, 4 children died due to strangulation and 2 children died due to airway obstruction/aspiration.  Idaho Deaths Due to Suffocation/Strangulation, 1999 3 2 1 0 Strangul1-i4 n at o Suffocation  5-9 10-14 Age in years  15-17  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends public education to increase awareness of:     The problem of choking. Items that can present a choking hazard. Ages at which children are at highest risk for choking by various items. The importance of adult supervision when young children are eating and playing.  The team acknowledges that complete removal of all choking hazards is unlikely and recommends that all parents be trained in infant and child foreign body airway obstruction.   Instruction on choking intervention should be incorporated into all layperson CPR and first aid courses. Health-care providers should provide parents and caregivers instruction in how to treat infant and child foreign body obstruction.  44   OTHER UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES  There were 5 deaths that occurred from other unintentional injuries. All 5 were determined to be definitely preventable. Following are summaries of the 5 cases.  Two children died while making a makeshift tunnel at a landfill. The walls collapsed and the children died of crushing injuries. One child died when crushed by a bale of hay being unloaded with a forklift. One child died after a homemade cannon exploded. One child died from a pulmonary hemorrhage. Pathologists concluded it was caused by gastric contents or possibly some kind of inhalant.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations  The team recommends parent education on how to determine which farm-related tasks are appropriate at given ages. Guidelines can be found at: www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/youthdevelopment/DA6188.html. The team recommends adult supervision during hay unloading operations. Guidelines for enssuring children are ready and able to be involved in hay unloading operations can be found at: www.nagcat.org/poster/hay/loadhay.htm  45   INTENTIONAL SELF-HARM (SUICIDE)  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1999 suicide was the third leading cause of death for young people 10-17 years in the United States and the second leading cause of death for the same age group in Idaho. Idaho was ranked 4th in the nation in 1999 for the rate of suicide injury deaths of children aged 10 to 17 years. Twelve (12) suicides occurred in Idaho in 1999. All 12 cases were reviewed by the team and were determined to be definitely preventable. Ten (10) of those who died from suicide were ages 15-17. Two (2) of the victims were under the age of 15. Although suicide among children ages 10-14 is considered a rare event, Idaho had 4 deaths in both 1997 and 1998 in the 10-14 age group.

The teenager reportedly had below average grades, interpersonal problems with friends, and had been grounded and was unable to attend a family function. A teenager committed suicide by shooting. The teenager had a history of depression and alcohol/drug use and had made prior suicide attempts. Data Gaps  The team was challenged by the lack of a consistent investigation of suicide deaths and the lack of information regarding the medical, social, and psychological history of the victim. 1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team supports the Department of Health and Welfare and their public and private partners in the development of a statewide suicide prevention plan. We would like to see the following issues addressed in the plan:        Promote public awareness that adolescent suicide is a problem that can be prevented. Work with the media to ensure news coverage of suicides is not sensationalized. Work with staff at schools having had a student suicide to ensure that response to the suicide is not sensationalized and to support peers in an effort to prevent future suicides. Provide training to primary care providers and natural community helpers on recognizing and responding to adolescents showing signs of suicide risk. Include information on referral resources. Provide information to parents of children who are at risk for suicide on recognizing and responding to signs of potential attempts. Provide information on referral resources. Provide information to parents of adolescents at risk for suicide on the necessity of securing guns and ammunition. Provide professional education to improve suicide investigations by thorough collection of medical histories, improved scene investigations, enhanced systems for conducting psychological autopsies, and toxicological exams.  47   ASSUALT (HOMICIDE)  The rate of homicide in Idaho is lower than the United States. There were 7 deaths due to homicide in Idaho in 1999. All 7 were presented to the team. Six (6) cases were reviewed. Of the 6 reviewed cases, all were determined to be definitely preventable. The 1 death that was not reviewed was originally diagnosed as SIDS and the investigation was still pending at the time of review. This death was later determined to be homicide after a confession and a subsequent conviction. This death is included in the following statistics although preventability was not determined by the team. The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 1999 that the killing of children under the age of 5 years increased in the last 2 decades but has recently been on the decline. In Idaho in 1999, 6 of the 7 (85.7%) victims of homicide were less than 5 years old. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a parent, including stepparents, is the perpetrator in most homicides of children under age 5. Five (5) of the 7 (71.4%) homicide death victims in Idaho in 1999 were killed by a parent (2 by fathers, 3 by mothers). Two (2) children died as the result of a double homicide followed by suicide of the father.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends that public education take place to raise awareness that all citizens become aware of signs of child abuse and that citizens be educated on the signs that indicate that a parent or caretaker is too stressed to care for a child. An abused or neglected child is one whose physical or psychological health or development is harmed by the parents' (or caretaker's) behavior. Child abuse includes physical abuse, physical neglect, sexual abuse and emotional abuse of a child under 18 years of age by a parent- or by another family member or caretaker.  48   Types of Abuse Physical Abuse  What does that mean? A non-accidental injury to a child by a parent or caretaker.  How do I recognize It? You may see frequent and unexplained bruises, burns, cuts, injuries; the child may be overly afraid of the parent's reaction to misbehavior. You may see a very young child routinely left alone at home. You may know that a severe illness or injury is not being medically treated. A neighbor child may frequently turn up at your door-inadequately dressed for the weather-saying their parent told them to stay away. Physical neglect can be hard to judge; sometimes what you see is poor judgment, but not neglect. Sometimes what you see is the result of poverty, not parental neglect. You may observe sexual behavior way beyond what is expected for the child's age; a young child might have sudden, unusual difficulty with toilet habits; there may be pain or itching, bruises or bleeding in the genital area. The child might tell you.  Physical Neglect  A parent or caretaker's failure to give the child food, clothing, hygiene, medical care and supervision.  Sexual Abuse  Ranges from offenses such as promoting prostitution, to fondling, intercourse, or using the child for pornographic materials.  49   MANNER UNDETERMINED  For 3 deaths to children in 1999 the manner could not be determined, even after autopsy. A child died from asphyxiation. A young child died from herniation of the brainstem. A young child died from a skull fracture.  50   FIREARMS IN INJURY DEATHS  This section contains aggregate data and includes unintentional injury, intentional injury, and deaths with undetermined intent. There were 13 firearm deaths of children in Idaho in 1999. Firearms were the second leading cause of injury death in Idaho in 1999. Only motor vehicle accidents claimed more young lives. The majority of firearm deaths were due to suicide. In 11 cases the weapon was used to intentionally harm (suicide and homicide). In 2 cases a loaded weapon was dropped. 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Idaho Fir ear m Dea th by Manner Ages 0-17 19 99  8 Su icid e  3 Hom icid e  2 Accid ent  Nearly two-thirds (62.5 %) of suicides by firearm were committed with a rifle.

Almost 1 in 9 (11.6%) adults with children less than 18 years of age has a loaded gun in the home. Approximately 1 in 24 (4.2%) adults with children less than 18 years of age has a loaded gun in his/her vehicle.  Nearly half (46.2%) of the firearms used in child deaths in Idaho in 1999 belonged to an adult member of the victim's family.  1999 Conclusions and recommendations The team recommends public education on firearm storage including the following messages:       Firearms should be stored unloaded and locked out of children's reach. Ammunition should be stored in a separate, locked location from firearms. Gun storage keys and lock combinations should be hidden in separate locations. Gun locks and load indicators could prevent more than 30 percent of all unintentional firearms deaths. (www.safekids.org) Low cost gun locks should be made available. Children should be taught the following by their caregivers: o Guns are dangerous. o Never touch or play with guns. o To tell an adult if they find a gun, or to call 911 if they find a gun when an adult is not present. o Gun violence on TV and in the movies is not real. Caregivers should check with neighbors, friends, relatives, or other adults in other homes where children visit to ensure they are following safe storage practices if firearms are in the home.    52   APPENDIX A THE OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT STATE OF IDAHO BOISE EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 98-10 CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW TEAM WHEREAS, the health and safety of Idaho children are of primary importance; and WHEREAS, the child death rate in Idaho exceeds that of the nation; and WHEREAS, some child deaths are due to preventable causes; and WHEREAS, records of children's deaths and circumstances leading to their death are kept by multiple agencies but not coordinated, on-going effort is being made to evaluate these records; and WHEREAS, expertise exists within the state to evaluate these records and identify circumstances leading to or contributing to the deaths of children; and WHEREAS, the identification of risk producing circumstances and recommendations to remediate them may reduce child death rates; NOW THEREFORE, I, PHILIP E.

PHILIP E. BATT GOVERNOR PETE T. CENARRUSA SECRETARY OF STATE  54   APPENDIX B  TECHNICAL NOTES REGARDING SIGNIFICANCE TESTING For significant testing of all rates contained in this report: p=.05. Three statistical tests were performed for each cause, area, or year. If the test outcomes did not match, the more frequent outcome was reported. For causes, areas, or years in which the rate is based on 100 or more events, the following tests were performed: 1) Evaluate overlapping confidence intervals at p=.05. If the confidence intervals of the rates do not overlap, the rates are significantly different. 2) Evaluate the test statistic. If the z statistic is greater than or equal to the test statistic (1.96), the rates are significantly different. 3) If the confidence interval for the ratio of rates does not contain the value of 1, the rates are significantly different. For causes, areas, or years in which the rate is based on less than 100 events, the following tests were performed: 1) Evaluate overlapping confidence intervals at p=.05. If the confidence intervals of the rates do not overlap, the rates are significantly different. 2) Evaluate the test statistic. If the Difference of Rates is greater than or equal to the z statistic, the rates are significantly different. 3) If the confidence interval of the Difference in Rates does not contain the value of 0, the rates are significantly different. TECHNICAL NOTES REGARDING THE ICD-9 / ICD-10 CONVERSION Cause-of-Death Classification Mortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, which specify that member nations, including the United States, classify and code causes of death in accordance with the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. The tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was implemented in the United States beginning with deaths occurring in 1999 and replaces the ninth revision of the ICD (ICD-9), which was used from 1979 through 1998. Some changes from ICD-9 to ICD-10 include: 1. ICD-10 is far more detailed than ICD-9, with about 8,000 categories compared to 4,000 categories. 2. ICD-10 uses 4-digit alphanumeric codes, compared to 4-digit numeric codes in ICD-9. 3. Some cause-of-death titles have been changed, and conditions have been regrouped. 4. Some cause-of-death coding rules have been changed.  55   Comparability Ratio The change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 may result in discontinuities in cause-of-death trends. These discontinuities are measured using comparability ratios. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) developed comparability ratios to measure the level of agreement between classification systems for causes of death. The comparability ratio is the result of a study completed by the NCHS in which a sample of the U.S. mortality data file was coded by both the new (ICD-10) and the old revision (ICD-9) codes. Comparability ratio: Number of deaths for a cause of death based on ICD-10 code(s)________ Number of deaths for a cause based on the most comparable ICD-9 code(s) A comparability ratio of 1.00 indicates that the same number of deaths were assigned to a particular cause whether ICD-9 or ICD-10 was used. A comparability ratio of less than 1.00 indicates fewer deaths occurred in 1999 compared with 1976-1998, solely because of the revision of the ICD. For example, a ratio of 0.98 (MVA deaths) indicates there were 2% fewer deaths (1.00-0.98) for this cause because of the code revision. A comparability ratio of more than 1.00 indicates more deaths occurred from this cause in 1999 compared with 1976-1998, only because of the implementation of ICD-10. A ratio of 1.04 (SIDS deaths) indicates 4% more deaths (absolute difference of 1.04-1.00) were attributed to the cause using ICD-10 than would have been using ICD-9. Comparability ratios for select causes of death have been revised since preliminary comparability ratios were released. NCHS revised ratios for motor vehicle accidents. The comparability ratio for motor vehicle accidents was updated after a change in the classification of motor vehicle accidents. Originally, for a death to be classified as a motor vehicle accident in ICD-10, it must be explicit that the injury involved a ""motor"" vehicle, even if the injury occurred on a highway or road. In ICD-9, the absence of the term ""motor"" or when a vehicle accident was reported as occurring on a highway or road, the assumption was to classify the accident as involving a motor vehicle. ICD-10 did not allow for this assumption and such accidents are categorized as ""Other"" land transport accidents. Since the implementation of ICD-10, however, for U.S. data, it has been decided that, if an accident occurred on a highway or road, classification to motor vehicle accident is appropriate. Idaho data published prior to this report may not reflect this change. Since this update was implemented, Idaho deaths due to motor vehicle accidents have been revised and are comparable to U.S. data. Revised data are available upon request. To show trends in data, NCHS has instructed states to treat ICD-10 as the standard and adjust statistics prior to 1999 using comparability ratios. Therefore, mortality statistics provided in this report are NOT comparable to previously published mortality statistics based on ICD-9 codes.  56   For example, in 1999 there were 21 Idaho resident deaths from SIDS based on ICD-10 codes. In 1998, there were 20 deaths from SIDS, based on the ICD-9 codes. At first glance, one would conclude the number of SIDS deaths increased by 5% from 1998 to 1999. However, because of changes in coding rules for ICD, these two counts are not comparable. Beginning in 1999 a change in Rule A affects the coding of SIDS deaths. In ICD-9 SIDS was treated as an ill-defined condition and ignored in the presence of other better-defined conditions listed on the death certificate. In ICD-10, SIDS is not considered to be ill-defined. Thus, in ICD-10, SIDS may be selected as the underlying cause of death even when other conditions are listed on the death certificate. Thus, deaths classified as SIDS in ICD-10 may have been classified to other causes using ICD-9. The ICD-10 to ICD-9 comparability ratio for SIDS is 1.04. In other words, the counts and rates for SIDS were expected to increase 4% beginning in 1999 only because of the introduction of ICD-10. To compare the number of SIDS deaths in 1998 with the number of deaths in 1999 multiply 1998 data by the comparability ratio. Number of deaths in 1998 (not comparable with 1999 data) 20 Number of deaths in 1998, comparable with number of deaths in 1999 (rounded) 21 Number of deaths in 1999 21  X  Comparability Ratio 1.04  =  In this report, trend data are presented for SIDS, Motor Vehicle Accidents, Suicide, and Firearm deaths.

The Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County: Results from the Hmong Health Survey report attempts to fill a gap in knowledge within the county regarding the health of Hmong-Americans, a group which has unique socio-cultural features that may complicate the delivery of healthcare services. Results from the survey illustrate the condition of Hmong-Americans in Orange County:  It suggests high proportions of Hmong-Americans are without health insurance, are not participating in health-promoting behaviors, and lack knowledge about access to and navigation of the County's healthcare system.  It affirms the need to address linguistic isolation as a meaningful barrier to healthcare access.  It reinforces the need for health providers to prepare themselves, their facilities, and staff to provide culturally competent medical care and health-promoting services to their Hmong-American clientele. Professionals are encouraged to reach out to Hmong-Americans in a manner that respects and encourages their native lifestyles, while facilitating access to and adaptation of those mainstream behaviors and medicines that promote health. We hope you will use this report to identify the health needs of the Hmong-Americans in your community--and to challenge your organization to respond to these unique needs.

Many suffer from the difficulties associated with low socio-economic status, cultural dissonance, low levels of education, linguistic isola tion, and difficulties in accessing health care. In order to describe health care among Hmong-Americans in Orange County, we conducted a survey that was administered by a Hmong-speaking researcher within the Hmong-American community. The Hmong Health Survey yielded several important findings.  Results suggested many Hmong-Americans in Orange County might not be engaging in health promotion behaviors. Thirty-six percent of respondents reported not participating in any preventive health maintenance behaviors.  A large proportion of Hmong-Americans in Orange County may lack access to basic medical services since over 30% of Hmong surveyed were uninsured.  Substantial linguistic barriers may exist which inhibit optimal medical care. Only one in ten respondents had doctors who spoke their language. Among those linguistically incompat ible with their physician, over four in ten never had their doctor provide translation ser vices, and almost one in four never brought a translator to a doctor visit. Subsequently, it is possible significant linguistic barriers to proper medical treatments exist among Hmong in the county.  Over half of Hmong-Americans surveyed used Hmong and/or Chinese herbal remedies. Physicians should be aware that such treatments might be performed prior to, during the course of, or in lieu of conventional Western medical techniques.  Many of those surveyed were unaware of the availability of low cost medical services provided by the County of Orange. Two of three respondents were unaware of such services, suggesting additional efforts may be necessary in educating this community about their health care options.  Results suggest the dissemination of county health care information to Hmong-Americans would be best communicated in Hmong or Lao languages within home and community center settings.  1  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County INTRODUCTION It has been a quarter of a century since the first significant wave of Hmong refugees resettled in the United States. Some have been able to adjust to the new environment, while others were unprepared for the cultural differences they experienced. For these persons, it has been difficult, often frustrating, to learn the language, living skills, traditions, regulations, and job skills necessary to function effectively in the U.S. Hmong in the United States suffer from a high degree of poverty, with a 1990 median household income of $14,327 (True and Guillermo, 1996). According to 1990 U.S. Census statistics, over 60% of HmongAmericans live in poverty; less than 6% have completed college; and only 29% participate in the labor force (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001). Cultural differences and misunderstandings also complicate interactions between Hmong-Americans and Ameri can institutions (Barrett et al., 1998). Consequently, this sub-population has encountered significant barriers to the access and utilization of health care services in the United States. Prior to this report, there had been no formal attempts to characterize the cultural and linguistic issues affecting Hmong-American access to health care in Orange County. This report describes aspects of Hmong-American use of Western medicine, adherence to traditional medical practices, linguistic barriers, medical problems and knowledge/attitudes regarding county medical services in Orange County. The Hmong Health Survey was also intended to inform future efforts of a similar nature. This report contains a brief background of Hmong history, details methods used in data acquisition, presents and interprets survey findings, and discusses recommendations based upon key results.  History of the Hmong The Hmong are a people with a long and sometimes turbulent past. However, due to the relatively recent development of a written Hmong language and to multiple geographic migrations, much of Hmong history beyond 5,000 years ago remains speculative. The Hmong originated in Northern China, where they competed with the Chinese for rich soil along the banks of the Yellow River (Quincy, 1995). The Chinese made war on the Hmong and drove them South to what today is known as the Hupeh and Hunan prov inces, where the Hmong then established an independent kingdom. In the tenth century, the Hmong were conquered, and thousands taken as slaves. Those who escaped the Hupeh/Hunan region fled to the mountainous areas of Kweichow, Szechwan, and Yunnan, where, in the 18th and 19th centuries, they were again attacked by the Chinese (Quincy, 1995). Thousands of Hmong then fled China to Northern Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Burma (Mottin, 1980). Many made their home in the mountain ranges of Laos, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. In 1961, General Vang Pao, a Hmong leader in Laos, was appointed by the United States Central Intelli gence Agency to raise an army of Hmong and train them in intelligence and combat tactics as Special Guerrilla Units (SGU) against North Vietnamese and Pathet-Lao communists. During their fifteen years of armed service, skilled Hmong units protected American personnel, rescued American pilots, and dis rupted the flow of communist military personnel, supplies, trucks, and tanks traveling along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Such involvement resulted in thousands of Hmong military casualties as well as the death of many Hmong civilians. After the United States withdrew from Southeast Asia in 1975, nearly 300,000 men, women and children primarily of Hmong descent were killed by Lao communists in their homes or while attempting escape to Thailand (United Nations, 2000). Aggression against Hmong by the PathetLao regime continues and is now supported by Vietnamese troops, in what has been described as ""ethnic cleansing"" (United Nations, 2000). Hmong have since resettled throughout the world as political refu gees. According to Census 2000 figures, approximately 169,428 Hmong now live within the United States, though other estimates have placed the figure closer to 300,000 (Hmong National Development, Inc., 2000). Currently, the U.S. Census estimates that between 962 and 1,126 Hmong-Americans live in Orange County, CA (U.S. Census, 2000), though this figure is also likely an undercount. Results From the Hmong Health Survey 2   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Hmong Health in the United States Peer review literature on the health of Hmong in the United States is relatively undeveloped. There have  been few studies on the prevalence or incidence of specific diseases, health outcomes, and behavioral  risk factors among this population,  which may be due in part to the rela  tively small number of Hmong-Ameri  cans, unique cultural and linguistic  features that impede scientific study,  and their recent arrival to the United  States.  Lifestyle factors, and their associated  chronic diseases, may be of primary  importance to understanding Hmong  health in the United States. Among the  most important of these changes are  those of a dietary nature. Traditionally,  the daily meal pattern of Hmong con  sisted of three meals plus snacks,  heavy use of rice, use of various veg  etables, and modest quantities of fish  and meats. However, younger Hmong-  Americans are increasingly consuming  Hmong Americans pick up tips at a health fair booth. fast foods high in cholesterol and fat.  Dietary acculturation among the Hmong in  America may be linked to an increased occurrence of obesity, particularly among Hmong youth (Himes et  al, 1992; Story and Harris, 1989). Such acculturation may increase risk for a variety of chronic diseases,  including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular  disease, was almost 3 times as high among Hmong boys, and one and a half times as high in girls,  compared to their respective African-American and White counterparts (Munger et al, 1991).  A study of cancer incidence rates among the Hmong of Central California was conducted using Cancer  Registry of Central California data from 1987 to 1994. The study suggested Hmong-Americans might  suffer elevated rates of cervical, nasopharyngeal, stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancers, as well as  leukemias and non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas, compared to all other race/ethnicities combined (Mills and  Yang, 1997). However, Hmong in Central California had lower rates of breast, prostate, and colorectal  cancers (Mills and Yang, 1997). The study also found higher rates of advanced stage disease upon  diagnosis among Hmong-Americans for a number of cancers. The authors suggested such phenomena  may be due to sociocultural impediments to healthcare access and utilization, including an aversion to  Western healthcare and low participation in cancer screening (Mills and Yang, 1997). Consistent with this  notion is research suggesting only 30% of Hmong women 20 and older living in Fresno, Long Beach,  Orange County, and San Diego have ever had a mammogram (Tanjasiri et al, 2001). By comparison,  among California women 18 and older, approximately 67% of Whites, 67% of African-Americans, and  47% of Latinas report ever having had a mammogram (CDC, 2000). Some studies have reported that  Hmong-American women may be deterred in having gynecological and breast examinations by aversions  to being touched by healthcare workers (Spring et al, 1995).   3  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Maternal and child health issues have also been studied among Hmong-Americans. Though Hmong children may be of lower birthweight than White, non-Hispanic children, Hmong children born in California from 1985 to 1988 were not statistically different from White, non-Hispanic children in terms of proportion with low-birthweight (Helsel et al, 1992). Hmong-American women in California may have higher parity (number of lifetime full-term births) and may be more likely to have children at younger (< 18 years of age) and older (> 40 years of age) ages than Whites (Helsel et al, 1992). Hmong-American women may also be much less likely to have Caesarean sections than White, non-Hispanic women regardless of age and parity (Helsel et al, 1992). It has been suggested that relatively few Hmong-American women may be engaging in breast-feeding (Jambunathan and Stewart, 1995; Tuttle and Dewey, 1994). Studies have suggested high rates of Hepatitis B (Gjerdingen and Lor, 1997; Catanzaro and Moser, 1982) and tuberculosis (Catanzaro and Moser, 1982) infection among Hmong in America. Emotional disorders related to familial and cultural separation, feelings of survivor's guilt, and post-traumatic stress disorder may serve as a hidden source of chronic morbidity among the Hmong (Mouanoutoua and Brown, 1995). Given manifestations of chronic disease and increases in harmful behavioral risk factors among Hmong Americans, health care access and utilization issues are of paramount importance within this population. Moreover, considering the poverty, lack of education, and linguistic isolation found among HmongAmericans (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001; True and Guillermo, 1996), the potential for problems related to health care access and utilization are substantial.  Results From the Hmong Health Survey  4   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This section summarizes the primary findings of the Hmong Health Survey. Results are divided into six sections: Demographic Characteristics, Health Status and Behaviors, Traditional Hmong Medicine, Use of Western Medicine, Ethnic and Linguistic Features of Physicians, and Awareness and Attitudes Regarding County Health Services. Methods employed in this report are reported in Appendix A.  Demographic Characteristics Table 1 shows demographic characteristics of survey respondents. Among those surveyed, there were slightly more males (58%) than fe males (42%). The mean age of respondents was 49 years. The majority of respondents were between forty and fifty-nine years of age (49%), while 23% were sixty years of age or older, and 28% were thirty-nine or younger. Among those who responded, 81% said they were married, 18% were widowed, and no respondents reported being single or divorced. Geographically, the Hmong community in Orange County is focused in the center of the region. Overall, 60% of those surveyed lived in Santa Ana or Fountain Valley. An extended Hmong family when they first arrived in Orange County. More specifically, 41% of those surveyed lived in  the city of Santa Ana within the 92703 and 92704  zip codes. An additional 25% of those surveyed lived within Garden Grove or Westminster. Lower pro-  portions of respondents lived within the areas of Anaheim (8%), Huntington Beach (6%), and Placentia (2%).

No subjects were born in the United States. As seen in Figure 1, the vast majority (76%) of Hmong respondents reported arriving in the United States between 1975 and 1984, with only 24% arriving after 1984. A particularly large proportion (41%) of respondents reported arriving during 1979 or 1980. Approximately a third (34%) of those surveyed reported having no formal education in the United States, while 76% reported four or fewer years of education in the U.S. Among those surveyed, 30% said they never went to school in their native country. Only 12% of respondents attended 12 or more years of school in their country of origin.  FIGURE 1. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting categories of year of arrival in the United States (n = 104).  Health Status and Behaviors Among those who responded to a question regarding self-rated health, 14% described their health as excellent, 33% reported being in good health, 9% considered themselves in fair health, while 9% reported their health was poor (Table 2). Interestingly, 21% of respondents said they did not know their health status, and 14% refused to answer. Women were 30% more likely to report poor/fair health as men, though this difference was not statistically significant. Those reporting per ceived barriers to healthcare were 70% more likely than those without barriers to report poor/fair health. Those having a regular doctor were 80% more likely to report poor/fair health than those without a regular doctor. Respondents using shamans were 20% more likely than those not using shamans to report poor/fair health.

Those having insurance were 40% less likely to report poor/fair health than those without insurance. Only those associations between selfreported poor/fair health with herbal remedy use and health promotion behavior approached statistical significance. Risk estimates and confidence intervals can be found in Appendix B. Respondents were also asked which preventive health behaviors they engaged in (Table 2). Thirty-six percent of respondents claimed to do no preventive health mainte nance. Almost a third of subjects (28%) stated they exercised to maintain health and approximately 26% identified diet as a means by which they stay healthy. Small percentages of respondents reported utilizing traditional (3%) and Western medicine (3%) for health maintenance. About 13% of respondents reported they did not know what they did to maintain health. Women were 50% more likely to report not participating in health promotion behaviors than men. Those Hmong-American respondents reporting barriers to healthcare were 70% more likely than those without perceived barriers to report doing nothing to maintain health. Those who reported having insurance were 40% less likely to report nonparticipation in health promotion behaviors than were those without insurance. None of these differences approached statistical significance. Risk estimates and confidence intervals can be found in Appendix B.  Traditional Hmong Medicine Many Hmong-Americans believe illness can be caused by both natural and supernatural phenomena (Henry, 1999). 7 Results From the Hmong Health Survey A Hmong American shaman about to begin a ritual ceremony.   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County Hmong spiritual healers, called ""shamans,"" perform ceremonies to invoke assistance from the spirit world in treating illness. Shaman might be requested by the ill and are sometimes used in conjunction with Western medicine. Many Hmong in the United States use herbs for medicinal treatments. Treatments may include ingestion or application of herbal preparations, abdominal massage, herbal body massage, cupping, coin rubbing, and treatment with boiled eggs. Some ethno-pharmacologic research suggests a high proportion (92 percent) of plants used medicinally by the Hmong have biochemical properties that make them potentially effective by Western biomedical criteria (Spring, 1989), though it should be noted that their safety and effectiveness have not been formally evaluated. Consequently, Western medicine is sometimes considered only after traditional means of healing have proven ineffective, which may delay use of those medical treatments with the highest probability of success. In the Hmong Health Survey, respondents were asked if they consulted Hmong shaman (Figure 2). Approximately 41% (43 subjects) of respondents refused to answer this item. Of those 62 (59%) sub jects who responded, 44% reported consulting a shaman.  FIGURE 2. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting shaman consultation (n = 105). Of those 27 reporting consultation with Hmong shaman, 20 (74%) reported they see a shaman when ill. Fifteen respondents (55%) said that they might see a Shaman after having a bad dream or when they feel inhabited by a bad spirit. Use of medicinal herbs appears prevalent among those Hmong surveyed (Figure 3). Over half (58%) of respondents reported use of Hmong and/or Chinese herbal remedies. Approximately 8 percent of subjects used non-herbal traditional Hmong techniques, such as coin rubbing, cupping, and punching.  Results From the Hmong Health Survey  8   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County  FIGURE 3. Percentage of Hmong Health Survey respondents reporting use of medicinal herbs (n = 105). Subjects reported using traditional medicinal remedies for a variety of symptoms, including fevers, body pain, headache, and colds. Approximately one out of ten respondents reported using traditional medici nal methods for all types of illnesses.  Use of Western Medicine Table 3 shows subject response to items regarding Western medical care. Of those Hmong-Americans surveyed, 33% were uninsured while an additional 28% were insured through Medicare, Medi-Cal, or Healthy Families. Only 35% reported having private medical insurance. Comparatively speaking, ap proximately 7% of Whites in Orange County are without insurance coverage (California Health Interview Survey, 2001). Almost all (90%) of those surveyed reported seeking medical care from private physi cians. However, only 45% said they have a regular doctor. Three persons said they did not know if they had a regular physician. Twenty-one percent visited their physician on a monthly basis, while one in four respondents reported going to the doctor once a year, and 29% of those surveyed said they visited their physician only when they were ill.  Ethnic and Linguistic Features of Physicians Due in part to the relatively recent arrival of Hmong to the United States and translation complexities, it is estimated that approximately 61% of Hmong-American households are linguistically isolated (President's Advisory Commission on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 2001). The U.S. Census Bureau defines linguistic isolation as ""a household in which no person age 14 or over speaks only English and no person age 14 or over who speaks a language other than English speaks English `very well' (U.S. Cen sus Bureau, 2000)."" Language barriers can make healthcare communication difficult and, at times, impossible. Adequate interpretation of the Hmong or Lao languages is often rare and inadequate inter pretation can itself lead to misunderstandings and subsequent mistreatment. Some Hmong-American parents may be forced to depend on teenagers or older children (Westermeyer and Her, 1996) for inter pretation. Often there is an absence of direct Hmong/English translation for medical terminology, neces sitating indirect approximations of actual meaning (Johnson, 2002).  9  Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County TABLE 3.

The majority (67%) of respondents see doctors of Asian ancestry, with the most common physi cian ancestry being Thai (39%). However, among those who see a doctor, 90% said the physician does not speak their language. Approximately 7% of those surveyed said their doctor provides translation services all of the time, 47% reported these services were provided some of the time, and 45% reported translation was never provided by their physician. Among respondents, 26% reported bringing a transla tor every time and another 48% bring a translator some of the time, while 24% never bring a translator. Respondents were also asked if they encountered barriers in seeing a doctor. Only 12 (11%) subjects claimed to have encountered such barriers. Twenty-six (25%) respondents did not answer this item.  Awareness and Attitudes Regarding County Health Services Table 5 summarizes awareness and attitudes of Hmong-American survey respondents towards Orange County medical services. Among those that responded, only 21% said they were aware of free or low cost medical services for low-income families. Such awareness did not vary significantly by insurance status. The overwhelming majority of respondents (83%) said they are interested in health services provided by the County of Orange Health Care Agency. However, only ten percent said that they wanted more information on specific health topics, while 78% responded ""Don't Know"" when asked if they wanted such information.

Two percent mentioned Khmu, which is a highlander ethnic language in Laos, while seven percent would like to see health informa tion written in English. When asked in which settings they would like to receive healthcare informa tion, 91% mentioned their home, 69% noted commu nity centers, and 23% said a hospital or private clinic setting (Table 5). Literature has also suggested integra tion of Hmong cultural themes of family and equilibrium, or the natural balance of opposites, as well as the use of Hmong folklore may aid in convey ing health messages (Frye, Sharing health information at the Hmong New Year Festival. 1995). 11 Results From the Hmong Health Survey   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County TABLE 5.

Associations between health maintenance behaviors and selfreported health status, which approached statistical significance, may underscore the importance of health promotion in perception of overall wellness. These findings are consistent with literature suggest ing a high potential for increased obesity and associated chronic diseases among Hmong-Americans. Results from education items suggest a low degree of formal schooling, both in terms of education ob tained within the United States and within countries of origin. Approximately a third of respondents had no education from U.S. institutions, and a third reported having no education within their homeland. Many respondents told the interviewer their U.S. education consisted largely of English as a Second Language (ESL) classes. This lack of education may be impeding employment in occupations that offer health insurance benefits. Over a quarter of respondents reported consulting a Hmong shaman though a substantial proportion of those surveyed refused to answer this item. One possible explanation for this item's low response rate is that many Hmong are hesitant to admit they take part in such practices. Over half of respondents reported using Hmong or Chinese herbal medicines, and those who reported using herbal remedies were more likely to report poor/fair health, suggesting that use of herbal remedies may be a front-line treatment Results From the Hmong Health Survey 12   Hmong Healthcare Practices in Orange County among Hmong-Americans in Orange County and/or that herbal remedies are used but may not positively affect health status. These data collectively suggest many Hmong-Americans still subscribe to traditional means of healing and that participation in such practices must be considered when evaluating the health of this population. Approximately a third of respondents reported having no medical insurance, suggesting economic barriers to medical care might be substantial. Open-ended interview responses suggested some Hmong may be restricted from applying for Medi-Cal or Healthy Families programs by occupational and domestic respon sibilities. However, only one in ten respondents reported perceiving barriers to seeing a physician though one in four refused to answer this item. Among barriers mentioned in open-ended interviews were linguis tic problems, economic limitations and logistic issues regarding transportation. Modesty was also a perceived impediment. For example, in Laos, patients are not asked to undress in a doctor's office and, therefore, Hmong in the United States, particularly women, may be reluctant to expose their body or respond to the intimate questions often asked at a doctor's office. Almost all respondents received medical care from private physicians, yet only slightly less than half of those surveyed reported having a regular doctor. Results suggest those Hmong-Americans surveyed may prefer doctors of Asian ethnicity despite the persistence of linguistic barriers. There are some simi larities between the Thai and Laotian languages that facilitate communication between a Hmong patient and a Thai doctor, though such communication remains problematic. Only a small proportion of respon dents have doctors who speak their language, and translation services are inconsistently provided, with half of respondents reporting doctors sometimes or never provide translators. Given these language barriers, many clients are forced to bring their own interpreter, though results show this may also be inconsistent. Four in ten respondents reported they sometimes or never bring their own interpreter. Open-ended interviews suggest the interpreter brought by the patient may be a child or adolescent with little comprehension of medicine or its terminology. Half of those whose physician did not provide inter preting services did not bring a translator themselves, suggesting the potential for serious communication impediments to proper treatment. Results from the Hmong Health Survey also suggest there may be a low level of knowledge among the Hmong community in Orange County regarding county health services though a large majority of respon dents were interested in receiving more information regarding such services. The majority of respondents would prefer to receive materials in the Hmong language though results suggest Lao materials would also be well received by the Hmong community. Almost all of those surveyed said they would like to receive health information at their home, while many also mentioned a preference for community centers. Use of culturally relevant Hmong themes may also aid health communication. Additional research using more rigorous sampling methodologies within the Hmong-American population may be fruitful. Perhaps one day the Orange County Hmong-American community can cross the river of cultural and linguistic barriers to the mainstream western medical techniques that may serve as vital lines in the prevention and treatment of adverse health conditions.

First, a list of Orange County Hmong-Americans belonging to the United Lao Movement, a Hmong community organization, was acquired. Key informants were selected from this list of 119 members, contacted via telephone and asked to participate. Second, with the assistance of other community leaders, a native Hmong-speaking researcher gathered a convenience-sample of Hmong-Americans, recruiting participants through HmongAmerican community centers, churches, and temples in Orange County. The use of a single interviewer eliminated the potential for inter-interviewer biases. In all, one hundred and five Hmong refugees and immigrants agreed to participate. A single native Hmong-speaking researcher conducted interviews between March and September of 1999. Usually the respondent was the head of household. The sur vey/interview contained items on self-rated health, health promotion activities, use of traditional medicine, use of Western medicine, linguistic barriers, medical insurance, and education. Analysis of Hmong Health Survey data was performed using SPSS 10.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Chi-squares, odds ratios, and confidence intervals were calculated using CROSSTABS procedures in SPSS. There are several potential limitations of the current study. Currently, there is no single source from which a sampling frame for the Hmong-American population in Orange County could be derived. Subsequently, the external validity of this study may be questionable. However, given that 105 Hmong-Americans participated and that there are currently an estimated 986 to 1,126 Hmong in Orange County (U.S. Census, 2000), approximately nine to eleven percent of all Hmong-Americans in the county were sur veyed. Selection bias may have existed because it is not known how members of the United Lao Move ment and participants recruited from community centers, churches, and temples differ from HmongAmericans throughout the Orange County. Large degrees of non-response on items regarding Shaman use may indicate reporting bias, resulting in underestimations of adherence to traditional medical prac tices. Also, data on income were not collected making it difficult to assess the intervening effect of socio economic status on healthcare phenomenon among Hmong-Americans. Finally, the study was con ducted in a cross sectional manner, making the temporality of associations derived from Hmong Health Survey data unclear. Measures of point estimates and measures of association may also be unstable due to the small sample size.

Overview of the Child Fatality Data for 1998  A total of 1,057 fatalities among resident children under age 18 were recorded on Tennessee death  certificates by the Office of Health Statistics and Information, Tennessee Department of Health, in 1998. This represents a fatality rate of 78.0 deaths per 100,000 children (based on the 1997 population figures showing 1,355,319 resident children in Tennessee under age 18).  This report is based on 1,042 of the 1,057 child fatalities reviewed by the child fatality review teams  (CFRT). The report reflects the team' findings after multidisciplinary review of the cause and s circumstances of death. Therefore, the statistics in this report may differ slightly from others based solely on death certificate information.  The manner of death was determined by the CFRT to be natural causes for 73% of the fatalities,  unintentional injuries for 19%, violence-related (homicide or suicide) for 6%, and unknown for 2%. [Figure 1]  Figure 1: Number of Deaths by Manner of Death (All Cases) 800 756  600  400  202 200 64 20 0 Natural Unintentional Injuries Violence Other   The CFRT agreed with the manner of death indicated on the death certificate in 83% of the cases and  determined a different manner of death for 2%. For 14% of the child fatalities, the manner of death was not indicated on the death certificate and was determined by the CFRT.  -1-    The CFRT judged the death certificate to be inadequate or incomplete in 28% of the cases and in 2%  of the cases deemed the investigation into the death to be inadequate.  Fifty-nine percent of child fatalities were children less than one year old, most of whom died of  natural causes, with 20% surviving less than one day after birth. The next largest age category was for children 16-17 years old (12%), most of whom died of unintentional injuries.

The next highest fatality rate was for African-American males under one year of age (1511.8 per 100,000), followed by AfricanAmerican females under one year of age (1435.8 per 100,000). These rates were more than twice the corresponding rates for white males (684.0 per 100,000) and females (567.8 per 100,000) under one year of age. [Table 2]  Past the first year of life, male youth aged 16-17 had the highest fatality rates. Among that age group,  the rates for African-American males were slightly higher than for white males. Overall, the fatality rate per 100,000 for African-American males and females was about one and a half times that of white males and females.

The  highly populated areas of Shelby and Davidson Counties by themselves accounted for 38% of all child fatalities, with 29% of the total in Shelby County alone. Four counties reported between 31 and 43 deaths: Knox (4%), Hamilton (4%), Montgomery (4%), and Rutherford (3%). Five counties reported between 15 and 19 deaths: Sumner (2%), Madison (2%), Wilson (2%), Tipton (1%), and Washington (1%).

Accomplishments of District Child Fatality Review Team  Child fatality review teams are active in all judicial districts of the state. The 33 teams had reviewed  1,042 (99%) of the 1,057 fatalities of Tennessee resident children by February 2000. Department of Health team leaders provide administration and coordination of the teams. Some specific examples of team accomplishments are given below.  District 2, Sullivan County  The child fatality review team has worked to resolve discrepancies on birth and death certificates  resulting in more accurate vital records.  The team has worked with local agencies to increase their understanding of the definition of SIDS  and what constitutes a proper investigation. This will help improve the accuracy of SIDS classification.  District 5, Blount County  The child fatality review team submitted a revision of the child fatality review Act, section V,  paragraph A that would allow the local team access to and subpoena power to obtain all medical records as well as medical records maintained by any state, county, or local agency. If passed, this would result in a more thorough review of child deaths.  District 8, Campbell, Claiborne, Fentress, Scott, and Union Counties  The child fatality review team provided information that contributed to a grant of $50,000 being  awarded to Fentress County to improve 127 Bypass to install traffic lights and rumble rows.  District 9, Loudon, Meigs, Morgan, and Roane Counties  The child fatality review team, concerned about the number of deaths due to extra chromosomes, did  a survey of the entire East Tennessee region to determine if this number was abnormal. The survey concluded that there was nothing out of the ordinary.  The team compiled a list of hospitals that offer bereavement and genetic counseling for families who  are affected by a child' death. s  As a result of action taken by the team, the protocol for Group B Strep testing and prophylactic  treatment of pregnant women was updated in a local OBGYN practice. This has the potential to prevent future infant deaths.  District 1901, Montgomery County  The child fatality review team has worked with personnel at the local hospital to improve the  accuracy of information on birth certificates concerning the use by pregnant women of tobacco, alcohol and other chemical substances.  -9-   District 20, Davidson County  Three members of the child fatality review team, Dr. Suzanne Starling, Dr. Bruce Levy and Louis  Martinez, serve on the State SIDS Task Force, which had its first meeting on May 19, 1998.  As a result of the efforts of the team in response to the death of a child, the Davidson County Health  Department and Board of Education worked together to see that special education school bus drivers and aides were given cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. Health department staff will also provide ongoing recertification training for this group.  District 30, Shelby County  This child fatality review team, chaired by Dr. Mark Bugnitz, has the largest number of deaths to  review in the state. The team reviewed 297 deaths that occurred in 1998.  C. Prevention Issues Back to Sleep Education  In an effort to prevent SIDS deaths, there is a nationwide campaign to position babies on their back to  sleep. The position of the infant upon discovery was not known in 56 (78%) of the SIDS fatalities. Of the remaining SIDS fatalities, 9 (11%) were on their stomach (face down) when discovered, 4 (6%) were found on their back, and 3 (4%) were found in other positions.   Safety Belt and Child Safety Seat Usage  In the 85 cases involving vehicles for which the use of a safety belt or child safety seat was  appropriate, safety restraints were present but not used in 51 cases (60%) of the motor vehicle deaths. Safety restraints were used in 24 (28%) of the cases. There was no safety belt or child safety seat present in 1 additional case. For 10 (12%) of the cases this information was not known.  Traffic Safety Violations  The driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in 18% of the 103 incidents where the child  fatality involved an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle. For 36% of the incidents, speeding or reckless driving was involved; 11% involved some other type of driving violation. For the 25 cases involving some other type of vehicle such as a motorcycle, ATV, or go-cart, the vehicle operator was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in 2 incidents, speeding or reckless driving in 2 cases, and 1 case involved some other type of driving violation.  Helmet Usage  The decedents were reported as not wearing a helmet in 7 (64%) of the 11 incidents in which the child  fatality involved a motorcycle, ATV, or bicycle. For 3 (27%) of the cases, helmet usage was unknown.  -10-   Firearms Firearms were involved in the deaths of 48 children. The manner of death was homicide in 19 deaths (40%), suicide in 20 deaths (42%) and accidental in 9 deaths (19%). The type of firearm involved was a handgun in 26 deaths (54%), a shotgun in 10 deaths (21%), and a rifle in 4 deaths (8%).  Water Safety Of the 15 drowning fatalities that occurred in a natural body of water or a swimming pool, 13 (87%) of the victims were not wearing a flotation device. For the remaining 2 cases, a flotation was deemed not applicable. The largest number of drowning fatalities, 10 children (56%), took place at a lake, river, pond, or creek. The remaining, 5 (28%) were in a swimming pool, 1 in a bathtub, 1 in a fish pond, and 1 in a barnyard trough.  Smoke Alarms In 5 (24%) of the fatal fire and burn incidents, the building did not have a smoke alarm. In 8 (38%) incidents an alarm was present, and in 8 (38%) incidents this information was not known or not applicable. For the incidents in which an alarm was present, the alarm sounded in 3 of the cases, did not sound in 4 cases, and was unknown if sounded in 1 case.  Child Abuse Child abuse or neglect was suspected in 29 (3%) of the 1,042 deaths. There was no prior involvement with Child Protective Services in 15 (52%) of these deaths. This reflects the need for early intervention programs for all at-risk families.  Sexually Transmitted Diseases The natural causes category includes the deaths of 8 children related to sexually transmitted diseases. Four children died from AIDS or complications of HIV infection, and their ages were 15 years, 6 years, 3 years, and one infant that was 3 months old. Of the AIDS/HIV cases, 2 occurred in urban counties and 2 occurred in a rural counties. Four children died from sexually transmitted strains of herpes infection; one was 12 years old, and two were infants under one month of age.  E. Recommendations A statewide meeting of all the child fatality review team coordinators was held on October 19, 1999. The team representatives discussed the third year of child fatality review' progress, issues and concerns. s There were numerous recommendations concerning state as well as more local issues. The overarching state recommendations were as follows: 1. The child fatality review teams continue to recommend legislation that includes language that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) can not be listed on the death certificate as cause of death unless it meets the nationally recognized definition. The definition of SIDS is the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history.  -11-   2. The teams support legislation that creates a graduated driver's license as an effort to reduce the number of teen drivers who die in vehicular crashes. 3. The child fatality review teams made several recommendations regarding firearms. As a result the Commissioner of Health, Dr. Fredia Wadley, will appoint a firearm safety task force.  F. Additional Concerns 1. The availability of smoke detectors for families below the poverty level. 2. The availability of bicycle helmets for children from families below the poverty level. 3. The need to increase awareness of the issue of suicide by children and youth, the recognition of warning signs and how to get at-risk individuals assistance, among ""helping providers"". 4. The continuing frequency with which vital records, birth and death certificates, are not fully completed with accurate information. A chairperson for a task force on accuracy of vital records was appointed.  -12-   Child Fatalities In Tennessee: 1998 I. Causes and Circumstances of Child Fatalities A. Deaths Due to Natural Causes There were 756 deaths due to natural causes among children in 1998, representing 73% of all child fatalities and constituting the largest manner of death category. Of these, 45% resulted from illness, 45% from prematurity, and 10% from SIDS. Each of these is discussed in more detail in later sections of this report. The greatest number of deaths due to natural causes resulted from illness (342) and prematurity (341) . Of the deaths due to prematurity, 141 were 22 weeks gestation or less and 196 were 23 to 37 weeks gestation. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) accounted for 73 of the remaining deaths due to natural causes, and for one fatality, the manner of death was found to be natural but the specific cause was unable to be determined. [Figure 6]  Figure 6: Number of Deaths Due to Natural Causes by Manner of Death  300  342 196  Premature 2337 weeks Premature 22 weeks or less Other  200  100 141 73  0 Illness Prematurity SIDS  -13-   Significant variation occurred in the gender, age, and ethnicity of the children who died due to natural causes. By gender, 52% of the deaths were males, 48% females. The proportion of males was greater than females in every category except prematurity with gestational age of 22 weeks or less. [Figure 7]  Figure 7: Number of Deaths Due to Natural Causes by Gender  200 184 170 158 150 171 Male Female  100  50 39 34  0 Illness Prematurity SIDS  The preponderance of deaths due to natural causes was among children less than one year of age (581), which represents 77% of all natural deaths. Among these deaths, about one-third of the children survived less than one day after birth (28%), almost one-third survived at least one day but less than one month (28%), with about one-fifth surviving at least one month but less than one year (21%).  -14-   The next largest age category of deaths due to natural causes was for children 1-2 years of age (45 fatalities, or 6%). This was true even for deaths due to illness, where there was more age spread than in the other categories which, by their nature, primarily involve infants.

Cancers and diseases of the respiratory system were the next most frequent. [Table 5] The infectious disease category includes the deaths of 8 children related to sexually transmitted diseases. Four children died from AIDS or complications of HIV infection, and their ages were 15 years, 6 years, 3 years, and one infant was three months old. The HIV deaths occurred in two metropolitan counties and two in a rural county. Four children died from herpes infection, between the ages of 8 to 11 days, and the herpes infection was contracted from the mother during the birth process. The diseases of the respiratory system category includes three deaths from complications of asthma.

Deaths Due to Natural Causes: Prematurity In 1998, 341 premature infants died. Of these, 141 (41%) were 22 weeks or less gestational age, 196 (57%) were between 23 and 37 weeks gestational age, and the gestational weeks were not reported for 4 cases. Together, these fatalities represent 45% of all the deaths due to natural causes and 33% of all child fatalities for the year.  -18-   Table 6 shows the fatalities from prematurity for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

[Table 6]  The majority of the extreme prematurity fatalities reported a birthweight of less than 1 pound  (69%), and between 1 and 2 pounds for 28% of the cases, and more than 2 pounds for 2% of these cases. The birth weight was not reported for 2% of the cases. For the 196 fatalities due to prematurity with gestational age between 23 and 37 weeks:  66 (34%) died immediately after birth or within 24 hours, 59 (30%) died between 1 and 6  days after birth, 43 (22%) died between 7 and 28 days after birth, and 28 infants (14%) lived more than 28 days. [Table 6]  The majority of the prematurity fatalities between 23-37 weeks of gestation reported a  birthweight between 1 and 2 pounds (65%). Birthweight was less than 1 pound for 7% of these cases, between 2 and 3 pounds for 17%, between 3 and 5 pounds for 6%, and more than 5 pounds for 4% of these cases.

Deaths Due to Natural Causes: SIDS In 1998, 73 child deaths were reported as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). This represents 10% of the deaths due to natural causes and 7% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 8 shows the SIDS fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups. All of the SIDS fatalities were children less than one year old, 44% were 90 days or younger, and the majority (56%) were more than 90 days old. Of the 73 SIDS fatalities, 9 (12%) were on their stomach (face down) when discovered, 4 (6%) were found on their back, 2 (3%) were found on their side, and 1 in some other position. For the remaining cases, the position on discovery was not known for 56 (77%) of the fatalities, and for 1 case this information was not reported.

Prior involvement of Child Protective Services was reported for 12 cases (16%).  -21-   B. Deaths Due to Unintentional Injury Unintentional injury deaths are those for which the manner of death was determined to be accidental by the CFRT. There were 202 unintentional injury fatalities among children in 1998, representing 19% of all child fatalities. The greatest number of unintentional injury deaths, by far, resulted from vehicular crashes 123 (61%). Fire or burns 21 (10%), drowning 18 (9%), suffocation 16 (8%), and firearms 9 (4%), were the next most frequent causes of unintentional injury deaths. [Figure 10]  Figure 10: Number of Unintentional Injury Deaths by Cause  123 120  100  80  60  40  20 9  18  21 16 11 4  0 Firearm Drowning Vehicular Suffocation Fire/Burn Poison/Overdose Other  -22-   Significant variation occurred in the gender, age, and ethnicity of the children who died due to unintentional injury. By gender, 65% of the unintentional injury fatalities were males, with the majority of these male fatalities being due to vehicular accidents (56%). Females accounted for 35% of the unintentional fatalities, with 69% of the female accidental deaths being due to vehicular incidents. Overall, the proportion of males was greater than females in every category of unintentional injury deaths.

In the other 2 incidents, the types of vehicles were a bicycle and a train [Table 10]. Four of the child pedestrian fatalities (20%) involved a driver impaired by alcohol or drugs, and none involved speeding or reckless driving or other violations. Among the 103 vehicle-related fatalities involving an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle, the fatally injured child was a passenger in 53% of the incidents, the driver in 29%, and a pedestrian in 18%. When the fatally injured child was a passenger, the age of the driver was 18 or under in 31% of the incidents, age 19-24 in 15%, age 25 or over in 31%, and unknown in 24%. For the 98 incidents in which the fatally injured child was an occupant (driver or passenger) of an automobile, truck, or recreational vehicle, a safety belt (or child safety seat, when applicable) was present but not used in 60% of the incidents. For 12% of the cases, this information was not known. The road conditions were judged normal in 64% of the incidents, wet in 18%, some other condition in 6% of the cases, and the conditions were unknown in 13% of the incidents. Eleven percent involved a driver under the influence of alcohol or drugs. For 37% of the incidents, speeding or reckless driving was involved and 10% involved some other type of driving violation. For the five fatalities involving some other type of vehicle, the vehicle operator was under the influence of alcohol or drugs in two cases, speeding or reckless driving in two cases, and some other type of violation in one case. For the 11 incidents in which the child fatality involved a motorcycle, ATV, or bicycle, 64% of the decedents were not wearing a helmet. In 27% of the incidents, this information was not known. One incident occurred in which a child was hit by a train while standing on the railroad tracks.  -27-   2. Unintentional Injury Deaths: Firearms In 1998, nine children died in firearm accidents. This represents 4% of the unintentional injury deaths and 1% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 11 shows the unintentional firearm fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

In five of these nine incidents, some other person handled the firearm. For the five incidents in which another person handled the firearm, that person' age was between 12 and s 16 years old in two of the incidents, over 18 in two incidents, and the age was unknown in one of these incidents. A handgun was involved in six of the unintentional firearm fatalities, a shotgun in three. In four of the incidents, the child involved was playing with the firearm, in one incident the gun was being used for hunting, in one incident the gun was being unloaded, and in one case the decedent was playing Russian roulette with gang members. In the remaining two incidents, the use of the gun was either unknown or not reported.  -28-   3. Unintentional Injury Deaths: Drowning In 1998, 18 children died from accidental drowning. This accounted for 9% of all unintentional injury deaths and 2% of all child fatalities for the year. Table 12 shows the drowning fatalities for different age, gender, and ethnic groups.

Unintentional Injury Deaths: Other There were 11 other cases of unintentional injury fatalities that did not fall into any of the categories described above. Five deaths were due to trauma to the body: a two-year-old was dragged and crushed by a wagon and team of gentle farm horses; a five-year-old died due to dog bites; a three-year-old injured the head, chest, and abdomen in a fall; a nine-year-old died when a trailer dislodged and fell; and a fourteenyear-old was crushed by several hundred pounds of falling dirt. Four of these deaths were due to head trauma: a six-month-old fell from a couch and hit its head on a table, a nine-year-old fell from a horse and was dragged, a fifteen-year-old fell in a cave, and a seventeen-year-old was injured playing ball. The death of a two-year-old resulted from hyperthermia after the child climbed into a car alone. One infant died due to transection of umbilical cord during a home birth.  -32-   C. Violence Related Deaths Violence related deaths are those for which the manner of death was determined by the CFRT to be either suicide or homicide. There were 64 violence related fatalities among children in 1998, representing 6% of all child fatalities. Of these, 27 (42%) were suicides and 37 (58%) were homicides. [Figure 14] The number of violence related deaths varied by gender, age, and ethnicity. Of the 64 fatalities, 45 (70%) were males and 19 (30%) were females. The largest number of fatalities was for age group 16-17 (31 children; 48%). There were 12 children age 14-15 (19%) and 4 children (6%) less than one year of age. By ethnicity, 40 (63%) of the violence related fatalities were white, 22 (34%) were African-American, and 2 children were Hispanic.

For example, refugees from Cambodia were exposed to          trauma before migrating to the United States because of persecution by          the Khmer Rouge Communists under Pol Pot. During the four years of Pol          Pot’s regime (1975–1979), between 1 and 3 million of the 7          million people in Cambodia died through starvation, disease, or mass executions.          This national trauma, as well as the stressors associated with relocation,          including English language difficulties and cultural conflicts, continues          to affect the emotional health of many Cambodian refugees and other immigrants.                 Somatization          Another important factor related to mental health is culture. Culture shapes          the expression and recognition of psychiatric problems. Western culture          makes a distinction between the mind and body, but many Asian cultures          do not (Lin, 1996). Therefore, it has long been hypothesized that Asians          express more somatic symptoms of distress than white Americans. The influence          of the teachings and philosophies of a Confucian, collectivist tradition          discourages open displays of emotions, in order to maintain social and          familial harmony or to avoid exposure of personal weakness. Mental illness          is highly stigmatizing in many Asian cultures. In these societies, mental          illness reflects poorly on one’s family lineage and can influence          others’ beliefs about how suitable someone is for marriage if he          or she comes from a family with a history of mental illness. Thus, either          consciously or unconsciously, Asians are thought to deny the experience          and expression of emotions. These factors make it more acceptable for          psycho-logical distress to be expressed through the body rather than the          mind (Tseng, 1975; Kleinman, 1977; Nguyen, 1982; Gaw, 1993; Chun et al.,          1996). It has been found that Chinese Americans are more likely to exhibit          somatic complaints of depression than are African Americans or whites          (Chang, 1985), and Chinese Americans with mood disorders exhibit more          somatic symptoms than do white Americans (Hsu & Folstein, 1997).          Hsu and Folstein (1997) and Leff (1988) also suggest that psychological expression          of distress is a relatively recent Western phenomenon, and that physical          expression of psychological distress is normal in many cultures. Others          have argued that somatization is often under the control of display rules          that dictate when, where, and what symptoms are shown (Cheung, 1982).          In this view, it is not so much that Chinese suppress or repress affective          symptoms, but that the context of the situation influences what is presented.          Chinese may display somatic symptoms to mental health workers but show          depressive symptoms to others. Mental health professionals who rely solely          on the standard psychiatric diagnoses used in the United States may not          identify these somatic expressions of distress.          Key Issues for Understanding the Research          Methodology          The history of AA/PI groups reveals the tremendous diversity within the population.          Unfortunately, in the past, research studies have typically classified          Asian and Pacific Islander Americans as belonging to a homogenous ethnic          category. Chapter 1 outlined some of the serious methodological problems          (e.g., the high cost of screening rare populations) that partially explain          why AA/PIs are often lumped together or into an “other” category.          Despite the practical basis for creating a single racial designation for          AA/PIs, using it has had real scientific and policy con-sequences. One          consequence, as demonstrated later in this chapter, is that very little          is known about the rates of mental illness, access to care, quality of          care, and outcomes of treatment for different groups of Asian Americans          and Pacific Islanders. The AA/PI category is a social and political convenience          because the use of the term allows researchers, service providers, and          policymakers to easily describe and discuss groups who seemingly share          similar backgrounds. Unfortunately, this classification masks the social,          cultural, and psychological variations that exist among AA/PI ethnic groups          and constrains analyses of the interethnic differences in mental illness,          help-seeking, and service use. The conclusions drawn from analyses using          AA/PIs as a single racial category may be substantively different than          ones made when specific AA/PI ethnic groups are examined (Uehara et al.,          1994).          A second consequence of using a single ethnic category in research analyses is          that it can lead to the conclusion that AA/PIs are a model minority. On          average, AA/PIs have relatively high levels of educational, occupational,          and economic achievement, and low rates of certain health problems. A          simple interpretation of these types of data has resulted in portrayals          of AA/PIs as extraordinarily successful, which justifies the lack of research          attention and resources allocated to this population. However, recognition          of the diverse ethnic groups that comprise the AA/PI category helps to          cast doubt on the model minority image. It should be noted that occasionally          research on an aggregate group (e.g., Asian Americans) might be appropriate,          particularly when the characteristic under observation is common to many          Asian American groups. Nevertheless, care must be exercised to avoid stereotyping          this population. The needs of specific AA/PI ethnic groups must be considered          in order to fully understand the mental health of Asian Americans and          Pacific Islanders.          Diagnosis          Establishing the rates of psychiatric disorders among AA/PIs is important in          determining the need for mental health care in this population. As mentioned          earlier, a common standard in setting the criteria for different mental          disorders is the American Psychiatric Association’s (APA)  Diagnostic          and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders  (1994). A critical          issue is whether or not AA/PIs manifest symptoms similar to those found          in Western societies as defined by the DSM–IV. Marsella and colleagues          (1985) note that there is a tendency in the mental health field to overlook          cultural variations in the expression of mental disorder when developing          nosological categories. Groups vary in how they define such constructs          as “distress,” “normality,” and “abnormality.”          These variations affect definitions of mental health and mental illness,          expressions of psychopathology, and coping mechanisms (Marsella, 1982).                 In addition, ethnic and cultural groups may have unique ways of expressing distress.          As discussed later, neurasthenia, a condition often characterized by fatigue,          weakness, poor concentration, memory loss, irritability, aches and pains,          and sleep disturbances, is recognized in China. It is an official category          in the International Classification of Diseases (Version 10) but not in          the DSM–IV. Neurasthenia is a common diagnosis in China (Yamamoto,          1992), although it is not an official category in the DSM–IV. It          is sometimes classified as undifferentiated somatoform disorder (if symptoms          last at least six months) or as a rheumatological disorder. Some of the          symptoms found in neurasthenia (loss of energy, inability to concentrate,          sleep disturbances, etc.) overlap with those in depressive disorders.          However, in neurasthenia, the somatic symptoms rather than depressed moods          are critical, and any depressive symptoms are not sufficiently persistent          and severe to warrant a diagnosis of a mood disorder.          Acculturation          An important factor in understanding the symptom expression, rates of illness,          and use of services by immigrants and refugees is their  acculturation ,          or adoption of the worldviews and living patterns of a new culture. Asian          Americans differ in how they are integrated with-in the dominant U.S.          culture, how they remain tied to the cultures of their ethnic origins,          or how they are able to negotiate life in multiple cultures. Although          many advances have been made in measuring acculturation, this area of          research still has unresolved conceptual and methodological problems.          Many factors affect the way and extent to which immigrants become involved          in a new culture and remain connected with their earlier heritage. For          example, age at time of immigration, presence of similar immigrants, and          interaction with others from the new environment all influence adaptation.          The influence of acculturation on mental health has not been clearly identified,          in part because of problems with measuring acculturation. Nonetheless,          the level of exposure to and involvement in U.S. culture is important          when examining mental health factors for Asian Americans.          Mental Disorders          Adults          Less is known about the rates of psychiatric disorders using DSM categories for          AA/PIs than for most of the other major ethnic groups. Even when AA/PIs          are included as part of the sample of large-scale studies, it is not often          possible to make estimates of mental disorders for this population. Two          major studies, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) study and the National          Comorbidity Study (NCS), examined the need for mental health care in the          U.S. population. In the 1980s, researchers who were conducting the Epidemiologic          Catchment Area study (Regier et al., 1993) included residents of Baltimore,          St. Louis, Durham, Los Angeles, and New Haven in their sample. English-speaking          Asian Americans, who were classified in a single ethnic category, comprised          less than 2 percent of the total sample ( N =  242). Because          of the limited sample size and the unclear composition of the AA/PI category,          accurate conclusions could not be drawn about this population’s          need for mental health care (Zhang & Snowden, 1999).          While the ECA study was limited to samples from five U.S. cities, the NCS (Kessler          et al., 1994) estimated the rates of psychiatric disorders in a representative          sample of the entire U.S. population. Just as in the ECA study, the NCS          included a small sample of English-speaking Asian Americans and classified          all ethnic groups into a single AA/PI category. Again, the group of Asian          American respondents in the NCS was small, extremely diverse, and not          representative of any particular Asian American subgroup.          The Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological Study (CAPES), was a large-scale          investigation of the prevalence of selected disorders using DSM–IIIR          (APA, 1987) criteria. This study, conducted in 1993 and 1994, examined          rates of depression among more than 1,700 Chinese Americans in Los Angeles          County (Sue et al., 1995; Takeuchi et al., 1998). The CAPES sample was          comprised predominantly of Chinese immigrants; 90 per-cent of the sample          was born outside the United States. Researchers conducted interviews in          Cantonese, Mandarin, and English, and they used a multistage sampling          procedure to select respondents. CAPES was similar in some ways to the          ECA and NCS. Like the ECA, CAPES used one geographic site rather than          a national sample. To measure depression, CAPES used the Composite International          Diagnostic Interview Schedule—the University of Michigan version          (UM–CIDI)—which is similar to the diagnostic instrument used          in the NCS.          CAPES results showed that Chinese Americans had moderate levels of depressive          disorders (Table 5–1). About 7 percent of the respondents reported          experiencing depression in their lifetimes, and a little over 3 percent          had been depressed during the past year. These rates were lower than those          found in the NCS (Kessler et al., 1994). On the other hand, the rate for          dysthymia more nearly matched the NCS estimates. It should be noted that          the rates of lifetime and 12-month depression and dysthymia were very          similar to the prevalence rates found in the Los Angeles site for the          ECA. The implications of these findings are reviewed at the end of the          discussion of other studies using symptom scales.          No study has addressed the rates of mental disorders for Pacific Islander American          ethnic groups.                  Table 5-1 compares data from the Chinese American Psychiatric Epidemiological          Study and the National Comorbidity Survey for the 12-month and lifetime          prevalence of Major Depression and Dysthymia among Chinese Americans and          the general population.          Children and Youth          Very little is known about the mental health needs of the diverse populations          of Asian American and Pacific Islander children and adolescents. No large          studies documenting rates of psychiatric disorders in these youth have          been conducted. However, several studies of symptoms of emotional distress          have been conducted in small group samples of Asian American and Pacific          Islander youth. Most of these studies find few differences between Asian          American and Pacific Islander youth and white youth. For example, Filipino          youth (Edman et al., 1998) and Hawaiian youth (Makini et al., 1996) attending          high schools in Hawaii were found to have rates of depressive symptoms          similar to those of white youth in the same schools. On the other hand,          Chinese immigrant students have reported high rates of anxiety (Sue &          Zane, 1985).          Older Adults          Little information is available on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among          older Asian Americans. Yamamoto and colleagues (1994) found a relatively          low lifetime prevalence of most psychiatric disorders according to DSM–III          (APA, 1980) criteria among a sample ( N =  100) of older Koreans          drawn from the Korean Senior Citizens Association in Los Angeles (Yamamoto          et al., 1994). Researchers also compared older Koreans in Los Angeles          with community epidemiological studies conducted in Korea. The prevalence          of almost all psychiatric disorders was similar for older Koreans in Los          Angeles and those in Korea (Yamamoto et al., 1994).          Four other studies have examined the psychological well-being of older Asian          Americans. These studies are weak from a methodological standpoint because          they involve small, non-random samples and use general measures of distress          rather than measures of psychiatric disorders. Three studies used the          translated version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). A convenience          sample of Japanese American older adults in Los Angeles ( N =  86)          was found to be relatively healthy and not depressed (Iwamasa et al.,          1998). In a sample of older Chinese American adults in Minneapolis–St.          Paul ( N =  45) between the ages of 59 and 89 years, 20 percent were          found to have significant depressive symptoms. A study of older, community-dwelling          Chinese immigrants ( N =  50) in a Northeast urban area revealed          that 18 per-cent of respondents were mildly to severely depressed (Mui,          1996). These rates are similar to those found in other community samples          of older people. Raskin and colleagues (1992) compared Chinese and white          Americans between the ages of 60 and 99 from senior citizen housing complexes,          senior citizen centers, senior citizen clubs at churches, and other community          locations. Chinese Americans reported somatic psychiatric distress similar          to what their white American counter-parts reported. Finally, White and          colleagues (1996) found a 9 percent prevalence for dementia among Japanese          American men living in institutions or in the community in Honolulu, a          rate lower than that for Japanese men in Japan, but similar to that for          other American men in their age group.          In sum, researchers must be cautious about generalizations based on the limited          findings on the mental health of older Asian Americans. Subjects for these          studies are often recruited through Asian American senior organizations;          the extent to which these findings can be generalized to less active older          adults is limited. However, these results do not reveal high rates of          psychopathology among older Asian adults.          Mental Health Problems          Symptoms          Much more is known about mental health problems measured by symptom scales as          opposed to DSM criteria. In these studies, AA/PIs do appear to have an          increased risk for symptoms of depression. Diagnoses of psychiatric disorders          rely both on the presence of symptoms and on additional strict guidelines          about the intensity and duration of symptoms. In studies of depressive          symptoms, individuals are often asked to indicate whether or not they          have specific depressive symptoms and how many days in the past week they          experienced these symptoms. In several studies, Chinese Americans, Japanese          Americans, Filipino Americans, and Korean Americans in Seattle (Kuo, 1984;          Kuo & Tsai, 1986), Korean immigrants in Chicago (Hurh & Kim, 1990),          and Chinese Americans in San Francisco (Ying, 1988) reported more depressive          symptoms than did whites in those cities. One interpretation of the findings          suggests that AA/PIs show high rates of depression, or simply have more          symptoms but not necessarily higher rates of depression. Few studies exist          on the mental health needs of other large ethnic groups such as Indian,          Hmong, and Pacific Islander Americans.          Culture-Bound Syndromes          Even if Asian Americans are not at high risk for a few of the psychiatric disorders          that are common in the United States, they may experience so-called culture-bound          syndromes (APA, 1994). Two such syndromes are neurasthenia and  hwa-byung .                 As described earlier, Chinese societies recognize a disorder called neurasthenia.          In a study of Chinese Americans in Los Angeles, Zheng and his colleagues          (1997) found that nearly 7 percent of a random sample of respondents reported          that they had experienced neurasthenia. The neurasthenic symptoms often          occurred in the absence of symptoms of other disorders, which raises doubt          that neurasthenia is simply another disorder (e.g., depression) in disguise.          Furthermore, more than half of those with this syndrome did not have a          concomitant Western psychiatric diagnosis from the DSM–III–R.          Thus, although Chinese Americans are likely to experience neurasthenia,          mental health professionals using the standard U.S. diagnostic system          may not identify their need for mental health care.          Koreans may experience  hwa-byung , a culture-bound disorder with both somatic          and psychological symptoms.  Hwa-byung , or “suppressed anger          syndrome,” is characterized by sensations of constriction in the          chest, palpitations, sensations of heat, flushing, headache, dysphoria,          anxiety, irritability, and problems with concentration (Lin, 1983; Prince,          1989). A community survey in Los Angeles found that 12 percent of Korean          Americans (total  N =  109), the majority of whom were recent immigrants,          suffered from this disorder (Lin, 1983; Lin et al., 1992); this rate is          higher than that found in Korea (4%) (Min, 1990).          Suicide          Little research is available to shed light on the mental health needs of Asian          Americans, but some information may be obtained by looking at suicide          rates (Table 5-2). It is thought that Asian Americans are generally less          likely to commit suicide than whites. A study by Lester (1994) compared          suicide rates (per 100,000 per year) in the United States for various          groups. Chinese (8.3), Japanese (9.1), and Filipino (3.5) Americans had          lower suicide rates than whites (12.8). However, other sub-groups of Asian          Americans and Pacific Islanders may be at higher risk for suicide. For          example, Native Hawaiian adolescents have a higher risk of suicide than          other adolescents in Hawaii.          Concerns have been raised regarding high rates of suicide among young women who          immigrate to the United States from the Indian subcontinent (Patel &          Gaw, 1996) and among Micronesian adolescents (Rubinstein, 1983), but these          groups have not been well studied. Finally, older Asian American women          have the highest suicide rate of all women over the age of 65 in the United          States (DHHS, 1999). Clearly, more information is needed on suicide among          subgroups of Asian Americans.                      Table 5-2 provides suicide rates for Asian Americans, white Americans,          Native Hawaiian adolescents and non-native Hawaiian adolescents in Hawaii.                 High-Need Populations          Refugees          The mental health needs of a population may be indicated by rates of mental disorders          in the population as a whole, or by the existence of smaller subpopulations          that have a particularly high need for mental health care. The relationship          between poverty, poor health, and mental health is very consistent in          the mental health literature. Given the relative economic status of Asian          Americans and Pacific Islanders, it is not surprising that they are not          present in large numbers among the Nation’s homeless (U.S. Census          Bureau, 1996). Furthermore, they make up less than 1 percent of the national          incarcerated population (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1999). Although          there are inadequate data to draw conclusions about how often Asian American          and Pacific Islander children are exposed to violence, this exposure is          often related to socioeconomic deprivation. Most studies indicate that          Asian Americans are less likely to have substance abuse problems than          are other Americans (Makimoto, 1998). In sum, Asian Americans and Pacific          Islanders are not heavily represented in many of the groups known to have          high need for mental health care. However, many do experience difficulties,          such as the lack of English proficiency, acculturative stress, prejudice,          discrimination, and racial hate crimes, which place them at risk for emotional          and behavioral problems. Southeast Asian refugees, in particular, are          considered to be at high risk.          Many Southeast Asian refugees are at risk for post-traumatic stress disorder          (PTSD) associated with the trauma they experienced before they immigrated          to the United States. Refugees who fled Vietnam after the fall of Saigon          in 1975 were mainly well-educated Vietnamese who were often able to speak          some English and prosper financially. Although subsequent Vietnamese refugees          were less educated and less financially secure, they were able to join          established communities of other Vietnamese in the United States. Cambodians          and Laotians became the second wave of refugees from Indochina. The Cambodians          were survivors of Pol Pot’s holocaust of killing fields. Several          groups of Laotians, including the Mien and Hmong, had cooperated with          American forces and left Laos after the war from fear of retribution.          One-third of the Laotian population had been killed during the war, and          many others fled to escape the devastation.          Studies document high rates of mental disorders among these refugees. A large          community sample of Southeast Asian refugees in the United States (Chung          & Kagawa-Singer, 1993) found that premigration trauma events and refugee          camp experiences were significant predictors of psychological distress          even five years or more after migration. Significant subgroup differences          were also found. Cambodians reported the highest levels of distress, Laotians          were next, then Vietnamese. Studies of Southeast Asian refugees receiving          mental health care uniformly find high rates of PTSD. One study found          70 percent met diagnostic criterion for the disorder, with Mien from the          highlands of Laos and Cambodians having the highest rates (Kinzie et al.,          1990; Carlson & Rosser-Hogan, 1991; Moore & Boehnlein, 1991).                 Another study examined the mental health of 404 Southeast Asian refugees during          an initial clinical evaluation of patients seen for psychiatric assessment          at a Southeast Asian mental health clinic in Minnesota. The sample was          Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian, and Vietnamese. Clinical diagnoses were made          according to DSM–III by two psychiatrists, who also used information          from a symptom checklist. In this sample, 73 per-cent had major depression,          14 percent had post-traumatic stress disorder, and 6 percent had anxiety          and somatoform disorders (Kroll et al., 1989). Blair (2000) found that          a random, community sample of Cambodian adults ( N = 124) had high          rates of trauma-related stress and depression. This study, which used          a standard diagnostic interview, found that 45 percent had PTSD, and 81          per-cent experienced five or more symptoms. Furthermore, 51 percent suffered          from depression. Most of these individuals (85%) had experienced horrible          traumas prior to immigrating to the United States, including starvation,          torture, and losing family members to the war. On aver-age, individuals          in the sample experienced 20 war traumas (Blair, 2000). Similarly, 168          adults, recruited from a community of resettled Cambodian refugees in          Massachusetts, were interviewed for a study of trauma, physical and emotional          health, and functioning. Of the 161 participants who had ever had children,          70 parents (43%) reported the death of between 1 and 6 of their children.          Child loss was positively associated with health-related concerns, a variety          of somatic symptoms, and culture-bound conditions of emotional distress          such as “a deep worrying sadness not visible to others” (Caspi          et al., 1998).          Some subgroups of Vietnamese refugees may also be at high risk for mental health          problems. Hinton and colleagues (1997) compared Vietnamese and Chinese          refugees from Vietnam 6 months after their arrival in the United States          and 12 to 18 months later. The ethnic Vietnamese had higher depression          at the second assessment than did the Chinese immigrants.          Two studies have found high rates of distress among refugee youth. Cambodian          high school students had symptoms of PTSD and mild, but prolonged, depressive          symptoms (Kinzie et al. 1986). Researchers also have noted high levels          of anxiety among unaccompanied minors, adolescents, and young adult refugees          from Vietnam (Felsman et al., 1990). Likewise, in a study of Cambodian          adolescents who survived Pol Pot’s concentration camps, Kinzie and          colleagues (1989) found that nearly half suffered from PTSD, and 41 percent          experienced depression approximately 10 years after this traumatic period.          Clearly, because many Southeast Asian refugees experienced significant          trauma prior to immigration, rates of PTSD and depression are extraordinarily          high among both adult and youth refugees.          Researchers conducting the next generation of studies need not only to derive          accurate estimates of psychopathology among AA/PIs, but also to identify          the specific ways that social and cultural factors influence the expression          of mental disorders among AA/PIs. The results might then prove or disprove          several of the general hypotheses that are currently made about the prevalence          of mental disorders among Asian Americans.                             Box 5–1:  The Plight of Southeast Asian Refugees           A Khmer woman (mid-40’s)              Because of premigration traumas and the adjustment to relocation            in the United States, many Southeast Asian refugees are experiencing            great stress. The following excerpts were elicited in a mental health            interview of a mid-40-year-old, Khmer woman from Cambodia by Rumbaut            (1985).         “I lost my husband, I lost my country, I lost every property/fortune            we owned. And coming over here, I can’t learn to speak English            and the way of life here is different; my mother and oldest son are            very sick; I feel crippled, I can do nothing, I can’t control            what’s going on. I don’t know what I’m going to do            once my public assistance expires. I may feel safe in a way— there            is no war here, no Communist to kill or to torture you—but deep            down inside me, I still don’t feel safe or secure. I feel scared.            I get scared so easily.” (p. 475)                                    The first hypothesis suggests that rates of disorders will be high because          many Asian Americans are immigrants who undergo difficult transitions          in their adjustment to American society, and many have experienced prejudice,          discrimination, and major trauma in their homelands. Indeed, as reported          earlier, studies have found that some Asian American ethnic groups do          have higher symptom scores than whites. A second hypothesis argues that          the rates of mood disorders will be low because Asian Americans, like          Asians in other countries, are likely to express their problems in behavioral          or somatic terms rather than in emotional terms. Available evidence, for          example, does suggest that the rates of mood disorders are low in Taiwan,          Hong Kong, and China (Hwu et al., 1989). A third hypothesis maintains          that the rates of mental disorders will be lowest for recent immigrants          and highest for native-born residents. Low rates of mental disorders have          been found among recent Mexican immigrants, for whom culture may be protective          against mental health problems at first; but these low rates erode over          time as Mexican immigrants acculturate. With Asian Americans, however,          the preliminary evidence suggests that acculturation is directly related          to well-being, at least in the case of Asian American students (Abe &          Zane, 1990; Sue et al., 1996)                                                         Index                                        Next                                                                         Home    |           Contact Us    |           About Us    |           Awards    |           Privacy Statement    |           Site Map    |        E-mail This Page                               U.S. Department of  Health & Human Services        Office of the Surgeon General        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration         For other mental health information visit  http://www.mentalhealth.samhsa.gov/ .

GX067-79-14304975	"Public Health News         May 4, 2000         New Mural Promotes ""Hope and Help"" for Traumatic Brain Injury        Prevention and Care                               SEATTLE, WASHINGTON - The Brain Injury Association of Washington, Public Health, and the Adler Giersch law firm unveiled a new wall mural today in the Denny Regrade area, designed to raise awareness about care and prevention of traumatic brain injury. Famed, local artist David Heck, best known as the painter of the Tower Records mural wall, painted the mural.                                                                      The ""Hope and Help"" Mural by local artist, David Heck                                   The colorful mural, entitled ""Hope and Help"", is located at 333 Taylor Avenue North in Seattle on the southern, exterior wall of the building. It is a dramatic and incisive representation of the sudden transformation that occurs when one suffers a brain injury.         ""This mural's powerful images serve as a reminder to all of us about the importance of preventing brain injuries as well as the hope for good care and support of those who have already sustained them"", said Richard Wilson, Executive Director of the Brain Injury Association of Washington.         Every 15 seconds, someone in the United States sustains a brain injury, with 50,000 people dying each year from this kind of trauma. Moreover, approximately 5.3 million Americans currently live with disabilities resulting from brain injury.          The consequences of brain injuries include short- and/or long-term memory loss, trouble processing information or concentrating, impaired judgment, seizures, muscle spacicity, loss of senses (e.g., vision, smell), and sleep problems, among many others.         For those with brain injury, simple tasks often are no longer simple. Phone numbers, recipes, directions that once sprung readily to mind can no longer be easily recalled.         The risk of traumatic brain injury is highest among adolescents, young adults and those over age 75 years. After one brain injury, the risk for second and third such injuries increases dramatically, often resulting in even more serious consequences including death.         ""The risk of brain injuries can be dramatically reduced by following simple, proven strategies such as wearing helmets and seatbelts and avoiding alcohol use before driving,"" said Dr. Alonzo Plough, Director of Public Health - Seattle & King County.         Some common sense strategies can significantly reduce the risk of brain injury for children and adults alike including:                  Wear a helmet when riding bicycles or motorcycles, skateboarding, and skating;                   Avoid alcohol use before or during driving or water recreation (e.g., swimming);                   Wear seat belts when driving and appropriately secure children in the vehicle;                   Do not keep hand guns at home; or, if you do keep them with  safety locks ; and,                   Modify living environments of seniors to reduce the chance of falls.
