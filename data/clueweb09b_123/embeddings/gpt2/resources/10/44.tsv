GX049-45-11141524	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                 The Annihilation of Custer      No man can know with certainty how Custer's battalion, met its fate, for no member of it survived. From the confused and contradictory accounts of the Indian participants and from the placement of the bodies on the battlefield, the movements of the contending forces can be roughly reconstructed. But the details of the action, together with Custer's intentions and the factors which shaped them, must ever remain a mystery.    Major Reno had expected Custer to follow him into battle. Why Custer instead turned north from Reno's trail may only be surmised. He may not have intended to provide support in the way Reno expected, or he may have intended to but changed his mind when Adjutant Cooke brought word that the Indians were advancing to meet Reno. It may only be surmised, too, what Custer hoped to accomplish by his northward march. Did he plan to fall on the enemy's rear as Reno engaged the front? Or was he still obsessed with the fear that the Sioux would escape and took this means to block their route? Or did he entertain both thoughts? It should be borne in mind that, although warned by his scouts of unexpectedly large numbers of Indians in his front, Custer had not yet seen any part of the great village and knew with certainty no more of its size and location than suggested by the dust clouds toward which he now turned.    Shortly after taking the new direction of march, Custer sent Sgt. Daniel Kanipe back on the trail to find Captain McDougall and tell him to hasten forward with the ammunition mules. After a gallop of a mile or so, the battalion paused while Custer rode to the crest of the bluff. Tepees carpeted the valley below—it was his first view of the Indian village—and Reno was probably just going into action. Resuming the march, the column started down a long ravine emptying into Medicine Tail Coulee. During the descent, Custer summoned his orderly, Giovanni Martini, and sent him with another message for Benteen. Adjutant Cooke scrawled it on a page torn from his memorandum book: ""Benteen. Come on. Big Village. Be Quick. Bring packs.W.W. Cooke. P.S. Bring pacs.""    As Martini galloped back up the trail, he saw the battalion turn toward the river. Martini's glimpse is history's last view of Custer and his 215 cavalrymen in life. Whether part or all of them reached the river at the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee is not known. If Custer intended to cross the river, here was a likely place one in fact that would have placed him right in the center of the Indian camp.    But hordes of Sioux warriors under Chief Gall poured across the stream at this ford and, either near the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee or farther back on the slope dividing it from Deep Coulee, collided with the troops. Deflected to the right, the battalion fought successive rearguard actions toward a long ridge to the north. More warriors forded the river behind Gall. Others crossed still farther down. And Crazy Horse started down the valley with another large force, crossed the river, and swept round in a great arc that brought him ultimately to the battle ridge from the north.        Custer's Last Battle.  (click on image for an enlargement in a new window)    Caught in rough terrain unsuited to mounted action and surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, the battalion swiftly disintegrated. The companies seem to have made individual stands, fighting on foot against the waves of Indians that rolled in from every direction. L Company, commanded by Custer's brother-in-law, Lt. James Calhoun, spread over the south end of the battle ridge. Capt. Myles Keogh and Company I were overrun on the east slope of the ridge. On the west, near the river, C and E Companies, under Capt. Thomas W. Custer and Lt. A. E. Smith, slipped into a deep ravine and were crushed. Company F, Capt. George W. Yates, straddled the center of the ridge, And at the north end, where Crazy Horse cut off further retreat, a knot of about 50 men gathered around Custer and his red and blue personal pennant, shot their horses for breastworks, and made their ""last stand.""    The fight probably opened shortly after 4 p.m., just as Reno reached the refuge of the bluffs. Probably by 5 p.m. not a man of Custer's battalion remained alive. (Today white marble headstones dot the battle ridge and its slopes. They show where the cavalrymen fell under the irresistible onslaught of the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. How must be left largely to the imagination.)

Yosemite Planning Page          Chapter I: Purpose and Need    Introduction    History of Cascades Diversion Dam    Cascades Diversion Dam (dam) is located on the main stem of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  in  Yosemite   National   Park  at an elevation of 3,800 feet near the intersection of  El Portal Road  and  Big Oak Flat Road  (figure I-1). Cascades Diversion Dam was constructed in 1917 to divert the flow of the main stem of the  Merced River  into a hydroelectric generating facility. The dam itself consists of “cribs” formed by logs or square timbers spiked together. These cribs were then filled with boulders and rocks and were anchored by concrete facing roughly 18 feet below the crest of the dam. The cribs were sheathed with rough-hewn redwood boards, which are visible during periods of low water. The dam spans 184 feet across, with a crest height of about 17 feet, flanked by 30-foot-high concrete abutments. While in operation, the hydroelectric generating facility provided a maximum output of 2,000 kilowatts [1]  of electricity. The hydroelectric facility was taken off line in 1985 and 1986 because it was deteriorated and outdated. Turbines and other equipment were removed from the powerhouse, and the majority of the penstock was removed.     Some elements of the former hydroelectric generating facility still remain, including abutments that flank the dam, an intake structure, a screenhouse, 300 feet of concrete penstock (which historically conveyed water from the dam to the powerhouse), the powerhouse, and the transmission lines. Today the powerhouse is used as a transfer facility from Pacific Gas and Electric Company transmission lines to National Park Service transmission lines. The dam, abutments, intake structure, and screenhouse remain as they were when decommissioned in 1986.    As part of the decommissioning of the hydroelectric facility, the National Park Service determined that Cascades Diversion Dam and ancillary facilities would be removed. Dam removal was to occur in 1999 but was halted until an approved comprehensive management plan for the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  was completed. A record of decision on the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  and its  Final Environmental Impact Statement  was signed in August 2000 and later revised in November 2000.    Cascades Diversion Dam and intake structure with screens were determined to be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 (NPS 1982). The National Park Service has completed all cultural resource compliance procedures required under the National Historic Preservation Act for removal of the dam and associated features (NPS 1987b). Refer to Chapter VI, Consultation and Coordination, for a history of environmental compliance related to Cascades Diversion Dam.               FIGURE I-1 – PROJECT LOCATION              Purpose Of and Need For the Project    Purpose Of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project    The purpose of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is to remove an unnatural obstruction on the  Merced River  and to restore the river’s natural free-flowing condition. This removal project is consistent with the Wild and Scenic River guidance provided in the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  (Merced River Plan) (NPS 2001a) and will meet the direction of the  Yosemite Valley Plan  (NPS 2000a), which calls for the dam’s removal.    Need For the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project    Cascades Diversion Dam is classified as a high-hazard structure (USBR 1997). It is in unsatisfactory condition due to flood damage sustained in 1997 and to continuing deterioration associated with age. In addition, the dam no longer serves a useful purpose – water is not diverted from the site to generate electricity or for other uses, and the impoundment does not regulate high water. Removal of the existing dam structure is necessary to prevent possible uncontrolled and sudden failure, which could result in a release of impounded water and the deposition of concrete and timber debris, grouted rockfill, and impounded sediment along the downstream channel. Such an occurrence could pose a considerable threat to valued resources (such as aquatic life, scenic vistas, and recreational opportunities), infrastructure ( El Portal   Road , wastewater, telephone, and electrical lines), and human life.    In addition, the National Park Service is entrusted with conserving and restoring park values. This responsibility includes protecting the biological and physical processes that created the park, along with scenic features, natural landscapes, and native plants and wildlife. The removal of the dam would work toward fulfilling this mandate by restoring this segment of the  Merced  River .    Planning Context    Relationship to  Yosemite   National   Park  Plans    Planning in  Yosemite    National Park  takes two different forms: general management planning and implementation planning. General management plans are required for national parks by the National Park and Recreation Act of 1978.    The purpose of a general management plan is to set a “clearly defined direction for resource preservation and visitor use” (NPS 1998) and provide general directions and policies to guide planning and management in the park. The  General Management Plan  is the overall planning document for  Yosemite    National Park .    The Merced River Plan is a general management plan that guides management of the Merced Wild and Scenic Corridor. In designating the Merced River as a Wild and Scenic River, Congress authorized the National Park Service to prepare a management plan for the river by making appropriate revisions to the park’s  General Management Plan  (16 United States Code 1274[a][62]). The Merced River Plan, which amended the  General Management Plan  in certain respects, provides a framework for decision-making on future management actions within the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  corridor. The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project complies with conditions outlined in the Merced River Plan.    Implementation plans, which tier off of the  General Management Plan  and Merced River Plan, focus on “how to implement an activity or project needed to achieve a long-term goal” (NPS 1998). Implementation plans may direct specific projects as well as ongoing management activities or programs, and provide a more extensive level of detail and analysis. The  Yosemite Valley Plan  is an implementation plan that presents a comprehensive management plan for Yosemite Valley. The  Yosemite Valley Plan  guides protection of natural and cultural resources, opportunities for high-quality resource-based visitor experience, reduction of traffic congestion, and effective park operations. The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project would implement an action called for in the  Yosemite Valley Plan .     Regulations and Policies    The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment is written within a complex set of regulations, policies, and approved plans. The project must not only comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, but it must do so within the parameters of other legislation (see Appendix A, Regulations and Policies) that govern land use within  Yosemite   National   Park .    National Park Service Organic Act    In 1916, the Organic Act established the National Park Service in order to “promote and regulate the use of parks…” and defined the purpose of the national parks as “to conserve the scenery and natural and historic objects and wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” This legislation provides overall guidance for the management of  Yosemite   National   Park .     The Prohibition on Impairment of Park Resources and Values    The Organic Act establishes the management responsibilities of the National Park Service. While Congress has given the National Park Service the management discretion to allow certain impacts within parks, that discretion is limited by the statutory requirement that park resources and values be left unimpaired, unless a particular law directly and specifically provides otherwise. This cornerstone of the Organic Act establishes the primary responsibility of the National Park Service. It ensures that park resources and values will continue to exist in a condition that allows the American people to have present and future opportunities to enjoy them. National Park Service  Management Policies 2001  provides additional guidance on impairment of park resources and values.    Management Goals    Management goals identify long-range direction for  Yosemite    National Park . Any proposed project must carefully balance multiple goals, especially in a park as large and complex as  Yosemite   National   Park . This section presents the goals set forth in  Yosemite ’s  General Management Plan , the Merced River Plan, and  Yosemite Valley Plan .     General Management Plan Goals    The  General Management Plan  for  Yosemite    National Park  sets forth five broad goals for management of the park as a whole. These goals include:              Reclaim priceless natural beauty           Allow natural processes to prevail            Promote visitor understanding and enjoyment            Markedly reduce traffic congestion           Reduce crowding      Merced River  Plan Goals    While the Merced River Plan adopts the five broad goals from the  General Management Plan , it also outlines an additional set of goals for management of the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River . The main stem and South Fork of the  Merced River  were designated by Congress in 1987 for protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The National Park Service developed the five goals of the Merced River Plan to further the policy established by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, namely to preserve designated rivers in their free-flowing condition, and protect and enhance the river’s Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The Merced River Plan goals include:              Protect and enhance river-related natural resources           Protect and restore natural hydrological and geomorphic processes           Protect and enhance river-related cultural resources           Provide diverse river-related recreational and educational experiences           Provide appropriate land uses      The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions,  typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The management elements as they relate to Cascades Diversion Dam are discussed in Chapter V, Merced Wild and  Scenic    River . The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7  determination is included in Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    Yosemite Valley  Plan Goals    The  Yosemite Valley Plan  carries forward the goals of the  General Management Plan . In addition, the  Yosemite Valley Plan  identifies four specific purposes of the plan. These include:              Restore, protect, and enhance the resources of  Yosemite  Valley           Provide opportunities for high-quality, resource-based visitor experiences           Reduce traffic congestion           Provide effective park operations, including employee housing, to meet the mission of the National Park Service      The  Yosemite Valley Plan  also identifies criteria for accomplishing the broad goals of the  General Management Plan  in  Yosemite  Valley  and the specific purposes of the  Yosemite Valley Plan . The criteria include:              Protect and enhance natural and cultural resources           Enhance visitor experience           Provide effective operations           Provide appropriate land uses      Issues and Concerns    The following issues were raised during the public scoping process conducted for this project (see Chapter VI, Consultation and Coordination) and by National Park Service staff. These issues are addressed in the analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences. Chapter II, Alternatives includes a description of issues and concerns that are addressed in other park plans as well as those that are beyond the scope of this project.    Natural Resources    Geomorphology/Hydrology    Cascades Diversion Dam has affected the natural flow, sediment deposition, and natural processes of the  Merced River  for over 80 years, altering the shape and nature of the river. The dam, in concert with other facilities, has disrupted the natural river processes and the functional relationship between the river and upland communities. These issues are addressed in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Sedimentation, both during removal and over the long term after dam removal, has the potential to affect (either beneficially or negatively) downstream resources, including riparian habitats, fish and wildlife, swimming holes, beaches, and sandbars. Chapter II, Alternatives, and the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences, address the question of whether to completely remove sediments behind the dam or to let natural river processes prevail. Public comment indicated that the type and percentages of sediment impounded by the dam should be discussed and potential disposal sites disclosed. These issues are addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives and in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Concerns were raised that dam removal would have the potential to increase turbidity and decrease water quality of the  Merced  River , and that the project should include best management practices to avoid or minimize such effects. This issue is addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives and in the natural resources analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Fish, Wildlife, and Plant Habitat    The  Merced River  corridor supports diverse aquatic and riparian habitats for plant and wildlife species. Natural habitats at the dam site have been altered by facilities and decades of human use. Concerns were expressed that dam removal should be designed to improve the environment and  to avoid long-term adverse effects to the  Merced River . Concern was also raised that uncontrolled  dam failure could affect riparian habitat. These issues are addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives, and in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    The upstream impoundment created by the dam may contain species specialized to this slow-moving water environment. Dam removal would alter the existing local ecosystem, returning the area to a more natural state. Concerns were raised that species adapted to the impoundment could be adversely affected by the proposed action. This issue is addressed in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Air Quality    Yosemite   National   Park  is a Class 1 airshed (under the Clean Air Act) and therefore must maintain the highest standard of air quality. Dam-removal-related vehicle trips may temporarily affect local air quality. This issue is addressed in the air quality analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Cultural Resources    Archeological Sites    As home to American Indians for thousands of years, the  Merced  River  corridor is rich with archeological sites, both historic and prehistoric. Prehistoric sites are important for their research value and as a tangible link to the heritage of culturally associated American Indian people. Historic sites can provide information important to understanding past land use and management. Over the years, some of these sites have been eroded by river meandering or covered by river sediments. Facilities along the riverbanks have affected many of these sites. Some historic archeological sites, such as dumps, have been exposed; while these sites have scientific and interpretive value, they also pose environmental and public health hazards. This issue is addressed in the cultural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Ethnographic Resources    Yosemite   National   Park  is part of a living tradition for local American Indian groups. Many places along the river corridor are important for traditional cultural uses and practices, including the gathering of plant materials for food, basketry, and other uses, and the conduct of traditional ceremonies. Many of these places and access to them have been affected by visitor use and park development. Ethnographic resources are addressed in Chapter III, Affected Environment.    Historic Structures and Cultural Landscapes    Historically significant structures and landscapes exist throughout the  Merced River  corridor. Cascades Diversion Dam is a historic structure, but one that restricts the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River . Historic structures and cultural landscapes are addressed in Chapter III, Affected Environment.    Social Resources    Transportation    Cascades Diversion Dam is situated at one of the busiest intersections in the park, at  El Portal Road  and  Big Oak Flat Road . Roadside parking provides informal recreational access to areas used for such activities as sightseeing, photography, and fishing. Measures may be necessary to manage transportation and access during dam removal. Concern was also raised that uncontrolled dam failure could affect  El   Portal Road . These issues are addressed in the transportation analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Scenic Resources    The  Merced River  offers beautiful views of the river itself and of the surrounding landscape. Although unnatural, the dam provides an interesting view of the calm impoundment upstream and the downstream rushing cascades of the gorge. This issue is addressed in the scenic resources analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Recreation    Sightseeing, photography, and nature study are among the recreational activities available within the area of Cascades Diversion Dam. These activities may be temporarily affected during dam removal. Concern was also raised that uncontrolled dam failure could affect downstream recreational uses. These issues are addressed in the recreation analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Other Issues: Planning Processes and Management    Plans and Policies    The Merced River Plan (NPS 2001a) identifies management zoning and management elements specific to the corridor of the  Merced  River . Implementation of the proposed action must conform with adopted goals and elements. This issue is addressed in Chapter V, Merced Wild and  Scenic   River .    Conflicts Between Protection of Natural Landscapes and Cultural Landscapes    The protection of one type of resource can sometimes involve actions that may be detrimental to other resources. For example, removal of Cascades Diversion Dam would affect the historic landscape of  Yosemite  Valley ’s hydroelectric generating facility, but would restore the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River .     Relationship between the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project and the El Portal Road Improvement Project – Cascades Diversion Dam to  Pohono    Bridge    There has been considerable public interest in the possible future realignment of  El Portal Road  between the  El Portal Road/Big Oak Flat Road  intersection and  Pohono   Bridge . The National Park Service intends to remove Cascades Diversion Dam, let natural processes prevail through this reach of the  Merced River , and allow the river to stabilize prior to planning, designing, or implementing any proposed future improvement to this segment of  El   Portal Road . Potential future designs would comply with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as other legislation and park planning documents and would be subject to public input and review. Although the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is completely distinct from this proposed future action, the road improvement project is included in the cumulative impact analysis in this document (see Appendix E, Projects Included in the Cumulative Impact Analysis).    Organization of the Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment    The preferred and alternative plans for removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and the evaluation of potential impacts of these alternatives are integrated in this document and will be referred to collectively as the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment. The contents of this document are as follows:              Chapter I, Purpose and Need – The first chapter includes a discussion of the project’s purpose and need, planning context, relationship to management goals and objectives, and the scope of this environmental assessment.

Courtesy of Lowell National Historical Park.                               48          The Lowell National Historical Park, on the banks of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts, is one of many sites in the United States where the Industrial Revolution produced a new way of life for American women.  In the 1820s, the Boston Association harnessed the power of the Merrimack river and built a series of mills and canals.  By 1850, there were almost six miles of canals, 40 mill buildings, 320,000 spindles, and more than 10,000 workers.  During that period the farmers of the newly settled west surpassed the New England farmers in productivity and the Boston Association tapped into that willing workforce.  ""Mill Girls,"" 18 to 35-year old women from rural farm families, were recruited and brought to Lowell to run spinning machines, looms, and dressers. The girls signed yearly contracts, lived in corporation owned and operated boardinghouses, such as the 1830s Boott corporation boardinghouse block.  These young unmarried women worked 16-hour days, 6 days a week, with mandatory church services on Sunday and were paid once a month, earning $12 to $14 dollars.  After paying $5 for room and board, the women had a disposable income of their own.  The ""Mill Girls"" also formed an early labor organization-Lowell Female Labor Reform Association (LFLRA), and with mill worker Sarah Bagley petitioned the state legislature for a 10-hour workday.  Most of the young women stayed for an average of three years, eventually leaving for marriage, a move west, or a job with better conditions.  The era of the ""Mill Girls"" slowly came to an end in the mid-19th century with the influx of Polish, Irish and other immigrants willing to work for lower wages. Today, the Lowell National Historical Park uses the backdrop of historic mills and factories to interpret the early history of the women and men who worked and lived during America's Industrial Revolution.             The Visitor Center is open year round 9am until 5pm. The Boott Cotton            Mills Museum and Working People Exhibit hours vary by season.

Mr. Pitcairn, state how many years you have been superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.  A.  For nearly 25 years since the last time I came on.   I had charge of the region one or two years before; I have been on the mountain division since 1853.    Q.  State if you please, at what time, as near as you can tell, you became acquainted with the location of what is known as the South Fork dam?  A.  I remember the South Fork dam since 1853, but became interested in it while temporarily in charge of the Pittsburgh Division, in 1862 when it broke.    Q.  You recollect the year the dam broke?  A.  I think it was in 1862.    Q.  Was the dam or reservoir owned at that time by the Pennsylvania Railroad?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  It was known as the Conemaugh feeder of the canal?  A.  I believe so.    Q.  What effect had the water, if any, in 1862 when it broke, on they [sic] valley of the Conemaugh from South Fork dam to Johnstown?  A.  It  damaged the abutments of the South Fork bridge, and I think somewhat damaged No. 6 bridge, and I think somewhat damaged No. 6 bridge, and washed our tracks away slightly; very little damage altogether? [sic]    Q.  Do you recollect what was the swell of the water in height from the dam when it broke?  A.  I couldn't say personally.  The water was very high at South Fork, but dispersed itself.    Q.  Well, comparing that with the flood of water that came from it the last time, was the last flood a much greater volume of water than the other?  A.  I should judge that the flood in the North Fork was higher then the dam breaking in 1862.    Q.  Did the Pennsylvania Railroad Company ever rebuild that dam?  A.  No, sir.    Q.  What became of the property after the dam broke?  A.  It was sold to John Reilly.  He took up the pipe, for the purpose of which he bought it, and sold the pipe.    Q.  What pipe do you allude to?  A.  The pipe that conveyed the water from the dam to Johnstown to the canal.    Q.  That pipe was owned by the state, and put in there?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  It was motal , was it?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  The purpose of that pipe being put there was to get the water out of the reservoir in summer season and fill the canal at Johnstown?  A.  Yes, sir, it was to fill the canal during dry weather    Q.  Do you know to whom Mr. Reilly sold the property?  A.  (H)e sold the property to Mr. Ruff and some other genleman [sic].    Q.  Do you recollect about what time the sale took place?  A.  It was about '78.    Q.  Go on and state now what you did in relation to keeping up your knowledge of the dam; whether you visited it, and if so, the purpose of your visit.  A.  The first information that I had on the matter was on the commencement of the rebuilding of the dam; when it was about nearing completion, there were rumors that the dam leaked.  I called the attention of Mr. Ruff to the subject, visited there a\ [sic] number of times, sent the supervisor and his assistant up there a number of times, went there with the supervisor and assistant, and with Mr. Ruff thoroughly went over the work, and the only point that we were afraid of, was the leaks at the bottom of the dam increasing.     Q.  At this point, let me  ask you if Col. Ruff was a civil engineer and contractor?  A.  He was a contractor; he was not an engineer but from his own evidence, he was better than any engineer.    Q.  Well, he was familiar with construction work, was he?  A.  He had done a great deal of construction work in his time.    Q.  What was the character of it?  Embankment work, railroad work, etc?  Was he reputed to be an expert in his business, and faithful in his duties?  A.  (H)e was a man who had a good reputation as a contractor, as (b)eing good safe work, a thoroughly competent man, and one who enjoyed the confidence of railroad men generally.   Mr. Ruff at that interview, promised to make everything safe, increase the strength of the breast, use horse manure and all the material suggested to him to stop the leaks, and expressed it as his opinion that the leaks did not come from the breast of the dam, but from springs on the west side,  I instructed the supervisor----    Q.  At what point?  A.  Of the division between Altoona and Conemaugh, to see that Mr. Ruff did the work as he promised, to send his assistant up there at least once a week, and to report when it was done He [sic] reported that the work had been done, when I sent the Supervisor to inspect the work, and he reported that it was safe and all right. My engineer, Mr. Holliday, also inspected the work.    Q.  Where is Mr. Holliday now  ?  A.  He is Superintendent of the Lewistown division.    Q.  Do you recollect what rear that was?  A.  That was somewhere about 1881 or 1882.    Q.  Did Mr. Holliday make a report to you in writing, or verbally?  A.  My memory is that Mr. Holliday made it in writing, and I sent this report with other papers to Mr. Ruff.    Q.  Have you a copy of it now in your office?  A.  I have not been able to find it\. [sic]  About that time, Mr. Morrell, General Manager of the Cambria Iron Company, who was with me in sympathy opposed to the rebuilding of the South Fork dam, became a member of the South Fork Club, and as he was a resident of Johnstown, with most of his wealth in that city, and an owner of the Cambria Iron Company, I was thoroughly convinced then that the dam was perfectly safe in every particular, but took the precaution to notify the Agent at South Fork, and also Mr. Wilson, the Superintendent of the Argyle Coal Company, in whose coolness and judgment I had great confidence, to keep a lookout, at the same time, directing the supervisor not to forego any care and precaution in watching the dam.  These parties were so vigilant that they made quite a number of reports to me, which upon investigation were found to be untrue, about the safety of the dam, as for example, the dam was reported unsafe, and when we sent our men there, it was a bridge west of the dam; so that we were continually getting more or less rumors which were always proved to be untrue.    Q.  Do you recollect the persons whom you sent up on different occasions to make examinations of the dam after receiving these reports from Mr. Wilson and others?  A.  Supervisor Fred. Ehrenfeld was the supervisor of that section and the orders were directed to him.  Of course, we understood that he would send his Assistant, the Assistant Supervisors on our division being educated engineers.    Q.  Did they report to you?  A.  They generally reported to me that the dam was all right; that everything was safe.    Q.  Had you at any time after making a personal examination of the dam, and after your interview with col Ruff, any suspicion that the dam could be swept away by an ordinary flood, and do the damage that it did do in May last?  A.  I was thoroughly convince that the dam would ne ver [sic] break from high water, and I considered that the breast of the dam would be strong enough to hold any water.  I have been a good deal over the country back of it until it reached the southern declivity, and I could not imagine where water would come from that could break the dam.  My only fear when the dam was rebuilt was on account of leaks.    Q.  If the dam was to give way at all, from what you saw, it would be because there  were leaks away below the breast of the dam, that might undermine the embankment?  A.  That was my idea; that it would increase the leaks.     Q.  But you never had any fear that the dam would be broken by water running over the top of it?  A.  We never had such damage at those points.  At Lilly where the Little Conemaugh commences, we have a very low bridge, or rather stringers over a small stream, and have had a little trouble with water overflowing there, but never had to the slightest degree such a water as I saw the evidence of, and was reported to be at this time.    Q.  How long have you known Mr. Walkinshaw, the Yard Master at Conemaugh?  A.  Over 25 years, I think.     Q.  Has he been at that point that length of time?  A.  No, he was a freight brakeman, and freight conductor; came up in the tri n [sic] service; but he has been at Conemaugh quite a number of years.    Q.  Do you consider him as a trusty, careful man with any duty given him to perform?  A.  I consider Mr. Walkinshaw a man who could be more trusted than any of our yard masers in looking after the company's interests in a case like this, although he has the consumption and is not very efficient as a yard master, and has not been very able to stand the physical strain.    Q.  I mean his capacity mentally to comprehend and make disposition of trains.  A.  I consider him one of our best men in that regard, and in using good sound judgment.    Q.  You have learned, have you, of the disposition he made of the Mail Train and the two Day Expresses on arrival at Conemaugh?  A.  I have learned where they were placed, and had evidence on the ground of where they were placed.    Q.  Have you learned also, Mr. Pitairn, that the water had washed the tracks out to a considerable extent immediately west of Conemaugh?  A.  Immediately w est [sic] and immediately east.    Q.  That was after the trains we have mentioned had arrived at Conemaugh?  A.  It was washing the tracks west of Conemaugh slightly before the trains arrived, and the Mail train  and the two Day Expresses were stopped at Conemaugh on account of a slide and obstructions immediately east of Conemaugh.     Q.  With that condition of things, and even with the water running over the dam, would it, in yourjudgement, [sic] have been a prudent or imprudent act for Mr.  Walkinshaw to have allowed those two Day Expresses and the Mail to have proceeded east, considering that they  were in a place of safety at Conemaugh?    A.  The passenger trains being at Conemaugh, it would almost have been criminal for the Yard Master at Conemaugh either to attempt to send them east or send them west, if he apprehended that the South Fork dam would give way.    Q.  And even with all the information which he may have had, and which you have learned that he did have as to the water running over the dam, even then, in your judgment, it would have been criminal in him to have ordered the trains east or west?  A.  Either east or west; and from the location and bend of the river at Conemaugh, there was no track, nor any spot on the track more safe than where he put those trains.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, I wish you would state whether you made calculation, as requested by me, of the distance of Conemaugh from the South Fork dam by the course of the Conemaugh itself.  A.  I made a calculation, and raking (?) three miles from South Fork station to South Fork dam, and it is 6.9 miles from SouthFork [sic] station to Conemaugh by rail, the railroad running parlllel [sic] with the river, and the river taking two bends of I should judge a mile around at Mineral Point, and the same at No.6 [sic] bridge east of Conemaugh, making eleven miles and nine tenths in all.    Q.  So that those three trains at Conemaugh were practically about twelve miles from the South Fork dam?  A.  Just about twleve [sic] miles by the Conemaugh river and the South Fork.    Q.  And by yourknowledge [sic] of the winding of the stream and the valleys it passes through, and the volume of water that might be in the dam when it was full, would you, from all you know of it, have had any apprehension that if the dam broke, it would bring such a deluge of water to Conemaugh that it did?  A.  The breaking of the South Fork dam was a perfect revelation to me, and with the many wide places in the valley, and turns to stop the water, that it did the damage that we s w, [sic] and I can only understand it from the theory that there were two or three breaks by the water backing up.    Q.  by the water being backed and arrested two or three times in its course?  A.  Yes, sir, and increasing its velocity by the obstruction.    Q.  Have you read the statement Mr. Trump has given here on that subject?  A.  Yes, sir.     Q.  State, sir, whether you coincide with him or not in the vi ew [sic] he takes.  A.  That is the only theory  I can explain it on.    Q.  Is there any other theory reasonable in itself that can be given as an explanation of that tremendous flood?  A.  I can't imagine any.    Q.  How many years have you known Mr. Dougherty, the Agent at South Fork?  A.  Well, I guess about 26 years.    Q.  Has he been at that point that many years?  A.  No, sir.  He was one of our oldest and best freight conductors, and considered by us a first class railroad man, but when we adopted the color blind test, he was found to be color blind, and we have since endeavored to take care/of [sic] him, but his education being all in the train\   [sic] service, and as we could not use him as a yard master, or anything connected ---  the trains, I appointed him Agent at South Fork, intending to give him a better agency when the opportunity occurred.  I think he has been at South Fork about two years.    Q.  Is he a careful, competent, sober man, and does he enjoy a good reputation as a railroad man?  A.  He is thoroughly sober, very respectable, of first class moral character, and considered by all a man of judgement above the rodinary [sic].     Q.  Have you/read [sic] the statement htat [sic] he has given in reference to this disaster, which we took here at the office?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  After reading it carefully , is there anything you see that man could have done other than he did do to get timely notice to you, and to the people at Conemaugh and Johnstown as to the condition of that dam?  A.  I think he did more than could be expected under the circumstances.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, how is the telegraph service of the Pennsylvania Railroad organized on the west ern [sic] division?  Has it ha [sic] head to it? [sic]  A.  The telegraph service is organized with the Division Operator in charge.    Q.  And who is your division operator?  A.  G. (?) H. Sheaffer.    Q.  You know Mr. Wilson, who is the Superintendent of the Argyle Coal Works at South Fork?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How long have you known him?  A.  I never can count the years; a long time; quite a number of years.    Q.  I wish you would state whether you ever gave Mr. Wilson, or Mr. Dougherty, the Agent at South Fork, instructions to look after the safety of the South Fork dam, and report to you.  A.  Mr. Wilson accompanied me on a trip back of the South Fork dam on the line of a proposed railroad  to reach the Ashtola Lumber Company, and some large coal tracts, and there is where I got my impression that the South Fork dam would never break by a flood of water.  we stopped at the South Fork dam at that time to see low we could get around ------ it with the railroad, and we  talked over the South Fork dam matter, and I made a special request that he watch it carefully and repot [sic] I talked with him in reference to its safety, and in regard to keeping a close watch on it.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, is Mr. Wilson a man of shrewdness as a  business man, an intelligent man, and above the average of man?  A.  Mr. Wilson is a man well up in years, calm, collected, methodical, and away above the average not only in intelligence but as a business man, and more or less a leader in that section of the country.    Q.  Have you read the statement that Mr. Wilson has given us as to what took place on Friday when the dam broke?  A.  I have read his statement.    Q.  From your perusal of it, do you think Mr. Wilson did all he could do to protect the lives and property of people at Conemaugh   and other points along the river to Johnstown?  A.  I think he did all he could do, and more than was expected of a man in his position.    Q.  He was not an officer, nor in any way connected with the Penna. Railroad Company as an employe? [sic]  A.  He was not in any way  connected with the Pennsylvania railroad company, but his coal company delivers coal to the eng--gines [sic]; but he has always manifested a sympathy with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and helped them in every way possible, and we consider him one of our friends in that section of the country.    Q.  The men who were in charge of the Mail Train and  the two Day Expresses, I wish you would state whether those conductors were men of experience, sober, tried men, and trustworthy in the discharge of their as conductors?  A.  They were all considered our best men, efficient men, and all sober men.     Q.  State whether they have been trained as conductors in the service of the Penna. Railroad Company.  A.  They have all served  as apprentices, and been brought up in the passenger department from the bottom.    Q.  The engineers of those trains, were they men whom you felt you could trust with the lives -- of people, and such trains as they had charge of?  A.  The enginemen were among out best men, and we have the rputation [sic] and consdier [sic] our passenger train enginemen the very best in the country.    Q.  In relation to the conductor and enginemen of the Limited that passed Conemaugh that morning and went to South Fork, ad [sic] got over the bridge before the flood came, were they men of experience, and tried, and sober men in the discharge of their duties?  A.  They weremen [sic] of experience and first class men.    Q.  The division foreman who had charge of the watching and the repairing of the track east and west of Conemaugh, were they tried and reliable men whom you could trust, and had trusted?  A.  They were some of our men on that portion of the track who were thoroughly so, as is natural on such a difficult portion of the road.    Q.  Now, you can state as a fact whether commencing at Conemaugh and to the top of the mountain very extraordinary precaut ion [sic] had been taken for years before and down until the time of the flood to insure the safety of that mounti n [sic] tract.  A.  Every precaution had been taken.    Q.  How many years is it since you commenced erecting on your division these telegraph towers to inaugurate that system you have now of running trains and controlling the movement of trains by telegraph through these towers?  A.  Since about 1872.    Q.  Have you foundd [sic] that an efficient way of managing your trains   A.  We find  that it is the safest way that has yet been tried, and about the only was we could move our traffic.    Q.  Who is it, and at what point on the road is he located, that directs the movement of trains, where they are to be stopped and when run past these places.  A.  The block station operators give the clear track when they have a clear block.  The train despatchers, located at Union Station, Pittsburgh, would direct them to be stopped for any unusual purpose.    Q.  He is practically at the head then of the movement of trains on the western division?  A.  The Train Despatchers at Union Station, Pittsburgh, have practically the direct control of all the block stations and movements of trains on the division, under my name.    Q.  And is there such an arrangement here at Union Depot, Pittsburgh, that the despatfher [sic] or despatchers know the location of every freight and passenger train on the division?  A.  They know of the passage of every train, freight, passenger, and extra, at every block station on the division.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, you can st ate [sic] now from your observation what destruction the flood caused the Pennsylvania Railroad Company commencing at South Fork and coming down to Johnstown.  A.  The destruction from South Fork to Johnstown stone bridge was about as complete as could be imagined.  there were several short pieces of track favorably located that were left more or less in tact, but no one who did not personally see the devastation at the outstart  could conceive of such devastation.    Q.   Mr. Pitairn, from your observation, what was the destruction wrought by the flood at Conemaugh?  A.  Most thorough.    Q.  From your observation at  Conemaugh after the flood, you can state whether the water,after [sic] it broke over at thatpoint, [sic] carried the passenger station away.  A.  The flood carried the passenger station away.  The Day Expresses and the Mail Train being west of the passenger station  alongside of a street; the cars were left on the track with the exception of two cars that were washed away, and that was the only spot around there that was left in any kind of order to the south side of the street, where there was a row of houses that were all taken away with the passenger station and with loss of life, so that with the way the volume of water swept over Conemaugh station, and the track these three passenger trains passed, down an embankment of five or six feet into the street of Conemaugh and flooded the town, and the fact that the trains and passenger cars remained where they were, while all the balance of the tracks with the dwellings and property in Conemaugh on the south sid [sic] with the engine house, and with sufficient force to carry the engines out of the house a great distance, shows conclusively that whether by foresight or otherwise, Mr. Walkinshaw put the passenger trains on the safest portion of the line between Johnstown station and east of Conemaugh.    Q.  Were there lives lost that you know of in Conemaugh by the rush of water there?  A.  On the north side of the street and south (of) the railroad and the tracks where the passenger trains were put, there were lives lost, but I am only personally cognizant of the carrying away of the house of Engineer McHugh with his family his wife and two or three children being lost, two of his daughters, the only survivors, being caught by the men at the woolen mill west of Conemaugh and saved.    Q.  Where was the round house containing the locomotives situated with reference to these passenger trains?  A.  The round house was on the north side of where these passenger trains were located, and a little east, or about opposite the passenger station.    Q.  What effect had the flood upon the round house, and on the engines?  What number of engines were in there as near as you can tell?  A.  There were over 26 engines, and about all that I could see of the remains of the round house or anything near it, w as [sic] part of the large heavy stone at the center of the turn-table, in fact, that was the only means by which we could locate the round house, after the trouble.    Q.  What became of these engines?  A.  They were carried down three or four hundred feet and over.    Q.  State whether after the trains w ere [sic] put upon the sidings at Conemaugh by Mr. Walkinshaw  , it would have been more safe to have taken those passengers out, in your judgment, and put them in the passenger station, or was it better to let them remain in the cars, considering it was raining very hard and the river rising rapidly?  A.  If the passengers had been put in the station house, or any of the company property, it would have been likel y [sic] that they would all have been lost, unless they had run, as they did from the passenger cars.  Conemaugh is a small village and there are no hotels there, and in my judgment, Mr. Walkinshaw or anybody else would have been highly culpable for ordering these passengers  --------  among whom w ere [sic] women and children out to the hills in this drenching rain, and there was no time for Mr. Walkinshaw or anybody else to arrange with the occupants of private houses to  take them in, and in my judgement, he did the best he could, and if the passengers had remained in the cars, which it is not reasonable to expect with the confusion that existed when the flood was soon to be coming,  they would have been safe.  The Passengers, as I am informed, and know from the evidence, w ere [sic] as thoroughly posted as  any of the crew or Mr. Walkinshaw, and were personally observant of the height of the flood  and of the surrounding circumstances.  The fact that the conductors of the Day Expresses knew, or that Mr. Walkinshaw  knew, and were quienly [sic] in the passenger car  trying to dry their clothing is sufficient evidence that they apprehended no  danger, nor had any reason to.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, what time did you leave Pittsburgh  to go up to look after the destruction that the flood had wrought?  A.  May the 30th being a holiday, I went home about two o'clock and was at my telegraph instrument in my house  until about 11  o'clock, making frequent inquiries in regard to the rain.  On Friday morning, I came to the office on the early train and the Chief Train Despatcher was waiting for me with the reports reports [sic] of the extraordinary flood of water at Lilly.  The reports of this trouble with water at Lilly station kept growing more grave.  The supervisor reported that the dump east of Plane No. 3 was being washed away, and the water rushing down on the south side on the Lilly Branch, where --- there [sic] is no stream, and forcing its way over into Bens Creek, and through the dump which is parallel with the Little Conemaugh; so that Mr. Trump and I consulted about the matter and decided it wise that he sould [sic] get an engine and a passenger car, our Master Carpenter, Assistant Engineer, Chief Operator and as many telegraph line repairmen as we could get(for  [sic] at that time, the report was that the telegraph poles were being washed away), and all the force we could gather up and go to the place of the trouble.  I arranged to take the Pay Car and go on No 18 at 1 o'clock and go to Lilly where we could feed and sleep the men if kept out all of Friday night.  I left Pittsburgh on No. 18, and when I got to Bolivar noticed the Conemaugh river.  I received telegrams at different points that the trouble with the water was getting more serious, and in fact, though I cannot find any message, yet I understood that morning before I started that the people at Johnstown were warned out by Mr. Unger.  I could hardly see how Mr. Unger could warn them out, as he had no telegraph line; and in fact paid but little attention to any reports about the South Fork dam, as  they had bee n [sic] made perhaps nearly every year; in fact, one year the report was that the water was going over the breast of the dam, but whether it was so or not, I cannot remember positively.  That, however, made but little impression upon my mind from the fact that my thoughts were centered on the Lilly trouble, and when I reached Bolivar, and saw the immense body of water, very much higher than I had ever known during my connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad, I attributed it to the North Fork of the Conemaugh river, and as I proceeded and saw the water rising, and at Lockport up to the north track, which I never heard of or saw before, I thought the Stony Creek had assisted in the great rise of water.  At the east end of Sang Hollow middle track about four miles from Johnstown, we were stopped at the block; I went up to the tower to see if we could get any word from Johnstown of what the trouble w as, [sic] and we found that we could not get anybody east, and the operator could not allow us to proceed  from the fact that he had not a clear block.  I was about making up my mind to proceed cautiously, running c arefully, to find the trouble, when in looking east, I saw some debris.  The water before this had been muddy, but very little drift.  The debris attracted my attention from its singular appearance, being broken up wood entirely, and in very small pieces.  In a short time, the telegraph poles commenced to break down, and threatened to take the tower down with it.  The next matter that attracted my attention was a man coming down on some of the debris.  The water must then have been going about 15  miles per hour or over.  Then I say some men and rushed out to see what we could do to save them, but found that nothing could be done.  I then returned to the telegraph office to see what word I could get, when the people came down by the scores; the water rising very rapidly, and men women and children on the drift, and we perfectly helpless.  About that time, I was driven out of the tower; after doing What I could to save people and only succeeding in saving seven out of the hundred and over that had passed us.  We asked them where they came from and they said from Morrellville and Cambria City, and then I was convinced that the trouble was with the Stony Creek water, as we could find no one from the east side of Johnstown.  I then decided to back two freight trains which were there, the water rising and coming up to the track, and went back to the  block station at the west end of Sang Hollow middle siding, when I mad my judgement that it would be running the freight trains into a risk  by backing them, and I decided to wait at the west Sang Hollow block, and watch the progress of the water, and I staid there until we were driven out to that tower by the telegraph poles being broken down, and I went down and staid on the track prepared to get the passengers and run for the hillside.  I then discovered by watching close that the water was on a stand still, and it gradually receded, and I decided to hold the freight trains on Sang Hollow  middle siding, and take all the passengers back to Pittsburgh, giving them the option to stop off at New Florence if they desired to and they could get accommodations there, and take the balance back to Pittsburgh.  It took us some time  to get back to New Florence  on account of the water being on the track.  On reaching New Florence, I went to the block station, wrote a message directed to the editors of all the morning papers, requesting them to call a public meeting of all the citizens of Pittsburgh, from the fact that I had seen enough people go down the river to know that there would be terrible distress.  I kept this message until about 10 or 11 o'clock, when I got word from my supervisor, Mr. W. (H?). Hays, whom I knew was at Johnstown bridge with his work train, notifying me that Johnstown was swept away.  I then sent the message to the Pittsburgh papers, and an order to collect all the men from the western lines, and material to repair the damage, and started for Pittsburgh, being detained at Lockport and different points by little slides and the water over the tracks at low places, reaching Pittsburgh somewhere about 6 o'clock in the morning.  The water when I was going east, at points where the valley was one, two, and three miles wide was thoroughly -- overflown, and that was before the South Fork water came down.    Q.  Where did you see that, Mr. Pitcairn?  A.  I saw that first at Lockport, west of New Florence, and then at Ninevah.  The water at Sang Hollow by what I can see was the South Fork dam flood, from the fact that observing the water at the time, it must have risen about six or eight feet in from  one half to one hour.    Q.  I understand then at these points mention, the flood extended  over the low ground or flats.  You can state in this connection whether the Conemaugh at New Florence  is not a considerable distance from the station, from a half to three quarters of a mile.  A.  The river at New Florence is perhaps from a half to three quarters of a mile off.  The station w as on a high elevation and wasn't touched by the water.  The water extended east and west of New Florence village over the valley.    Q.  The point I want to get from you is the fact that New Florence is about three quarters of a mile from the river where the township road crosses over by a bridge.    A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was that taken before or after the dam broke?  A.  I don't know, but the Bolivar bridge was taken before the dam broke.    Q.  Was that a railroad bridge?  A.  It was an iron township bridge.  It was taken before I got there.  I looked out for it and saw it was gone.  That is, what I understood about the matter, but it is very difficult to see the bridge from the passing train.    Q.  Isn't there a long stretch of  flat country from a few yards west of Florence to Lockport?  A.  From just west of Florence where the river is from a half to three quarters of a mile from the station, to Lockport, where the river is near, it is a wide, low valley, and the houses on the farms and  at the houses in the valley as near as I could  see, the was two or three feet above the foundation.     Q.  So that all that  valley was covered with water to the depth of three or four feet before the dam broke?  A.  Yes, sir.. [sic]    Q.  After you reached Pittsburgh, what measures did you take to place the Pennsylvania Railroad car service at the disposition of people who were disposed to relieve the Johnstown sufferers?  A.  On my arrival  at Pittsburgh on Saturday morning, I got into communication with the General Manager and President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and reported all the facts that I knew, and the fact that I had called this public meeting; and I was notified by Mr. Pugh that my action was appreciated, and to attend the meeting, and if Pittsburgh people could be aroused to subscribe any ways liberally, to subscribe $5000.00 for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and put the whole equipment and men at their service  to secure and transport relief to the Conemaugh valley [sic] sufferers, which I did.  Finding however, that the Mayor had not called the meeting, I sent for some friends  to urge him to call it as soon as possible   The arrangement was to call it at 10 o'clock, but we didn't meet until about noon.  Seeing that the people did not appreciate the magnitude of the disaster, I made them a short address, which seemed to stir them up, and they stopped talking, and subscribed liberally, appointing their committee which met five minutes afterwards, and that afternoon , relief was on its way to Johnstown by trains furnished by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company free.    Q.  Now, Mr. Pitcairn, did you continue from day to day to give the suffering Johnstown people your attention and aid in every way you could, as an officer of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in their distress?  A.  At the meeting, I suggested the name of Mr. James McCrea General Manager of the Pennsylvania Company, feeling that most of the work would have to be done by him, and knowing that I would be consistently occupied for many days thereafter.  The whole Pennsylvania Railroad was put at the disposal of the public to the detriment of their prompt repairing and re-establishing  their own lines.   In fact, the public had full possession of the Pennsylvania Railroad line w est [sic] of Johnstown, and the committee acted with myself in the relief of the people.

Where were you employed at the time of the Johnstown flood?  A.  I was employed at Mineral Point by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.    Q.  What was your position?  A.  Division Foreman.    Q.  What was the extent of your division?  A.  The east end of the division was at the viaduct or just a little west of the viaduct, and the west of the division is where the Johnstown water  dam is.    Q.  What is the length of it?  A.  Two miles and a half.    Q.  What were your duties?  A.  My duty was, so far as I understand it, to see to the repairs of that two miles and a half of track, and if I understand right, was to see that the whole division was kept in good repair, and see that the men discharge their duties as laborers should.    Q.  You had a number of men under you?  A.  I had 11 men at that time.    Q.  I wish you would state what the character of the man was that preceded the breaking of the South Fork dam.  A.  My watchman told me that it rained hard, and very hard, the most part of Thursday night, and I was called out between four and five o'clock, I can't just give the exact time, but it was near five o'clock, on account of a land slide that we had, and it was raining very hard then; it apeard [sic] that an umbrella didn't amount to anything in that rain.  We worked at that slide, with some of the men, I suppose, until half past seven    Q.  Where was that slide?  A.  The slide was about---it [sic] wasn't quite a quarter of a mile east of Mineral Point station.    Q.  What was the extent of it?  A.  It wasn't very much of a slide, but it kept coming all the time, right ahead of the fast passenger trains.    Q.  How many tracks did it obstruct?  A.  Only one.    Q.  What did you do at that point?  A.  We shovelled the dirt off the track, and the water came over the bank there very fast, and we turned the water into a small culvert there, and turned it off.    Q.  Up to that time, had any of the track been washed out?  A.  No, sir, I don't think it had.  Then, I made a trip over my division, and I also had men stationed all along because it was raining very hard, and we were looking for land slides, and we watched very carefully.    Q.  Had you more than that one slide?  A.  No, sir, that was all I had on my division.  At I suppose about ten o'clock, I wouldn't say the exact hour, I was at the east end of my division, just at the viaduct, and just after noon, I couldn't say just what time it was, I made a trip to the west end of my division, although I had men stationed right along, but there had been no track washed out at that time.    Q.  How many years have you lived in that country?  A.  Six years.    Q.  Did you ever see a flood in the Conemaugh before?  A.  No, sir, not like that.    Q.  That isn't what I asked you.  Did you ever see any flood there before?  A.  Oh yes, I have seen floods there before that was high, but nothing like that.    Q.  Would you say that this was an extraordinary flood?  A.  Yes, sir, I would.  I think it became extraordinary after it began to break over, or come from the dam.  The water took a very sudden raise.  It must have raised three feet in an hour and a half.    Q.  At what point?  A.  At Mineral Point.  The fence around my lot reached right on the river bank, and I could tell just how much it was raising by the fence, as there,were [sic] six inch boards in the fence, and six inch cracks between the boards.  It was never p [sic] up to the fence at all before.    Q.  Where were  you when the flood came?  A.  I was at the slide, and I saw  the telegraph poles and wires give a jerk, and I knew something was wrong then, and I started for my house, running as hard as I could.  I have a wife and three children, and I wanted to get them out.    Q.  Did you g et them out?  A.  We staid in the house all the time; the water got up pretty close but didn't take it.

E. J. Unger     Q.  (Col.) Unger, I wish you would state whether you were up at the South Fork dam in the latter part of May, and I wish you would state about what time it commenced to rain, and what was the character of therein?  A.  I was there on Thursday evening; there w as [sic] no rain then, but it was cloudy, and thewater [sic] was very low, but on Firday [sic] morning, when I got up at six o'clock, the valley below me seemed to be all under water, and I couldn't understand what all that meant.    Q.  You slept in a house near the dam, did you?  A.  Yes, sir, 200 yards off.  I got my gum coat and gum boots on and went down, and found it was rising at the rate of about ten inches an hour in the dam, and was pretty well up then; within four or five feet of the top of thebreast [sic] of the dam.  I saw the way it was rising, it wouldn't be very long until it would get full.  I couldn't tell how much water was coming; I came to the conclusion that I would cut an extra waste way, and sent for the Italians and the tools and went right to work.    Q.  How many Italians had you up there?  A.  About 20, but I only put about 13 on this work; they were all I could use.  They were up there engaged in building a sewer.  I sent for them and soon got them to work.    Q.  Which side of the dam?  A.  The west side.  The face of the embankment there was solid ground, and I knew it couldn't wash that out right away.  The people there protested against it; they said ""If you cut that waste weir there, you will ruin the whole business""; and I said, ""It won't matter much; it will be ruined anyhow if I can't get rid of this water.""  I got that cut---    Q.  How deep a ditch was it and how wide?  A.  About six or eight feet wide; and I couldn't just say how deep it was; it got deeper you know when the water commenced to run through.  It left out a big volume of water.  About 8 o'clock our\ [sic] stage went down or half-past eight, and some of them looked at me and asked me how things were, and I told them ""Serious"", and I just staid right there from that time until a quarter past one, doing what I could to relieve the water, but the waste way was full up, and the little waste w% [sic] was also full, and it was running over the top of the embankment for nearly three hours.  I don't know exactly how deep, but it went over the top.  And about a quarter, as near as I can remember, of three, it went out.    Q.  Did it go out all at once, with a burst?  A.  No, sir, just little by little, until it got a headway, and when it got cut through, it just went like a flash.    Q.  How long  was it until the dam was emptied?  A.  Inside of an hour.  That man Parke, as near as I can remember, came up about 11 o'clock to see how we were getting along.    Q.  Who was Parke?  A.  He was our engineer on the water works.  And I told him to go down to South Fork and notify them that there was great danger.    Q.  What time did you send him?  A.  Between 11 and 12 o'clock.  I had my watch in (my) pocket, but didn't look at it.    Q.  He went down, didhe? [sic]  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What  time did he get back?  A.  In the course of an hour.  He reported that he had notifies them.    Q.  Did he say who he had notified?  A.  He didn't mention any names?    Q.  Now, Mr. Unger, was there verything [sic] done that possibly could be done to prevent that dam going ou t? [sic]  A.  Yes, sir, there was.    Q.  Did you think that dam, except for this extraordinary flood, and three hours of water running over it, would have gone at all?  A.  It would not have.    Q.  How high did you ever see the water there before?  The biggest flood you\ever [sic] saw?  A.  Four feet of the top.    Q.  When the water got up, after it had run between two and three hours, could you give us an idea of the thickness of the volume of water that went over the dam?  A.  No, I couldn't.    Q.  Was it one, two, or three feet?  A.  I can't tell.  I didn't measure  it and didn't go near, because it was very dangerous to go in there.    Q.  Do you recollect the flood of last August that flooded Johnstown?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How deep was the water in the dam then?  A.  It was up within four feet of the top.    Q.  Was there any evidence of insecurity about the dam then?  A.  Nothing at all; not in the slightest.    Q.  In all your observation of that dam, did you ever see anything to lead you or any other members of the club to the belief that there was anything unsafe?  A.  Nothing at all; it was considered very safe.  When the bonds were issued for the building of new water works, there was only a few got them, because they were picked right up so soon, and if they hadn't considered the dam safe, they wouldn't have taken them; and another thing, there was an investment of one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy-five  thousand dollars, and if the people considered the dam unsafe, they wouldn't have b een [sic] foolish enough to put their money in there.  The dam was tighter and less water went through than when it was first built.    Q.  How large was this waste weir to take the water off?  A.  75 feet wide.    Q.  On which  side was it?  A.  On the east side.    Q.  And how much lower was that weir than the breast of the dam ?  A.  About eight feet as near as I can tell.    Q.  So that there was ----- [sic] a passage way 75 feet wife [sic] and eight feet deep for a waste wier.  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How high did the water ever get up with reference to that weir.  Did you  ever see it run out of that waste weir?  A.  Yes, sir, it did that time when it flooded Johnstown before, and it discharged all the water.    Q.  So that the time of this last flood, it filled that w aste [sic] weir up to eight feet of the top of the dam, and then for three hours it flowed over the top?  A.  Yes, sir, over the top  and this new  waste way besides, which did great execution as regards relieving the water.    Q.  Do you know whether the dam was ever repaired from time to time by anybody?  A.  It was.    Q.  By whom?  A.  The Club; and Mr. Pitcairn had men up there looking after it.    Q.  Do you know Mr. Ehrenfeld?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was he there?  A.  Yes, sir, he did some repairing; he had some men there to do some work below  the dam; of course, it pertained to the whole business;  and the engineer was there; I don't remember his name; I gave a dinner to the engineer when he was there.    Q.  What time did Col. Ruff die , do you recollect?  A.  I don't remember the time exactly.    Q.  Had he been around there considerably?  A.  Yes, sir, on the day of his death, there was a wagon load of fruit trees came up for his cottage at the lake.    Q.  Did he die suddenly?  A.  He did.    Q.  Col. Ruff was a contractor and engineer, I believe?  A.  I don't know in regard to his engineering qualities; he was a contractor.    Q.  What was the character of his work?  A.  It was considered good.    Q.  What kind, I mean.  A.  He built embankments, and did much work as that dam was; and/ [sic] he built part of the West Penn Railroad.    Q.  Who was it built the dam after it broke away?  Who had charge of the work?  A.  Col. Ruff, and Nathan McDowell.  He assisted Col. Ruff in building it.    Q.  So that you had the benefit of the experience of Col. Ruff as a contractor, and Nathan McDowell as an engineer.  A.  Yes, sir, Nathan was considered the engineer.    Q.  That was after the South Fork Club was organized?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And who work was done and paid for by them?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And the work was done and paid for by the      [sic]  And I on many occasions went around there to see about the leakage, and I found it was less as the dam got older.  When the dam was originally   built, they built it without stopping the water; they put in immense rocks, and the water went through those rocks; your see, as near as I can remember, the embankment was 250 or 300 yards at the bottom, so that they could put in an immense quantity of rocks there, and when they were ready to stop the water, they put hay and spruce boughs in front of it, and that stopped the water right away; I don't know how high it was then, but not very high, and then they went down there with carts, and clay was put in parts of it and ground in other parts; and the water was stopped by this hay and spruce boughs; that made it  tight; that w as [sic] away down at the bottom, and it had a big surface of ground at the bottom.  I don't know how many carts were engaged there, but there were 30 or 40 carts.  The breadth of the breast of the bottom  was  300 feet.    Q.  From one side of the valley to the other, what was the distance?  A.  Nearly 900 feet.      Return to the List of Witnesses"
GX127-09-15860973	Hagerman Fossil     Beds'      CRITTER CORNER       by Dr. Greg McDonald       Monument Paleontologist                 Camels: Not Just Deserts                 When someone mentions camels, what is the first image that comes to mind?     For most people, its a dry hot desert with tall sand dunes. This is not unreasonable when     we think of where the two types of modern camels live. The dromedary (single humped) is     found in the Middle East (including the Sahara Desert) and the Bactrian (double humped)     lives in the arid parts of Asia such as the Gobi Desert. Because of the close association     of modern camels with the desert, most people are not too surprised when they find out we     have fossil camels in southern Idaho. After all, with only 9 inches of precipitation a     year this area is classified as a desert, so why shouldn't a camel be able to survive     here. But the desert we see today didn't exist in southern Idaho 3 million years ago.  Camels     originated in North American about 50 million years ago and their presence in the Old     World is a recent event, geologically speaking. Most of their history is preserved in the     fossil record in North America. Based on this record we know that most camels didn't live     in deserts but were adapted to grasslands and parkland situations. Certainly the camels     that we find in Hagerman Fossil Beds weren't living in a desert The presence of many other     animals such as beaver, otter, muskrat, turtles, frogs and waterfowl indicate extensive     wetlands in the Hagerman area 2 to 3 million years ago when camels roamed here. In fact,     camels probably didn't adapt to desert conditions until after they dispersed into Asia and     the Middle East.        Past evidence for camels and their close relatives, lames, at Hagerman has been scanty.     The few bits and pieces, such as isolated teeth and toe bones didn't tell us much about     these animals except that they were here. However, our knowledge of camels at Hagerman     Fossil Beds took a giant step forward recently with the discovery of a complete skull of     the extinct genus  Camelops , whose name when translated, literally means camel face.      Camelops is known from a number of other places in Idaho, such as American Falls     Reservoir. It is also known from many other localities in the western United States,     including the well known La Brea Tar Pits in California. All of these other sites are from     the younger Pleistocene epoch (known more popularly as the Ice Age). Our newly discovered     skull is certainly a different species from the Ice Age  Camelops . We are not yet     sure which species of  Camelops we have, because specimens preserved from older rocks     are few and far between. This complete skull from the Monument will greatly enhance our     understanding of the early history of  Camelops .        This skull is exciting for another important and totally unexpected reason. It came     from a layer that wasn't supposed to have any bones in it! All previous discoveries of     fossils in the Monument were made in the Glenns Ferry Formation, which is mostly composed     of fine sands, silts and clays. Sitting on top of the Glenns Ferry Formation is a thick     layer of coarse gravel known as the Tuana Gravels. Bones are rarely preserved in coarse     gravels because the tumbling action of the gravel in fast moving water tends to break bone     into small pieces. As it turns out, on top of the gravels is another layer of fine river     channel sands, just right for preserving bone, and it was in this layer that the skull of  Camelops      was found. We don't know for sure the age of our new discovery but because of its     position above the Glenns Ferry Formation we can be sure that it is younger than all the     typical fossils found at the Monument. Perhaps it is as young as 2 million years or maybe     younger. Although our skull of  Camelops  will provide much new information, more     importantly it shows that even after 65 years of research, there is still much more to be     learned about the Monument's fossils and geology.

H. Watt      Q.  Where were you employed at the time of the Johnstown flood?  A.  I was ticket agent at Johnstown.    Q.  How long had you been there?  A.  Since the 11th of March 1889.    Q.  Did you at any time Friday received any warning in relation to the South Fork dam being unsafe?  A.  Well, they did at the station, but I was at home.  I left the station about 8.45 on Friday morning, and had gone home over in town, and didn't get back to the station until Saturday evening.    Q.  You don't know anything about any messages then?  A.  Yes, I do.  I saw a message after I got back, but as to what it was, I don't positively remember.  I knew it was something in relation to the South Fork reservoir being liable to burst at any moment, and to try to warn the people of Johnstown, signed by R. P. , and also a message from the operator at South Fork, but I wasn't there at the time, and I didn't pay a great deal of attention to them afterwards.    Q.  Where were you when the flood came?  A.  I was at home.  My house was on Lincoln Street.    Q.  Was you house flooded?  A.  Yes, sir, we staid on the roof until the worst got past, and then got  back into the attic and remained there until Saturday morning.  Saturday morning, we started out a little hole we cut in the roof, and climbed out through other houses and got up town and got a lunch.  We got down over the river by a boat over to the station, and got over there about four o'clock Saturday evening.    Q.  How high was the water before the dam broke?  A.  I suppose the water was  ten feet deep around our house when the flood broke.    Q.  With reference to the locality of your house and the station house, shove [sic] or   below in Johnstown?  A.  Our house stood a great deal lower than the station,directly [sic] opposite the station.    Q.  Had you a family?  A.  I had my wife and grandmother.    Q.  And there was ten feet of water in that house?  A.  Yes, sir.  Our house is just a new house, and the man that built it put it about six feet above the foundation, and we though the water never would touch it, but we had at least four feet of water on the lower floor before the dam broke.  I waded down stairs at 11 o'clock, and then the water got so high it was coming in over the tops of my gum boots, and it kept  on raising until half-past three, when I know at  the least  calculation, it was four feet deep.  The flood struck us at  4.07.       Return to the List of Witnesses

Where do you reside, sir?  A.  Conemaugh.    Q.  How long have you lived there?  A.  About 28 years.    Q.  Have you seen freshets or floods in the Conemaugh there?  A.  Yes, sir, never one as big as this one though.    Q.  Before the present flood which you have alluded to, when was there a flood prior to it that approached it to any degree?  A.  Oh, I can't recollect.    Q.  Wasn't there one in June two years ago?  A.  Yes, I think there was.    Q.  How much higher do you think this last flood was before the dam broke, then anyone you ev(e)r [sic] saw in the Conemaugh?  A.  Well, it must have been three or four feet higher.    Q.  You never saw such high water as that?  A.  Yes, sir; I know  it never  came around my house before, or near it.    Q.  Where is your house with reference to the station house?  A.  My house is right at the bridge that went across in the yard; we were right in the flat there on the Franklin side of the river, opposite from the station.    Q.  What was you employed in on that day of the flood?  A.  I have been running on that road for a long time; since '55 (?); I was coupled on ahead of the first section of No. 8  to help her up the hill.    Q.  What was your position?  A.  Engineer.    Q.  What was the number of your engine?  A.  437.    Q.  What, if anything, do you know about any warning or telegram being received as to the condition of the South Fork dam?  A.  I don't know anything at all, for my part.  I was on the engine all day  from the time the first section of Day express came up until the water came.  We were laying down below the crossing or bridge, and they pulled the train up on the back track up to the station.  I went over to Capstick, the Round House Foreman, to get some one to watch my engine until I went over to get my wife out.  We got Tom. Sheridan to come out and take the engine until I got my wife on the hill.  Just after I went over, the flood fell a little.  We had taken up the carpet on the parlor floor and got the furniture upstairs, and I went out to see where the water was and where we would go.  My wife is a cripple, and we had to carry her out.  She was walking on crutches.  Well, I went to the river, and just as I got to the river, I heard an engine whistling up above the round house, and I thought there might be some danger.  I ran to my house and told my wife to get out as quick as she could; I said ""Get on my back, and I'll carry you"", and just then Joe Schry, an engineer, came along, and grabbed her and ran out on the street with her, and we got a chair and put her in it, and carried her away as quick as we could.  We just got over the old Portage Railroad when the houses were all going.    Q.  You know Mr. Walkinshaw very well, don't you?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Considering the ehight [sic] of the water, and the way the track was torn up west of Conemaugh, and obstructed and torn up east of it , do you think he could have put those trains in any safer place than he did?  A.  I don't think he could; I don't know what his orders were.     Q.  Suppose there were no orders?  A.  Well, he couldn't have put them in any better position than where he had them.  He moved all the trains to a place where he thought they would be safe.  I was there, and seen him doing that.    Q.  And you think as a prudent, careful man, he did all with those trains any man could do?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Did you see the flood coming?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What did it look like?  A.  It just looked like a great body of high water, as high as a house, 30 feet, full of timber, logs, trees, and everything.    Q.  What became of your train?  A.  The engine that we had, we had cut loose to let a passge [sic] into the station house; and it was washed down near the furnace, about a quarter of a mile, and the other engine was washed off the track, and the train staid there, because the coal scaffold was knocked down and made a big drift right above the trains.  The first and second No. 8's were laying together side by side, and No. 12 was laying over on the south side.  Second No. 8, I believe, took fire that night some way or another.    Q.  Now, except for this extraordinary burst of water from the dam breaking, don't you think those trains were in a perfectly safe place?  A.  I would think they were.  If I had been on the engien [sic] any other place or any other time---I [sic] wasn't on the engien [sic] at that time when it was coming,---if [sic] I had been on the engine, you couldn't have got me off it.  I wouldn't have ever dreamed of anything of that kind taking the engine away.    Q.  What did your engine weigh?  A.  50 tons, I think they count them; 114,000 pounds, I think.    Q.  It carried it a quarter of a mile?  A.  Oh yes.    Q.  How many engines we re [sic] there in the round house?  A.  Some say 33 and some say 23.  They were all scattered around; and there was no engine left on the track at all.    Q.  Did the water that swept over these trains pass over into the town of Conemaugh?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And swept the  houses out?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How many people were drowned living in Conemaugh?  A.  There was 18 drowned in Franklin Borough and I think they counted eight in East Conemaugh, besides the passengers; there were some of them lost.    Q.  Do you remember of the dam brea king [sic] in 1862?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Where wre [sic]  you living when the dam broke in 1862?  A.  Just where I do now.    Q.  What effect had the breaking of the dam on the yard at Conemaugh?  Had it any effect at all?  How much of a swell did it make?  A.  Oh it made the  water pretty high; just a regular high water.    Q.  Was it out of its banks?  A.  It was bank full, but it didn't do any damage at all.    Q.  You recollect the fact that the dam did break in 1862?  A.  Yes, sir, I  recollect it well; I was working for the Company then the same as I am now.    Q.  What time of the year did the dam break?  A.  Well, now, I could hardly tell that.    Q.  Was it in the Spring, Fall, or Summer?  A.  It appears to me it was in the Fall, but I wouldn't be certain about that.    Q.  So far  as you know, did the water from the dam breaking do any damage above Conemaugh and about South Fork?  A.  Not that I know of, no, sir.    Q.  Didn't it take any bridges away or anything of that kind?  A.  No, sir.     Return to the List of Witnesses"
