Species         About 800, see  text         Ficus  is a  genus  of about 850  species  of woody  trees ,  shrubs ,  vines ,  epiphytes , and  hemiepiphyte  in the  family   Moraceae . Collectively known as  fig trees  or  figs , they are native throughout the  tropics  with a few species extending into the semi-warm  temperate  zone. The so-called  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) is a temperate species from the Middle East and eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its  fruit , also referred to as  figs . The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as  bushfood . However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

Take, for example, the  Common Fig , a small temperate deciduous tree whose fingered  fig leaf  is well-known in art and  iconography ; or the  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) a hemi-epiphyte with thin tough leaves on pendulous stalks adapted to its  rain forest  habitat; or the rough-leaved  sandpaper figs  from  Australia ; or the  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ), a vine whose small, hard leaves form a dense carpet of foliage over rocks or garden walls. Moreover, figs with different plant habits have undergone  adaptive radiation  in different  biogeographic  regions, often leading to very high levels of  alpha diversity . In the tropics, it is quite common to find that  Ficus  is the most species-rich plant genus in a particular forest. In Asia as many as 70 or more species can co-exist. [ 1 ]   The specific identification of many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have  aerial roots  and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The fig fruit is an enclosed  inflorescence , sometimes referred to as a  syconium , an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig  pollination  system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, know as  fig wasps  that enter these closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists [ 2 ] . Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish sap ( latex ), some in copious quantities; the twig has paired  stipules  or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as a ""tri-veined"".   Unfortunately, there are no unambiguous older  fossils  of  Ficus . However, current  molecular clock  estimates indicate that  Ficus  is a relatively ancient genus being at least 60 million years old [ 2 ] , and possibly as old as 80 million years. The main radiation of  extant  species, however, may have taken place more recently, between 20 and 40 million years ago.     [ edit ]   Ecology and uses           Coppersmith Barbet  feeding on  White Fig  ( Ficus virens ) fruit       Figs are  keystone species  in many  rainforest   ecosystems . Their fruit are a key resource for some  frugivores  including  fruit bats ,  capuchin monkeys ,  langurs  and  mangabeys . They are even more important for some  birds .  Asian barbets ,  pigeons ,  hornbills ,  fig-parrots  and  bulbuls  are examples of  taxa  which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many  Lepidoptera   caterpillars , for example of several  Euploea  species (Crow butterflies), the  Plain Tiger  ( Danaus chrysippus ), the  Giant Swallowtail  ( Papilio cresphontes ), the  Brown Awl  ( Badamia exclamationis ), and  Chrysodeixis eriosoma ,  Choreutidae  and  Copromorphidae   moths  feed on fig leaves. The  Citrus long-horned beetle  ( Anoplophora chinensis ), for example, has larvae which feed on  wood , including that of fig trees; it can become a  pest  in fig plantations. Similarly, the  Sweet Potato Whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as  potted plants  and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see  List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae) .          Leaves of the  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa )       The wood of fig trees is often soft and the  latex  precludes its use for many purposes. It was used to make  mummy   caskets  in  Ancient Egypt . Certain fig species (mainly  F. cotinifolia ,  F. insipida  and  F. padifolia ) are traditionally used in  Mesoamerica  to produce  papel amate  ( Nahuatl :  matl ).  Mutuba  ( F. natalensis ) is used to produce  barkcloth  in  Uganda .  Pou  ( F. religiosa  leaves' shape inspired one of the standard  kbach rachana , decorative elements in  Cambodian  architecture.  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) and  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ) are identified as powerful air-cleaning plants in the  NASA Clean Air Study .  Indian Banyan  ( F. bengalensis ) and the Indian Rubber Plant, as well as other species, have use in  herbalism . The latter is known to be a  hyperaccumulator  of  benzene  and  methane [ dubious     discuss ] , and urban or potted plants should be considered toxic for that reason.          A page from the  Mexican   Huexotzinco Codex , painted on  matl       Figs have figured prominently in some human cultures. There is evidence that figs, specifically the  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ), were among the first - if not the very first - plant species that were deliberately bred for agriculture in the  Middle East , starting more than 11,000 years ago. Nine  subfossil   F. carica  figs dated to about  9400-9200 BC  were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of  Jericho ). These were a  parthenocarpic  type and thus apparently an early cultivar. This find predates the cultivation of  grain  in the  Middle East  by many hundreds of years. [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Cultural and spiritual significance   Fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the  Sacred Fig  tree ( Peepul, Bodhi, Bo,  or  Po, Ficus religiosa ) and the  Banyan  Fig ( Ficus benghalensis ). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a  Ficus religiosa  tree known as the  Sri Maha Bodhi  planted in the temple at  Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BC. It is one of the two sacred trees of  Islam , and there is a  sura  in Quran named ""The Fig"" or  At-Tin ( ), and in  East Asia , figs are pivotal in  Buddhism ,  Hinduism  and  Jainism .  Siddhrtha Gautama , the Supreme  Buddha , is traditionally held to have found  bodhi  (enlightenment) while meditating under a  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ). The same species was  Ashvastha , the "" world tree "" of Hinduism. The  Plaksa  Pra-sravana  was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the  Sarasvati River  sprang forth; it is usually held to be a Sacred Fig but more probably seems to be a  Wavy-leaved Fig  ( F. infectoria ). The Common Fig tree is cited in the  Bible , where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The fig fruit is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah ( Deut.  8). Other important plants reported included:  wheat , barley,  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  olives , and dates (representing the honey). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit ( Mark 11:12-14 ).     [ edit ]   Fig pollination and fig fruit     See also:  Common Fig            A  Common Fig   syconium  (fruit)       Many are grown for their fruits, though only  Ficus carica  is cultivated to any extent for this purpose. Furthermore, the fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergens, and the sap is a serious eye irritant. The fig is commonly thought of as fruit, but it is properly the flower of the fig tree. It is in fact a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus  Dorstenia , also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.

Source:  USDA Nutrient database       A fig ""fruit"" is derived from a specially adapted type of  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers). In this case, it is an involuted, nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the  inner  surface. Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open. In  Chinese  the fig is called  w hu gu  ) Traditional Chinese :   ;  Simplified Chinese :   ; ), ""fruit without flower"" [ 4 ] . In  Bengali , where the Common Fig is called  dumur , it is referenced in a proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele  (""You have become [invisible like] the  dumur  flower"").   The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the  ostiole ) at the outward end that allows access to  pollinators . The flowers are pollinated by  very small wasps  that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be one of the many tiny mature, seed-bearing flowers found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, the flowers will appear as fleshy ""threads"", each bearing a single seed inside.   The fig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (hermaphrodite and female): [ 5 ]     All the native fig trees of the American continent are hermaphrodites, as well as species like  Indian Banyan  ( F. benghalensis ),  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ),  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ),  Fiddle-leaved Fig  ( F. lyrata ),  Moreton Bay Fig  ( F. macrophylla ),  Chinese Banyan  ( F. microcarpa ),  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ).   On the other hand the Common Fig ( Ficus carica ) is a dioecious plant, as well as  F. aspera ,  Roxburgh Fig  ( F. auriculata ),  Mistletoe Fig  ( F. deltoidea ),  F. pseudopalma ,  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ) and related species.     The hermaphrodite Common Figs are called  ""inedible figs""  or  caprifigs ; in traditional culture in the  Mediterranean region , they were considered food for  goats  ( Capra aegagrus ). In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the  ""edible figs"" .  Fig wasps  grow in Common Fig caprifigs but not in the female syconiums because the female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the fig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. Fig wasps are not known to transmit any diseases harmful to humans.   When a caprifig ripens, another caprifig must be ready to be pollinated. In temperate climes, wasps hibernate in figs, and there are distinct crops. Common Fig [ verification needed ]  caprifigs have three crops per year; edible figs have two. The first ( breba [ 6 ] ) produces small fruits called  olynth . Some  parthenocarpic   cultivars  of Common Figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of figs (albeit  sterile ) in the absence of caprifigs or fig wasps.   There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig, and therefore plantings of fig species outside of their native range results in effectively sterile individuals. For example, in  Hawaii , some 60 species of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there. This is an example of  mutualism , i.e. one organism (fig plant) can not propagate itself without the other one (fig wasp).   The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators, along with the high incidence of a one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio have long led scientists to believe that figs and wasps are a clear example of  coevolution . Morphological and reproductive behavior evidence, such as the correspondence between fig and wasp larvae maturation rates, have been cited as support for this hypothesis for many years [ 7 ] . Additionally, recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a very close correspondence in the character evolution and  speciation  phylogenies of these two clades.

Ficus citrifolia , also known as the  Shortleaf Fig ,  Giant Bearded Fig  or  Wild Banyantree , is a species of  banyan  native to southern  Florida , the  Caribbean ,  Central America , and northern  South America  south to  Paraguay . It is distinguished from the closely-related Florida Strangler Fig ( Ficus aurea ) mainly by the finer veining in the  leaves .           Contents       1   Description   2   Ecology   3   Keystone Species   4   Genetic Mosaics   5   History   6   Medicine   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Description          Leaves and seeds, So Paulo, Brazil       Ficus citrifolia  trees typically grow 15 m (50  ft ) tall, and may cover a wide area due to their ability to drop aerial roots from branches and spread horizontally, fusing with the parent tree as they grow. They have a broad top, light grey bark, some aerial roots and milky sap. The leaves of  F. citrifolia  are dark green. They are oval shaped with a rounded base and pointed tip. Small flowers are enclosed in open ended fruit. The fruit appears on the ends of long stalks protruding from the leaf axils. Fruit turn from yellow to dark-red when ripe. This fruit is sweet and can be eaten raw. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Ecology   New trees begin their life as an  epiphyte , a strategy which allows them to avoid competition for light and land.  F. citrifolia  commonly attacks palms,  bald cypress ,  oaks  and other trees, strangling them as it grows.   Ficus citrifolia  is under strong selective pressure to flower and produce fruit year round due to its mutualistic relationship with its pollinating  agaonid  wasp. Agaonid wasps have a symbiotic relationship with figs such that a given agaonid species acts as a pollinator for just one species of fig, and a particular fig species is pollinated by just one species of wasp.  F. citrifolia  is pollinated by  P. asseutus . After pollination, figs ripen quickly. Fruit bearing figs are heavily laden; a single tree may produce up to 1,000,000 fruits with a diameter of 1-2.5 cm. The fruit of  F. citrifolia  tends to have a purgative effect on the digestive systems of many animals; ripe fruits are eaten and seeds are spread widely through dung. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Keystone Species   Ficus citrifolia  is considered a  tropical   keystone species . Figs are a major component of the diets of more species of animals than any other tropical perennial fruit. Since  F. citrifolia  fruits year round many primates, birds and other species, feed exclusively on figs during seasons when other fruit is scarce. Additionally, the knobby, hollow, lattice-like trunk of this tree provides a home for thousands of invertebrates, rodents, bats, birds and reptiles. [ 3 ]   F. citrifolia  is considered common and is not in danger of extinction.     [ edit ]   Genetic Mosaics   F. citrifolia  may fuse with figs of other species types, creating a cumulate tree that is a genetic mosaic. Research suggests that the frequency of genetic mosaicism among strangler figs may be quite high; it is unknown how this variation effects flowering in mosaic figs. (Thomson et al., 1995). Thomson et al. suggest that if genetically different segments of a single tree flower asynchronously, agaonid wasp populations may be more resistant to low host population sizes that previously thought. Alternately, genetic mosaicism could mean that the number of certain varieties of fig in an ecosystem may be far lower than biologists have previously thought, and given populations may not have enough trees to maintain their symbiotic relationship with their pollinating wasps. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   History   One theory is that the Portuguese name for  F. citrifolia , ""Os Barbados"", gave  Barbados  its name. It appears on the  Coat of arms  of  Barbados , and the removal of one specimen, over 100 years old, was enough to draw attention. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Medicine   An extract of  F. Citrifolia  may have therapeutic value for  chemotherapy  patients. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   References     ^  How to be a Fig, Daniel H.

The  Common fig  ( Ficus carica ) is a large,  deciduous ,  shrub  or small  tree  native to southwest  Asia  and the eastern  Mediterranean  region (from  Greece  to  Pakistan ).   It grows to a height of 3-10m tall, with smooth grey  bark .   The  leaves  are 1225 cm long and 1018 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes.   The  fruit  is 35 cm long, with a green skin sometimes ripening towards purple. The  sap  of the tree's green parts is an irritant to human skin.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer (@0) in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words 溿,  skon , ""fig"", and Ʊ,  phanM , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.). Figs from  Attica  were especially prized and were a valuable export commodity. As a result, Athens had decreed that the very profitable fig business was to be a state  monopoly  and all fig growers were obliged to sell their entire produce to the state. Falsely accusing someone of clandestine transactions with figs was therefore a convenient way to  slander  them before the courts.   The figrid tree is sacred to  Dionysus  Sukites (źķ).

The  Common fig  ( Ficus carica ) is a large,  deciduous ,  shrub  or small  tree  native to southwest  Asia  and the eastern  Mediterranean  region (from  Greece  to  Pakistan ). It grows to a height of 3-10m tall, with smooth grey  bark . The  leaves  are 1225 cm long and 1018 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The  fruit  is 35 cm long, with a green skin sometimes ripening towards purple. The  sap  of the tree's green parts is an irritant to human skin.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer () in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   Cato the Elder was a Roman statesman who urged the Romans to the Third Punic War to destroy Carthage. Before the Senate, he produced a handful of fresh figs, said to be from Carthage. This showed its proximity to Rome (and hence the threat) - figs are also associated with femininity (due to the appearance of the inside of the fruit), and an insult may have been intended.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00hdd5x/In_Our_Time_The_Destruction_of_Carthage/   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words ,  skon , ""fig"", and ,  phan , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.).

It is widespread but not terribly common, usually appearing as an individual plant amongst other species. It was discovered by  Meriwether Lewis  in 1804.           Philadelphus lewisii  flowers       The shrub is rounded and grows to 1.5-3 m in height. It sends out long stems which are red when new and fade to gray with age, the bark shredding in small flakes. The opposite leaves vary in size across individual plants but they are usually oval, 3-5 cm long, smooth or serrated along the edges, and light green in color with a rough texture. The  flowers  are produced in clusters at the ends of long stems, with four white petals 5-40 mm long and numerous yellow  stamens . At the height of flowering, the plant is covered in a mass of blossoms. The flowers have a heavy, sweet scent similar to  orange blossoms  with a hint of  pineapple . The  fruit  is a small hard  capsule  1 cm long with woody, pointed wings, containing many brown 2.5-3 mm long seeds.   Native American tribes used  P. lewisii  for numerous purposes. The hard wood was useful for making hunting and fishing tools, snowshoes, pipes, and furniture. The leaves and bark, which contain  saponins , were mixed in water for use as a mild soap.   Other names include ""wild mock-orange"" (though this can apply to any species in the genus), and ""Syringa"", a confusing name as it usually refers to the unrelated  lilacs .     [ edit ]   Cultivation   Lewis's Mock-orange prefers full sun to partial sun. It is drought-tolerant and will grow in poor soils, and provides a landscape with flashy flowers and a fruity scent.   Philadelphus lewisii is the  state flower  of  Idaho .

Species         About 800, see  text         Ficus  is a  genus  of about 850  species  of woody  trees ,  shrubs ,  vines ,  epiphytes , and  hemiepiphyte  in the  family   Moraceae . Collectively known as  fig trees  or  figs , they are native throughout the  tropics  with a few species extending into the semi-warm  temperate  zone. The so-called  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) is a temperate species from the Middle East and eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its  fruit , also referred to as  figs . The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as  bushfood . However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

Take, for example, the  Common Fig , a small temperate deciduous tree whose fingered  fig leaf  is well-known in art and  iconography ; or the  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) a hemi-epiphyte with thin tough leaves on pendulous stalks adapted to its  rain forest  habitat; or the rough-leaved  sandpaper figs  from  Australia ; or the  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ), a vine whose small, hard leaves form a dense carpet of foliage over rocks or garden walls. Moreover, figs with different plant habits have undergone  adaptive radiation  in different  biogeographic  regions, often leading to very high levels of  alpha diversity . In the tropics, it is quite common to find that  Ficus  is the most species-rich plant genus in a particular forest. In Asia as many as 70 or more species can co-exist. [ 1 ]   The specific identification of many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have  aerial roots  and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The fig fruit is an enclosed  inflorescence , sometimes referred to as a  syconium , an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig  pollination  system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, know as  fig wasps  that enter these closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists [ 2 ] . Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish sap ( latex ), some in copious quantities; the twig has paired  stipules  or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as a ""tri-veined"".   Unfortunately, there are no unambiguous older  fossils  of  Ficus . However, current  molecular clock  estimates indicate that  Ficus  is a relatively ancient genus being at least 60 million years old [ 2 ] , and possibly as old as 80 million years. The main radiation of  extant  species, however, may have taken place more recently, between 20 and 40 million years ago.     [ edit ]   Ecology and uses           Coppersmith Barbet  feeding on  White Fig  ( Ficus virens ) fruit       Figs are  keystone species  in many  rainforest   ecosystems . Their fruit are a key resource for some  frugivores  including  fruit bats ,  capuchin monkeys ,  langurs  and  mangabeys . They are even more important for some  birds .  Asian barbets ,  pigeons ,  hornbills ,  fig-parrots  and  bulbuls  are examples of  taxa  which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many  Lepidoptera   caterpillars , for example of several  Euploea  species (Crow butterflies), the  Plain Tiger  ( Danaus chrysippus ), the  Giant Swallowtail  ( Papilio cresphontes ), the  Brown Awl  ( Badamia exclamationis ), and  Chrysodeixis eriosoma ,  Choreutidae  and  Copromorphidae   moths  feed on fig leaves. The  Citrus long-horned beetle  ( Anoplophora chinensis ), for example, has larvae which feed on  wood , including that of fig trees; it can become a  pest  in fig plantations. Similarly, the  Sweet Potato Whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as  potted plants  and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see  List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae) .          Leaves of the  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa )       The wood of fig trees is often soft and the  latex  precludes its use for many purposes. It was used to make  mummy   caskets  in  Ancient Egypt . Certain fig species (mainly  F. cotinifolia ,  F. insipida  and  F. padifolia ) are traditionally used in  Mesoamerica  to produce  papel amate  ( Nahuatl :  matl ).  Mutuba  ( F. natalensis ) is used to produce  barkcloth  in  Uganda .  Pou  ( F. religiosa  leaves' shape inspired one of the standard  kbach rachana , decorative elements in  Cambodian  architecture.  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) and  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ) are identified as powerful air-cleaning plants in the  NASA Clean Air Study .  Indian Banyan  ( F. bengalensis ) and the Indian Rubber Plant, as well as other species, have use in  herbalism . The latter is known to be a  hyperaccumulator  of  benzene  and  methane [ dubious     discuss ] , and urban or potted plants should be considered toxic for that reason.          A page from the  Mexican   Huexotzinco Codex , painted on  matl       Figs have figured prominently in some human cultures. There is evidence that figs, specifically the  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ), were among the first - if not the very first - plant species that were deliberately bred for agriculture in the  Middle East , starting more than 11,000 years ago. Nine  subfossil   F. carica  figs dated to about  9400-9200 BC  were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of  Jericho ). These were a  parthenocarpic  type and thus apparently an early cultivar. This find predates the cultivation of  grain  in the  Middle East  by many hundreds of years. [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Cultural and spiritual significance   Fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the  Sacred Fig  tree ( Peepul, Bodhi, Bo,  or  Po, Ficus religiosa ) and the  Banyan  Fig ( Ficus benghalensis ). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a  Ficus religiosa  tree known as the  Sri Maha Bodhi  planted in the temple at  Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BC. It is one of the two sacred trees of  Islam , and there is a  sura  in Quran named ""The Fig"" or  At-Tin ( ), and in  East Asia , figs are pivotal in  Buddhism ,  Hinduism  and  Jainism .  Siddhrtha Gautama , the Supreme  Buddha , is traditionally held to have found  bodhi  (enlightenment) while meditating under a  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ). The same species was  Ashvastha , the "" world tree "" of Hinduism. The  Plaksa  Pra-sravana  was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the  Sarasvati River  sprang forth; it is usually held to be a Sacred Fig but more probably seems to be a  Wavy-leaved Fig  ( F. infectoria ). The Common Fig tree is cited in the  Bible , where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The fig fruit is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah ( Deut.  8). Other important plants reported included:  wheat , barley,  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  olives , and dates (representing the honey). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit ( Mark 11:12-14 ).     [ edit ]   Fig pollination and fig fruit     See also:  Common Fig            A  Common Fig   syconium  (fruit)       Many are grown for their fruits, though only  Ficus carica  is cultivated to any extent for this purpose. Furthermore, the fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergens, and the sap is a serious eye irritant. The fig is commonly thought of as fruit, but it is properly the flower of the fig tree. It is in fact a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus  Dorstenia , also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.

Source:  USDA Nutrient database       A fig ""fruit"" is derived from a specially adapted type of  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers). In this case, it is an involuted, nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the  inner  surface. Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open. In  Chinese  the fig is called  w hu gu  ) Traditional Chinese :   ;  Simplified Chinese :   ; ), ""fruit without flower"" [ 4 ] . In  Bengali , where the Common Fig is called  dumur , it is referenced in a proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele  (""You have become [invisible like] the  dumur  flower"").   The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the  ostiole ) at the outward end that allows access to  pollinators . The flowers are pollinated by  very small wasps  that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be one of the many tiny mature, seed-bearing flowers found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, the flowers will appear as fleshy ""threads"", each bearing a single seed inside.   The fig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (hermaphrodite and female): [ 5 ]     All the native fig trees of the American continent are hermaphrodites, as well as species like  Indian Banyan  ( F. benghalensis ),  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ),  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ),  Fiddle-leaved Fig  ( F. lyrata ),  Moreton Bay Fig  ( F. macrophylla ),  Chinese Banyan  ( F. microcarpa ),  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ).   On the other hand the Common Fig ( Ficus carica ) is a dioecious plant, as well as  F. aspera ,  Roxburgh Fig  ( F. auriculata ),  Mistletoe Fig  ( F. deltoidea ),  F. pseudopalma ,  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ) and related species.     The hermaphrodite Common Figs are called  ""inedible figs""  or  caprifigs ; in traditional culture in the  Mediterranean region , they were considered food for  goats  ( Capra aegagrus ). In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the  ""edible figs"" .  Fig wasps  grow in Common Fig caprifigs but not in the female syconiums because the female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the fig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. Fig wasps are not known to transmit any diseases harmful to humans.   When a caprifig ripens, another caprifig must be ready to be pollinated. In temperate climes, wasps hibernate in figs, and there are distinct crops. Common Fig [ verification needed ]  caprifigs have three crops per year; edible figs have two. The first ( breba [ 6 ] ) produces small fruits called  olynth . Some  parthenocarpic   cultivars  of Common Figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of figs (albeit  sterile ) in the absence of caprifigs or fig wasps.   There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig, and therefore plantings of fig species outside of their native range results in effectively sterile individuals. For example, in  Hawaii , some 60 species of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there. This is an example of  mutualism , i.e. one organism (fig plant) can not propagate itself without the other one (fig wasp).   The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators, along with the high incidence of a one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio have long led scientists to believe that figs and wasps are a clear example of  coevolution . Morphological and reproductive behavior evidence, such as the correspondence between fig and wasp larvae maturation rates, have been cited as support for this hypothesis for many years [ 7 ] . Additionally, recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a very close correspondence in the character evolution and  speciation  phylogenies of these two clades.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer () in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words ,  skon , ""fig"", and ,  phan , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.). Figs from  Attica  were especially prized and were a valuable export commodity. As a result, Athens had decreed that the very profitable fig business was to be a state  monopoly  and all fig growers were obliged to sell their entire produce to the state. Falsely accusing someone of clandestine transactions with figs was therefore a convenient way to  slander  them before the courts.   The figrid tree is sacred to  Dionysus  Sukites ().

Fig Fruit Facts Page Information                      Availability  by variety                                  Figs are believed to be indigenous to western Asia and to have been distributed     by man throughout the Mediterranean area. Remnants of figs have been found in     excavations of sites traced to at least 5,000 B.C.             In the United States, the major centers for commercial production of cultivated     figs are California and Texas. The more popular Californian varieties are packed     fresh or dried. Most Texas figs are canned.             Figs were brought to California by the Spanish missionary fathers who first     planted them at the San Diego Mission in 1759. Fig trees were then planted at     each succeeding mission, going North through California. The Mission fig,     Californias leading black fig, takes its name from this history. The popular     Calimyrna fig, golden brown in color, is the Smyrna variety that was brought to     Californias San Joaquin Valley from Turkey in 1882, and was renamed Calimyrna     in honor of its new homeland.

clueweb09-en0008-44-37179	"                                     HISTORY           A. Old World           The fig is mentioned         frequently in the Bible and is included in the garden of Eden. It is a         traditional food in the Jewish Passover celebration. The fig tree         figures in the founding of great cultures and religions. Romulus and         Remus, the founders of Rome, were suckled by a she-wolf under a fig         tree, which later, in the time of Pliny, was revered as a sacred tree.         While sitting under a fig tree, Siddhartha Gautama had the revelation         that formed the foundations of Buddhism. Figs have been prized for both         medicinal and dietary value. Mithridates, the Greek king of Pontus         (120-63 B.C.), heralded figs as an antidote for all ailments and         instructed his physicians to consider its uses as a medicine. Pliny of         Rome (62-113) said ""Figs are restorative. The best food that can be         eaten by those who are brought low by long sickness and are on the way         to recovery. They increase the strength of young people, preserve the         elderly in better health and make them look younger with fewer         wrinkles"". The early Greeks so highly prized figs that it was         considered an honor to bestow the foliage and fruit. In the original         Olympic games, winning athletes were crowned with fig wreaths and given         figs to eat.                    The common fig probably originated in the fertile part of southern         Arabia (Solms-Laubach 1885). Ancient records indicate both King         Urukagina of the Sumarian era (2900 B.C.) and the Assyrians (2000 B.c.)         were familiar with it. No records of its introduction to this area         exist, but the caprifig, ancestor of the edible fig, is still found         there growing wild. From southern Arabia the Bahra tribe brought the fig         to ancient Idumaea and Coelsyria (Lagarde 1881). Over a period of         several centuries, it slowly spread from there to Syria and the         Mediterranean coast. Once figs reached the coast, they rapidly spread         throughout the Mediterranean region aided by the maritime nations. They         were known in Crete by 1600 B.C.                     While it is probable         that the home of the edible fig is ancient Arabia, the origin of the         cultivated fig industry is most certainly elsewhere. Almost all         currently cultivated subtropicals, e.g., citrus, almonds, pistachios,         walnuts, peaches, olives, dates, and prunes, were initially cultivated         in unknown locations in western Asia or Asia Minor. The only known         civilization of sufficient age and sophistication capable of these         accomplishments is that of the Mesopotamians, who dwelt in the Tigris         and Euphrates river valleys over 10,000 years ago and are credited as         the original cultivators of many modem important horticultural and         agronomic crops (Eisen 1901).                    The Phoenicians and the Greeks, the greatest Old World colonizers,         independently, and via different routes, were responsible for spreading         fig culture throughout the Old World. By the end of the 14th century         B.C. the older of the two, the Phoenicians, had colonized the islands of         the          Mediterranean: Cyprus, Rhodes, Sicily, Malta, and Corsica. Their         colonization to the south included the coasts of Africa, Spain,         Portugal, and France and up to the English Channel. Evidence indicates         the fig industry spread with these explorations prior to its         introduction into Greece and Italy.                    The recorded history of the fig industry begins with its introduction         into the Mediterranean outside Asia, and particularly into Greece. Some         of the earliest Greek reportings of figs are in mythological literature.         According to Greek mythology, Zeus was pursuing Ge and her son, Sykeus,         In the war of the Titans when, to save him, she metamorphosed into a fig         tree. The ancient city of Sykea is named for this myth. Another Greek         myth credits the goddess Demeter (Ceres) as introducing the ""fruit         of autumn"" to humans. Among the Hellenes, figs were sacred to the         libidinous and bibulous god, Dionysius. According to myth he placed a         phallus of fig wood on the grave of Polyhymnos as a substitute for a         promised favor, which he kept for himself. To this day the phallus         carried at Dionysian festivals is carved of fig wood and the fig tree is         the tree of phallic worshippers. The use of figs among early Greeks         paralleled their rise in the literature: when mention of figs was         infrequent in the literature, fresh figs were a luxury of the rich.         Later, when references were common, figs had become an important dietary         staple, particularly dried figs during winter months.                    It is uncertain when figs were first introduced to Europe. They are         hardly mentioned in the Homeric songs (ca. 850 B.C.), the oldest         existing European literature. There is no reference to them in the         Iliad, the description of the Trojan war waged by the Greeks. However,         in the Odyssey, the description of Odysseus' wanderings after the war,         figs are mentioned three times; during the agonies of Tantulus in the         lower world he tried in vain to reach the fruits almost within his         grasp: ""...pomegranates, pears, apples, sweet figs and dark         olives."" As the Homeric songs were probably composed in the ninth         century B.C. these references would be among the earliest. However,         later investigations st the verses mentioning figs were interpolations         of a later date. The st mention of undoubted authenticity is by the         seventh-century B.C. Archilochus, who tells of figs being cultivated on         the isle of Paros. these few references it can be deduced that figs were         introduced Greece in the eighth century B.C., probably from the Semitic         nations s from Palestine and Asia Minor. Thereafter, in the seventh         century, B.C., Attica and Sikyon, the latter named after syke 'fig' in         Greek became famous for their figs. Because they were so highly valued,         the in ruler Solon, (639-559 B.C..) decreed against their export,         reserving Lise solely for the Greeks. Xerxes, the king of Persia, ate         Attican figs to remind him of the desirability of conquering a place         that could ice such fine fruit.                    Once introduced fig cultivation quickly spread throughout Greece to         become an important article of diet for both rich and poor. The term         ""sycophant"" has its origins in ancient Greece. Athenians were         particularly fond of figs and were nicknamed ""sycophants"" (syke         or fig-eaters). Later, when members of the same population informed         authorities of illegally exporting figs from Attica, the word assumed         its modern meaning. From this time on the fig is mentioned frequently in         Greek literature.                    From Greece, fig culture spread to northern Mediterranean and Adriatic         shores until it reached southern Italy. There it must have been         established by the eighth century B.C. as it is mentioned in the         earliest Roman mythology in conjunction with the founding of Rome, as         previously mentioned.                    Figs were sufficiently important to Romans that considerable effort         expended developing new cultivars. These were sufficiently numerous and         distinct for Pliny (23-27) to note: ""We see from this how the real         law which preserves the types of the species may vary."" The         cultivars described by Theophrastus, Cato, and Pliny can no longer be         identified with certainty and probably have long since been discarded in         of better ones. The many cultivars mentioned by Greek and Latin authors         indicate that fig culture was extensively distributed and of great         importance. Also, from these writings it appears that the best figs were         those of Syria. During the reign of the emperor Tiberius (42 B.C.-37         A.D.) was considerable trade in Syrian figs.                    By the end of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, fig culture was         well distributed throughout the Mediterranean and along the shores         of  the Atlantic; it stretched from Africa, Portugal, France,         Channel Islands, and the southern part of England. However, Syria was         preeminent in the cultivation and drying of figs. The hieroglyphic for         fig was bakou and was often referred to as a country rich in wine, oil,         and bakou (Chabas 1782).                    Seventeen hundred years after the Phoenician colonization, the Arabic         conquests retraced their route. They carried the fig in its numerous new         permutations, and raised fig culture to a degree of importance it had         never attained since Syria. The Arabic invasion extended through         northern Africa to Spain and Portugal and in these countries fig culture         flourished rapidly and became even more important than it had been in         Greece or Italy. Arabs esteemed figs above all other fruits.         Zamakkhschari, an Arabian interpreter of the Koran, reported that         Mohammed said, ""If I could wish a fruit brought to paradise it         would certainly be the fig.""                    These Arabic medieval invasions indelibly stamped their mark on fig         culture in the occupied territories. The figs grown there were vastly         superior to those of the Greek and Roman colonies. Algarve In Portugal,         the most southern of the Greek colonies outside the Pillars of Hercules,         was later occupied by Arabs, and with its almost ideal climate, it         produced a fig that dominated Western European and English markets well         into the nineteenth century. The now dominant Smyrna fig did not         supplant the Portuguese figs until late in the nineteenth century.         Arabic influence is still felt today in Portugal where caprifigs are         referred to as fico de toca, from the Arabic name tokkar, and in Malta         where the name tokar is still in use.                    Figs moved east more slowly than they moved west as they thrive in arid         climates and are not suited to the humid tropics of India and Asia. They         became a dietary staple in Greece centuries before they were introduced         to Media or Persia. This lack of knowledge of figs caused the Greeks to         consider the Medes and Persians barbaric. A Greek military advisor of         the time warned his king, Kroisos, not to wage war with         ""...barbarians who know neither wine nor figs"" (Hehn 1877).         However, wild varieties similar to caprifigs are still found in Persia         and India which could have been used to produce an edible fig.         Therefore, it is possible, although no evidence exists, that figs were         cultivated prior to the fourteenth century in Persia and India.           The fig spread slowly         through Asia Minor and Syria to Mesopotamia, Persia, and the Arabian         desert. Fig culture was still unknown in the lowlands between the Tigris         and Euphrates (Solms-Laubach 1885) by the time it had been highly         developed in Iran, Armenia, and Afghanistan. India first cultivated figs         in the fourteenth century and edible native varieties are now found         growing in the Punjab hills.                    Figs supposedly reached China in 127 during the reign of the emperor         Tschang-Kien, who supported an expedition to Turin, Italy, but some feel         this early report is a myth. The fig is first mentioned by Chinese         writers in the eighth century, and therefore it is generally thought         figs reached China no earlier than the Tang period (618-907).         Hia-tscheng-Shi in his work on Chinese trade, Yu-yang-tsa-tsu, speaks of         tin-tin; tin is 'fig' in Arabic, from Fo-tin (Palestine). He mentions         that this fruit was produced without blossoms, which is the appearance         figs give. A type of fig, apparently not identical to our own, was grown         in China in the fourteenth century. The first verifiable report of fig         culture in China was that of the celebrated writer Le-Shi-tschen who         described figs growing in Chinese gardens. From this point on it is safe         to assume the fig was firmly established in the Far East.                    Although well regarded in Egypt, the fig never assumed great prominence;         a papyrus from 1552 B.C.. extols it as a tonic for the body. Tombs at         Benihassan depict fig trees being harvested (Unger 1859; Zohary 1975).         The spread of figs southward in Africa was even slower, not reaching         South Africa until the nineteenth century.                    B. New World           Figs were first         introduced into the New World by Spanish and Portuguese missionaries.         The Spanish historian Puente y Olea (1900) located records of European         fig shipments from Seville, Spain to the West Indies in 1520. Oviedo y         Validez (1526) tells of fig trees growing on the Island of Espanola (now         Cuba). Then, as now, market protection existed. While the island was a         Spanish colony, families were each allowed only one fig tree to prevent         competition with the mother country (Canova 1910). Simultaneously, the         Spanish also introduced figs to Peru in 1528 (Acosta 1590; Tamaro 1920).                    From the West Indies figs spread to both coasts of the United States         (Unger 1859, 1860). Initially, they were quickly adopted by local         populations. However, by the twentieth century they had become a         thriving industry In the southwest and a dooryard tree In the         southeastern United States.           1. Eastern United         States. From Cuba, figs were introduced to Santa Elena (Parris Island,         South Carolina) on the southeastern coast of the United States in 1575         and quickly spread throughout the region (Menendez 1500; Martinez 1577).         Independently, they were introduced to Virginia from Bermuda in 1621         (Brown 1898). A town in Florida, established In 1763 by one Dr. Turnbull         who sponsored the immigration of 1500 Greeks and Minorcans, was named         New Smyrna, after the popular cultivar of fig produced there (Forbes         1821). In 1720, figs from France were introduced by the French         missionaries to their colony, the Louisiana Territory (Hamilton 1910).         Figs thrived throughout the region and reports of them in the         Southeastern United States were numerous after this time (Brickell 1737;         Berquin-Duvallon 1806; Nuttall 1821; Ash 1836; Starnes 1903; Evans 1904;         Hall 1910; Hamilton 1910; Smith 1910; Sandford 1911; Gould 1919; Gray         1933; Snydor 1938; Bartram 1940).                    However, while fig trees themselves quickly spread, predominantly north         and westward, the development of an industry did not follow throughout         the southeastern United States. The naturalist Bartram (1942) was         surprised that figs were not more prevalent in Florida. Other historians         remarked on the small size and lack of development of such a potentially         lucrative industry (Bruce 1935; Beverly 1947). Walker (1919) stated that         the fig tree"". . . grows easily and luxuriantly-but there is no         recorded effort of its being dried in marketable quantities, and it has         never become as it might, a staple crop."" This failure was not due         to lack of interest on the part of influential horticulturists or         nurserymen. Both Thomas Jefferson and the horticulturist Thomas Affleck         actively imported and distributed new cultivars, primarily from France (Affleck         1842, 1844; Edwards 1943; Betts 1944; Hedrick 1950). Other enthusiastic         horticulturists from Ohio, Illinois, and Washington, D.C. attempted to         develop an industry in the same manner, offering new cultivars and         publishing circulars detailing fig culture (Worthington 1869; Needham         1879; Benson 1886). One, G. F. Needham of Washington, D.C., wrote"".         . . no other crop can be raised which will give so certain and so large         returns in our Middle and Northern States as that delicious fruit, the         fig."" A conversation overheard by Margaret Smith (1906), in a         Washington, D.C. restaurant in 1835, underscores their popularity:         ""No nuts, raisins, figs, etc.?"" ""Oh, no, no, ma'am, they         are quite vulgar.""                    Despite these efforts and an obviously successful fig tree culture in         the southeastern United States, a fig industry failed to develop. Some         records of failed attempts exist. J. K. Russell of Olustee, Florida,         destroyed his orchard due to high labor costs and foreign competition (Reasoner         1891). This is interesting in light of the fact that competition from         Old World countries is still one of the most pressing problems facing         the California industry today. Other Florida plantings were given up as         ""unsuccessful"" (Reasoner 1891) or were frozen out (Swingle         1893). Some successful records exist; in 1910 F. C. Reimer (1910)         reported one orchard of figs in Raleigh, North Carolina, which         ""during the past five years netted the owner greater returns than         any acre in other fruits in the eastern half of the state.""         However, these individual success stories are rare. H. P. Gould reported         in 1919 that fig trees are common only as garden or dooryard trees in         the fig belt east of the Mississippi where they were found as large and         lovely additions to historic towns, and estates (Irving, 1860; Orr,         1871; Hoppin, 1926; Sale, 1930).           2. Western United         States. A complete history of the fig in California has been documented         in detail by Wickson (1888), Eisen (1901), Roeding (1903), Swingle         (1908), Rixford (1918), Butterfield (1938), and Condit (1933), and         therefore, this review will only touch upon the main events.                    In spite of the fact that figs were well distributed throughout the         southeastern United States they did not spread initially from there to         the western United States. Rather, they were imported from the West         Indies to Spanish missions in Mexico. It Is generally accepted that they         subsequently spread from Mexico to California with the Franciscan         missionaries. The first California figs were planted in 1769 in the         gardens of the mission at San Diego. These same figs were planted in the         string of missions stretching northward to Sonoma, and according to         Mission records, they existed in Santa Clara by 1792 and in Ventura by         1793 (Vancouver 1798). Hence, the first figs in California were         'Mission' or 'Franciscan' figs.                    'Mission' figs remained the only figs in California until the arrival of         American settlers from the east in 1850 who then imported a wide variety         of figs from the eastern United States and Europe. These imports led to         the establishment of the first commercial fig orchards in California. By         1867 there were over 1000 acres (400 ha) in the Sacramento Valley and 35         acres (15 ha) in the San Joaquin Valley. 'White Adriatic' was the most         widely planted cultivar. A 27-acre (11 ha) orchard of 'White Adriatic'         figs planted in Fresno in 1885 produced the first carload of dried figs         sent east in 1889.                    The 'White Adriatic' fig remained the most popular California fig until         the twentieth century. W. A. Taylor (1898) wrote of the 'White         Adriatic': (it) has many points of merit. . . but the fact that its         quality when dried is inferior to that of the imported dried fruit from         Smyrna has resulted in several efforts to introduce and grow the Smyrna         type of fig."" The first California introduction of its successor,         the true Smyrna ('Lob Injir') fig, was made in 1880 by P, C. Rixford,         manager of the San Francisco Evening Bulletin. Within ten years, more         Smyrna cultivars were introduced by a Fresno nursery, the California         State Board of Horticulture, and the USDA. These rooted cuttings and         trees were planted in various San Joaquin and Sacramento Valley         locations, including Governor Leland Stanford's Vina ranch.                    All these imports grew vigorously, but they displayed a common problem.         Although they profusely produced buds and set fruit, the fruit did not         persist beyond walnut size; uniformly all fruits dropped by early         summer. The widespread notion that worthless Smyrna cuttings had been         distributed was quelled when Smyrna figs propagated from seeds produced         the same result.                    This problem renewed interest in the long simmering debate concerning         pollination of Smyrna-type figs. Eisen had previously reported in detail         the necessity of pollinating, or caprifying, Smyrna-type figs (Condit         1947). Not until 1890 when C. Roeding of Fresno demonstrated that         caprification was necessary for fruit set did the California industry         attempt to obtain the fig wasp, and its vehicle, the inedible monoecious         caprifig. The first caprifigs entered California in 1890 with separate         fig imports from Asia Minor (Swingle 1908). Smyrna, and Mexico. Repeated         failures to successfully achieve pollination at this point led to the         conclusion that each Smyrna cultivar required a specific blastophaga.         Therefore, the USDA agricultural explorer W. T. Swingle continued         collecting caprifigs from Greece and Algeria through the nineteenth         century. Finally, mamme Smyrna-type figs that reached Fresno,         California, in April of 1899 successfully issued wasps on June 23, 1899.         This date is the 'true beginning of the California commercial fig         industry.                     The story of         blastophaga's California' introduction has a colorful subplot. As early         as 1868 a Mr. Gates of Modesto, California claimed to have a caprifig         tree with a mamme crop that harbored the fig wasp (Swingle and Rixford         1911). Roeding (1910), the introducer of record, disputed the claim with         Gates in parallel columns of the Dec. 29, 1910 California Cultivator.         Roeding concluded his argument with: ""Is it possible as a poor         despised worm, ant, and fly, you have resided in Stanislaus county these         many years? Oh! that I could believe it.""                    With Smyrna fig production now assured the fledgling industry set about         promotion. ""No horticultural event since the discovery and         propagation of the navel orange can compare in commercial importance to         the recent establishment of Smyrna fig culture in California. Its         successful introduction into the state marks a new epoch in our fruit         interests and those who engage in it first will reap large         profits."" Thus stated a promotional circular of the Ceres Fig Lands         Company. As with many commercial ventures this initial assessment was         true for a time, and the Smyrna fig, soon known as the 'California         Smyrna' or 'Calimyrna', became its leading cultivar.                    The beginning of the twentieth century through 1943 was the heyday of         the California fig industry. By 1943, California had 34,499 acres         (14,000 ha) of figs, 96% of it bearing and virtually all of it In the         central San Joaquin Valley. The bearing crop area consisted of 40% 'Calimyrna',         26% 'White Adriatic', 18% 'Black Mission' and 15% 'Kadota'. The 1943         crop, largest of record, was 29,400 t merchantable and 6,700 t         substandard grade fruit. From this zenith the industry entered a decline         that persisted through 1972. At its nadir California fig area dropped to         16,628 acres (6,753 ha) with 93% of it bearing, and consisting of 54% 'Calimyrnas',         26% 'White Adriatic', 11% 'Kadota', and 10% 'Black Mission' figs. The         primary reason for the decline was the perennial problem of foreign         competition with its relatively low cost labor. This coupled with         increasing domestic labor costs, encroachment of residential and         industrial development into the primary production areas, and an         unfavorable tax structure that taxed agricultural land on adjacent         property rather than actual use, caused the California fig industry to         decline.                    The 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, which closed the Suez Canal and         therefore Mediterranean shipping channels from the east, created a         demand for California figs. The availability of abundant, inexpensive,         irrigated land on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley as a result of         the completion of the California Aqueduct, and the need to plant an         early-bearing crop to defray taxes and stand-by water charges,         facilitated new fig plantings. The net result was a resurgence in the         industry starting with increased plantings in 1968. From 1973 through         1967 the industry area has fluctuated between a low of 15,910 acres         (6,439 ha) in 1978 to a 1981 high of 21,520 acres (8,709 ha). The         current cultivar percentage has shifted toward 'Calimyrnas' (59%) and         'Black Missions,' (16%), and away from 'White Adriatics' (19%) and 'Kadotas,'         (7%) (California Fig Advisory Board 1988).                    Currently, California ranks third in world fig production after Turkey         and Greece, and ahead of Spain and Portugal. The state produces 100% of         domestic fig production and 65% of the figs consumed in the country. In         1987 it produced a total of 15,000 t of figs with a total value of $16         million. Of the 26 noncitrus fruit crops produced in California, figs         rank 22nd in value and 18th in bearing area (Moyer 1989).                    The California fig industry has formed a mandatory California State         Dried Fig Marketing Order for the purposes of grade and quality standard         enforcement, market development, and production research support. The         industry also voluntarily supports the California Fig Advisory Board and         the California Fig Institute-organizations formed to administer product         and market development, and production research,                    III. BOTANY           A. Taxonomy           The mulberry family,         Moraceae, to which figs belong contains 60 genera and possibly more than         2,000 species of trees, shrubs, vines, and herbs. Common edible figs and         their pollinating counterpart, caprifigs, are members of the subgenus         Eusyce within Ficus carica-a species characterized by only unisexual         axillary flowers and by gynodioecism. It is the only member of its genus         cultivated for its fruit. Several allied members of this subgenus         closely resemble true Ficus species, and members intermediate in form         between true Ficus and these allied species suggest hybridization among         them. This could explain some of the difficulties among botanists with         species delineation and characterization of Ficus spp. Numerous studies         exist on the classification of Ficus (Condit 1955, 1969; Condit and         Enderud 1956), but there are great disagreements. The estimated number         of species in the genus Ficus range from 600 (Engler 1889; Lyon 1922,         1929; Ridley 1922, 1930) to 800 (Verdoorn 1938) to 900 (Corner 1933,         1960ab, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967) to 1,000 (Condit 1969) to 1,500 (Sata         1944) to 1,600 (Krause 1953) to 2,000 (Merrill 1943).                    With such a large number of fig species, and the obvious disagreement         about classification within the genus, it would be expected that,         without fruit present, common fig trees would be hard to distinguish         from other Ficus app. However, its deciduous character and twig and leaf         characteristics make the common fig readily identifiable when using the         keys devised by Condit (1941, 1969).                                                History             of the Fig    Nutritional             Information    Recipes     Recipe             Submission               Packaging/Sales                 Contact             Us    Email       Fig             Advisory Board    Home              "
