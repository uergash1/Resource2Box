PURPOSE           This regulation            describes Department policy on the payment of publicÊ transportation            incentives and provides the guidelines within which mission areas and            staff offices may authorize payment to employees for the use of qualifying            mass transit.             2. SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS           This regulation            concerns employee benefits and budget planning. No additional funding            is available to the transit incentive. Mission areas and staff offices            will therefore need to review their budgets carefully taking into consideration            all funding needs. Highest priority should be placed on avoiding furlough            and reduction in force.             3. AUTHORITY           This regulation            is issued pursuant to the Federal Employees Clean Air Incentive Act            of 1993, Public Law 103-172, dated December 2, 1993, and the Transportation            Equity Act for the 21st Century, Public Law 105-178, dated June 9, 1998.           4. COVERAGE            This regulation            covers all employees as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2105 employed by the U.S.            Department of Agriculture.            Subcabinet Officials            may approve the use of the transit incentive for their organizations.            This decision may be further delegated to Agency Administrators. This            incentive may be offered in several variations:                        Benefits              in Addition to Compensation: Under this option employees may be given              financial incentives of up to $65 per month, or the actual commute              cost, whichever is less, in addition to their urrent compensation.              This amount, which is nontaxable, is indexed for inflation, and may              be increased to $100 per month after December 31, 2001.             Benefits in Lieu              of Compensation: USDA employees are permitted to set aside up to the              Federal nontaxable limit (see above) or the actual commute cost, whichever              is less, of their gross income before taxes are computed, to pay for              qualifying transit. Mission areas/agencies/staff offices do not pay              for this benefit. (This benefit is not currently available. The National              Finance Center (NFC) must modify the personnel/payroll system to accommodate              the in lieu of compensation benefit.Ê NFC will notify all users when              programming changes are complete.)             Combination:              Subcabinet Officials can give their employees part of the commuting              expense tax-free in addition to their compensation and allow compensation              to pay the remaining amount, up to the total monthly limit. (See note              in above paragraph regarding NFC system modification).             Consistency:              At a minimum, there must be consistent administration of the transit              incentive programÊ within an agency and it must take into consideration              the following elements:                                Responsible                  official(s). Subcabinet Officials will identify an official responsible                  for implementation and operation of the program, if administration                  is not further delegated to the agency level. If administration                  of the program is further delegated, Agency Administrators will                  identify the responsible official. Prior to extending the transit                  incentive to employees, mission areas/agencies or staff offices                  are to provide the Assistant Secretary for Administration with                  an implementation plan, including projected costs and point of                  contact for record purposes.                 Eligible                  employees. Subcabinet Officials or Agency Administrators will                  identify the employees who may receive the transit incentive.                  All applicants will be verified for eligibility. They may not                  be employees who received Federal motor vehicle parking benefits,                  and they must agree to use qualified transit for their regular                  daily commute. All participants shall present USDA ID cards and                  be recertified (quarterly or monthly, depending how frequently                  fare media are distributed) to ensure they are still eligible                  and are receiving only one benefit per month.                 Qualifying                  transit: Public transportation or mass transit and certain van                  pools are qualified methods of transit. Qualifying van pools or                  commuter highway vehicles must have a seating capacity of at least                  6 adults, not including the driver, and at least 80 percent of                  the mileage use must be for transporting employees in connection                  with travel between their homes and places of employment.                  Notification                  of availability: Mission areas/agencies and staff offices will                  notify employees of the availability of the transit incentive.                 Obtaining                  the transit incentive. Mission areas/agencies and staff offices                  will inform employees of procedures for applying for the transit                  incentive and will designate a headquarters office contact to                  review proposed transit benefit programs in field locations and                  oversee operation of field programs. Cash reimbursements shall                  not be used if a voucher or a transit pass is readily available                  for direct distribution to employees. Fare media (e.g., Metro                  checks) are to be used only for the commute to and/or from work.                  Giving and selling fare media to others, or purchasing fare media                  from another individual, is prohibited.                                       Records. Mission              areas/staff offices must maintain records to ensure recording of and              accounting for expenditures to facilitate preparation of reports.              All fare media shall be ordered, verified, stored, dispensed, balanced,              and recorded in a manner that ensures protection against loss and              maintains records of transactions.             Reports. Participating              mission areas/staff offices will be required to submit a report each              fiscal year to the Assistant Secretary for Administration by October              31. Report specifications will be provided by the Office of Human              Resources Management.             Effective date.              The effective date is the date of this regulation.                                  Home             |  USDA  |  Office            of Human Resources Management

REPLACEMENT HIGHLIGHTS   This Directive replaces GIPSA Directive 4060.2, Transit Incentive Program, dated 6/1/00.      4.  BACKGROUND   The 1998 Transportation Equity Act allows employers to provide transit incentives to cover part of their employees' transportation costs. Two incentives were offered: the tax set-aside and the direct subsidy (""transit voucher""). E.O. 13150 mandated that by October 1, 2000, agencies provide transit subsidies to employees who commute via mass transit or qualified vanpools.   At a minimum, agencies must offer headquarters employees an agency-paid subsidy and field employees a pre-tax benefit. Agencies may also offer a pre-tax parking benefit to those employees who drive, and then park their cars in order to take mass transit and/or a vanpool as part of their daily commute to/from work. The program is meant to improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion.        5.  POLICY      MRP encourages employees to commute to work by other than single occupant vehicles.

Only MRP employees who are not receiving a Federal parking benefit may participate in the transit incentive program.    Participation is limited to employees who agree to use public transportation or a qualifying vanpool for their regular daily commute to/from work.    Employees will not give or sell transit passes to others or purchase fare media from other Federal employees.           6.  FALSE RECORDS   Employees who make false certifications or fail to re-certify their application for benefits quarterly, or whenever necessary, may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including removal from Federal service.

GX067-87-3134625	"USDA NEWS                                                             VOLUME 58 NO. 7 — September 1999       Using Public Transit Can Put Cash Back In Our Pockets      Subways Qualify; Car Pools Don't        by Ron Hall, Office of Communications   Since December 1998 USDA agencies have had the option to participate in a ""transit incentive"" program, designed to encourage employees at headquarters and field offices to use public transportation. And since certain tax-related questions have recently been resolved, participating agencies now have an additional form of participation to choose, if they wish to pursue it.      In Departmental Regulation No. 4060-2 dated December 15, 1998, and titled ""Transit Incentives,"" USDA outlined its new policy on authorizing monetary incentives to employees who use qualifying forms of public transportation to commute to and from their USDA workplace.    The regulation noted that USDA's subcabinet officials have the option of approving the use of transit incentives for their organizations, and can delegate that decision to agency administrators. But it said ""No additional funding is available to pay the transit incentive.""    ""Mission areas and staff offices will therefore need to review their budgets carefully taking into consideration all funding needs,"" the regulation advised. ""Highest priority should be placed on avoiding furlough and reduction in force.""    Elizabeth Daly , a personnel management specialist in the Office of Human Resources Management, explained that ‘public' or ‘mass' transportation covered under USDA's regulation includes travel by bus, subway, train, and ferry boats. In addition, van pools qualify if they include at least six adult passengers plus the driver, and at least 80 percent of the van's mileage is for transporting employees between their homes and places of work. Car pools, irrespective of size, do not qualify.    She said that USDA's new regulation reflects a change in the Department's position on this issue. Public Law 101-509, which was signed into law on November 5, 1990, allowed--but did not require--federal departments to participate in programs to encourage use of public transportation. ""But then--as now--no additional funds were appropriated to pay for the cost incentives,"" she said.    USDA officials subsequently reviewed the matter but, citing budgetary reasons, opted in March 1992 to not participate as a Department in such a program. The May 1992 issue of the  USDA News  carried a story about that decision.    Then in 1997, based on an agreement between the Foreign Agricultural Service and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Union, FAS employees at GS-10 and below were allowed to participate in a transit incentive program.    According to  Gloria Abbott , an FAS budget analyst who administers the program, FAS employees who qualified could receive a ""Metrochek""--that is, an actual subway card--worth up to $25 a month tax free. Riders who use forms of public transportation other than subway could turn that subway card into a local public transportation office and exchange it for a ‘fare medium' such as bus passes or tokens or vouchers for other accepted forms of public transportation. The maximum amount has since increased to $30 a month tax free for qualifying FAS employees, and FAS's program has since expanded to cover GS-11 employees too.    Later that same year, following an office move to a more congested part of downtown Washington, DC, Economic Research Service Administrator  Susan Offutt  adopted a transit subsidy program for ERS employees, all of whom work in Washington, DC.    ""The increased congestion, high cost of parking, and excellent access to public transportation made the transit subsidy a particularly attractive option,"" explained  Vicki Smith , assistant to the ERS administrator and coordinator of that agency's program when it began.    ERS's subsidy also relies on the ""Metrochek"" plan, but its maximum reimbursement is $65 monthly tax free for its employees who use qualifying forms of mass transit.    In 1998 USDA officials decided to review the Department's earlier decision in 1992 that it would not participate, as a Department, in transit incentives. Departmental Regulation No. 4060-2 resulted from that review.    Daly explained that USDA agencies which elect to participate in some form of transit incentive have three basic options, as follows:      Benefits in Addition to Compensation --Under this option, the benefit provided to USDA employees is in some form of actual ‘Metrochek-like' subway card, bus pass or token, or some form of voucher, up to $65 per month tax free. This is provided in addition to--but is not included in--an employee's paycheck.        Benefits in Lieu of Compensation- -Under this option, USDA employees are permitted to ""set aside up to the federal nontaxable limit...or the actual commute cost, whichever is less, of their gross income before taxes are computed, to pay for qualifying transit."" USDA agencies do not pay for this benefit.    And just what does all that language mean? ""Under this option,"" Daly advised, ""employees are, in effect, sheltering a portion of their income from taxes--and it is equal to the amount they pay monthly in mass transit costs, subject to the $65 ceiling.""     She added that this option is similar to how an employee's Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) contributions are treated for tax purposes. As with the TSP, this transaction is reflected on an employee's Statement of Earnings and Leave.     In June 1999 the National Finance Center in New Orleans developed a procedure to accommodate this option.     Combination- -Under this option, USDA employees may receive a ‘Metrochek-like' form of reimbursement, as described in the first option above,  plus  a ‘Thrift Savings Plan-like' tax shelter, as described in the second option above--all not to exceed the $65 monthly ceiling.    USDA agencies which opt to participate in some form of transit incentive are responsible for setting up their own programs, identifying a point of contact, and maintaining appropriate records of its expenditures. ""     So far in 1999 we've seen increased use of these options by our headquarters employees who qualify and whose agencies are participating,"" Daly noted. ""We encourage similarly qualified field employees to consider these options as well.""                Inside the  ""USDA NEWS""      News and Current Information   Past Issues      USDA's ...

GX042-40-5075182	"UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR  BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT  WASHINGTON, D.C.  20240      November 1, 2001      In Reply Refer To:  1400-990 (WO-710)P      EMS TRANSMISSION 11/01/01  Instruction Memorandum No. 2002-023  Expires: 09/30/03           To:               All BLM Employees               From:     Assistant Director, Human Resources Management                Subject:     Public Transportation Benefit Program                                            DD: 11/15/01              Program Area:   Human Resources Management, Quality of Worklife Programs       Purpose:   This Instruction Memorandum (IM) provides updated information on the Public Transportation Benefit Program.  Employees must submit a new application in order to continue to participate in the program or to newly join the program.        Policy/Action:        Employees Currently Participating in the Program.   Currently, employees are eligible to receive up to a maximum of $65.00 per month to cover commuting expenses.  In January 2002, the transit benefit will increase to a maximum of $100 per month.  As a result of this increase, it is necessary for employees to reapply for the program.   It is important to understand that if you do not re-apply, you will be dropped from the program and will not receive any transit benefit for the period (January through March 2002).   All applications must be received by your Public Transportation Benefit Program Coordinator (Attachment 1) by November 15, 2001.  Only the most recent version of the application form will be accepted and processed.  The application form is available on the Department of Interior website at  http://www.doi.gov/pfm/travel.html .  Should you not have internet access, please contact your program coordinator.  Other than the increase in the transit subsidy, the program for this group of employees will operate as it has in the past.              (B) Employees Interested in Participating in the Program.   In October 2000, the Public Transportation Benefit Program was implemented in the Department of the Interior with the continued assistance from the Department of Transportation (DOT).  The program encourages employees to use mass transit for commuting to and from work by offering a financial incentive.  The transit benefit is used to cover ""qualifying transportation expenses"".  Qualifying transportation expenses include: (1) the use of mass transit facilities (subway, rail, bus) or other similar public transportation mode; and (2) the use of ""Commuter Highway Vehicle"" (having a seating capacity of at least 6 adults (not including the driver) and which is used for transporting employees to and from work for at least 80% of the mileage).  Van pools would typically satisfy the criteria for vehicles of this type, while car pools would not.  Additional information on this program can be found on the above website.  The website also contains a question and answer section.  If you decide to participate in the program, please submit your application to your local coordinator by November 15, 2001.        Updated Information:  The Department of Transportation (DOT) began a phased-in implementation of all Department of the Interior (DOI) field locations in January 2001.  Many programs are now established and running effectively.  DOT began with those locations that had the highest population of applicants and are now reviewing the remaining locations to determine how they can best be serviced.  Many DOI sites have unique circumstances that prevent DOT from setting up cost-effective programs at this time.  Employees in some BLM locations utilize qualified vanpools, buses, or other forms of mass transit each with different procedures, rate structures, and ticketing systems.  In many cases, DOT does not have existing contracts established with these companies.  In other locations, there is such a limited number of participants that servicing them through DOT would be cost prohibitive.      It is estimated that only a small number of employees are in the type of situation described above.  If you are unsure as to whether your vanpool/bus company, etc., has an established contract with DOT, please check with your local coordinator or Debbie Esposito, WO-710, on (202) 208-4695.  If it is determined that DOT cannot purchase vouchers/passes for you, the use of the SF-1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, has been approved for use effective December 2001.           Procedures for Reimbursement Using the SF-1164:       Participants must have submitted an application through their Public Transportation Benefit Program Coordinator.     Participants will purchase tickets/passes up-front with his/her own funds.  The participant is to retain and maintain receipts and/or cancelled checks to document payment.    Once three months of tickets/passes have been purchased, the participant can complete the SF-1164.  The SF-1164 will be filed at the end of the quarter and will be processed through normal channels.            The participant will complete information in Blocks 1, 4(a), (b), and (c), and (d), 6, 7, 8, 10, and the Accounting Classification at the bottom of the form.  Block 6 must state the employee is seeking reimbursement under the Public Transportation Benefit Program.  The form must include the method of transportation, the period for which the employee is seeking reimbursement, and the amount of the reimbursement.               Under Block 6, Expenditures, include Code C for ""Other Expenses"".          Annotate the months being claimed for the transit subsidy and the total amount claimed  for tickets/passes.  The amount claimed should be the actual amount spent up to $100 per month ($300.00 quarterly).            Attach applicable receipts/supporting documentation to justify claim.         The SF-1164 should be submitted through regular channels for approval.  Once signed, it should be sent to the National Business Center, Accounts Payable Branch, BC-622, for processing.       Timeframe:    Employees must submit their application to their local coordinator on or before Thursday, November 15, 2001.       Budget Impact:  Transit benefit for employees will increase from $65.00 per month up to $100 per month, not to exceed an employee's actual commuting costs.  Budget impact has been coordinated with WO-880.          Background:  The amount of the transit subsidy will be increasing in January 2002.  Employees must be notified of this increase and the need to submit a new application for the program.        Manual/Handbook Sections Affected:  This IM does not affect any manual or handbook.       Coordination:  This document was coordinated with the Budget Group (WO-800) and the National Business Center (BC-650).

Back to 4060 Table of Contents                 Am I Eligible for a Transit Incentive?    You are eligible for this program if you are a current USDA, MRP employee (headquarters or field) and you use public transportation or a registered vanpool for at least 50% of your regular monthly commuting trips to/from work (e.g., you are normally scheduled to work in Riverdale 15 days and at home 5 days per month. Fifteen days is considered 100% of your regular monthly commute. To meet the 50% requirement, you would have to commute via public transportation or registered vanpool at least 8 or more days per month; anything less [due to TDY, leave, etc.] would make you ineligible for benefits for that month. You must return vouchers in any month that this occurs).          Part-Time, Intermittent, and Stay-in-School Employees    If you fall under any of these categories, you are eligible to participate in this program for the days you work for MRP and use public transportation and/or a registered vanpool to commute to/from work.   Remember, you still must use public transportation or a registered van- pool at least 50% of the time.          Is my Vanpool Eligible?    To be eligible for this program, your vanpool must be registered with your local transit authority. If your vanpool is not registered, contact your local transit authority to find out how.   Headquarters employees can register and/or check if their vanpool is already registered by contacting the Washington Metropolitian Area Transit Authority ( www.wmata.com ).          Are Carpools Eligible?    Carpools are not eligible for this program. The program targets single occupancy vehicles and encourages those riders to convert to either mass transit or vanpools. The Government's goal is to ease traffic congestion and improve air quality.          Are Vanpool Owners and Drivers Eligible?    As a vanpool owner or driver you may claim costs if you actually pay to ride in the vanpool and can provide evidence of such payments if requested (e.g., a canceled personal check payable to your vanpool company).   Note : Vanpool owners are solely accountable to the IRS in the event of any audit.             Previous Section  |  Back to Top  |  Next Section   Return to 4060 Table of Contents     Last Updated 01-13-03                                               Inside            APHIS  -  USDA  -  APHIS             -  MRP  -  AMS             -  GIPSA                          Info/Site            Maps  -  Comments/Contact            the WebMaster  -  Disclaimer/Privacy            Statement

Introduction         The following directive provides information and guidance regarding NIH policies and     procedures pertaining to official travel, its authorization and performance, and     submission of claims for reimbursement of expenses. It is intended to assist  civilian     employees  who are required to travel in the performance of their duties, as     well as personnel responsible for the administration of travel regulations.       NOTE:    Rules and regulations in this directive will address     the majoritiy of official Government Travel subjects including sponsored travel.       There are, however, other topics such as payment of expenses connected with the illness or     death of a traveler, invitational travel, and certain relocation allowances that affect     relatively few travel assignments.  If these situations arise, contact your     Administrative Officer for guidance 1 .       Further, although Commissioned Officer (C.O.) travel is outlined in the Joint     Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), certain areas of travel in this Issuance contain the     same policies and procedures referenced in the JFTR ( Web site:    http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/jftr.html ).       Therefore, some Chapters in this Manual will specifically address C.O. travel     requirements and entitlements.         Official Government Travel is either related to:          Temporary duty away from the official duty station (TDY),                 A change of official duty station, a ""relocation"" which entails a Permanent         Change of Station (PCS), or                  Local travel in and around the official duty station.             It is essential that the employee’s travel is authorized with a written or     electronically generated form (Administrative Database (ADB) system) HHS-1 Travel Order     providing sufficient funds for the expenses that will be incurred.  In all cases,     travelers are expected to exercise the same care in spending public funds that a prudent     person would exercise when traveling on personal business.       1   Certain travel authorizations for  non-Federal employees      and relocation service allowances for  non-Federal employees  and     Commissioned Officers of the PHS are outlined in NIH Manual Issuance Chapter 1500-09-00 ( pending     release ).  Provisions pertaining to payment by the Government of expenses in     connection with the death of certain employees and/or their immediate family members are     outlined in FTR Chapter 303 and further detailed in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations     of Authority,  Travel #8 .        B. Authority       The following written authorities are cited as reference points for this directive on     policies and procedures: 31 U.S.C. 1353, 5 U.S.C. 5701  B      5709, 40 U.S.C. 486(c), and the Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) contained in Title 41,     Subtitle F, of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). In cases where NIH directives are     inconsistent with governing promulgations and in cases where there are omissions from the     directives, the governing regulations will normally prevail. Such decisions will rest with     the Director, Office of Financial Management (OFM), NIH.       C. Delegations of Authority       Appropriate delegations of authority at the National Institutes of Health are those     which are published in NIH Manual Issuance  1130  under     ""Travel"". These delegations are also defined in NIH Manual Issuance 1500 Chapter     01-02  C(9)  and  C(10) .       NOTE:  (This Manual Issuance can be accessed on the Web at:  http://www1.od.nih.gov/oma/manualchapters/ )       D.

General             This part of the directive identifies some of the ethical issues              related to travel with which NIH employees may be faced. It also provides              guidance that should be followed in certain situations. Each employee              is responsible for complying with the ethical standards required of              Federal employees in general and of NIH employees in particular. NIH              employees must maintain the highest degree of integrity.                                 B. Authority             Statutory and regulatory authorities related to this area are numerous and     promulgated by Congress, the Comptroller General, the General Services Administration, and     the Office of Government Ethics.                             C. Guidance       The NIH has the statutory authority to accept gifts donated to the Gift Trust Funds     from donors who wish to support the mission of biomedical research under the Public Health     Service (PHS) Act, Sections 231, 301, 405, and 497. The Gift Funds include the     Unconditional Gift Fund, the Conditional Gift Fund, (See NIH Manual Issuance 1500 Chapter     10-00 (C)) Patient’s Benefit Fund  (pending release) .             NIH employees, however, may not accept gifts or donations in conjunction              with travel related situations. Reimbursements offered to employees              to defray either general or specific expenses associated with travel              or transportation are considered to be offers of gifts or donations,              and according to numerous Comptroller General (C.G.) decisions, are              strictly prohibited except as described in 5 U.S.C 4111, 31 U.S.C.              1353, 42 U.S.C. 3506, and 5 U.S.C. 7342 (See NIH Manual Issuance 1500              Chapter 08 ""Acceptance of Payment from Non-Federal Sources to              Cover Travel Expenses"")  (pending release) .                     Private (Nonfederal) Source Contributions . Private source contributions         for travel are supplements to the salary or expenses of Federal employees, and are         improper for two reasons. First, they are prohibited by Title18 U.S.C. 209. Under this         statute, both the giving and the receiving are criminal offenses. Secondly, they are         improper as unauthorized augmentations. To the extent the contribution supplements the         Government salary or other expenditure, including travel associated costs, it is an         augmentation in an indirect sense, the theory being that when Congress appropriates money         for an activity, all expenses of that activity must be borne by that appropriation unless         Congress specifically provides otherwise.                     Exceptions to Private (Nonfederal) Source Contributions .  Under 5 U.S.C.         4111, enacted as part of the Government Employee Training Act, an employee may accept 1)         contributions and awards incident to training in non-Government facilities and 2) payment         of travel, subsistence, and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, but  only         if the donor is a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization . Under legislative authorities 31         U.S.C. 1353, 42 U.S.C. 3506, and 5 U.S.C. 7342, with limited conditions an employee may         accept payment of travel, subsistence, and other related expenses incident to attendance         at meetings and similar functions; in the performance of advisory services; or when         traveling to conduct official duties on behalf of the United States on funding provided by         a foreign government (including international or multinational organizations).  Under 31         U.S.C. 1353, employees and their spouses are prohibited from accepting cash or checks made         payable to the employee and/or the spouse from a non-Federal source for travel or         attendance at  meetings or similar functions.  Cash may still be received and         retained by the employee under the authority to provide advisory services (42 U.S.C. 3506)         or to accept sponsorship under the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act (5 U.S.C. 7342);         however, in this case, the employee is advised to submit the payment to his/her         administrative official for deposit to the appropriation in the most expeditious manner.         NIH personnel vouchering trips for sponsored travel should consult NIH Manual Issuance         1500 Chapter 08  (pending release)  for the directions and proper handling of checks         made payable to the individual traveler. If an employee receives a contribution in cash or         in kind under this section, his/her travel and subsistence allowances must be         appropriately reduced.           The above policies apply to reimbursements for travel performed by NIH employees for         official purposes only. Travel performed incident to ""outside work or         activities"" is contained in NIH Manual Issuance Chapter 2300-735-4, and must be         submitted on a HHS-520 Form ""Request for Approval of Outside Activities.""                 Donations . When made to an employee under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 4111         with the express condition that they be used for an unauthorized purpose they should be         returned to the donor (47 C.G. 319, 1967).                     Retention of Promotional Benefits.  Any promotional         benefit or material received from a travel service provider in         connection with official travel may be retained for personal use by the         employee, as long as such items are obtained under the same conditions         as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the         Government (FTR 301-53.2).                     Denied Boarding  (involuntary bumping) compensation is payable to the         Government,  not  to the individual employee. Since this is not         considered a gift or a promotional item, but is more in         the nature of damages, it is deposited into miscellaneous receipts (See FTR 301-10.116).          NOTE:   Should the traveler receive a benefit, i.e., check         for airfare, the traveler must ensure that the carrier shows the         ""Treasurer of the United States"" as the payee on the         compensation check. The traveler must forward the check immediately to         his/her Administrative Officer (AO) who, in turn, must submit the check         to the OFM Travel, Fellowships and Cashiers Office in Building 31.          Any benefit, i.e., coupon received from the carrier for meals and/or         lodging must be deducted from the traveler's per diem allowance.  However, where the  employee voluntarily vacates his/her seat  and takes a later         flight, he/she may retain overbooking compensation received from the airlines, subject to         offset for any additional travel expenses caused by the voluntary action. (59         C.G. 203,         1980). (For additional guidance, see FTR 301-10.117).                     C onditions of Non-acceptance of Travel Expenses.  Unless authorized         pursuant to an exception, an employee may not accept travel expenses from a prohibited         source.                     A prohibited source means any person who:                                               Is seeking official action by the employee’s agency;                Does business or seeks to do business with the employee’s agency;                Conducts activities regulated by the employee’s agency;                Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or non-performance               of the employee’s official duties; or                Is an organization, a majority of whose members are described in a-d above (5 C.F.R.               2635.203 (d)).                                                             D. NIH Procedures for Acceptance of Nonfederal Source Funds                     Nonfederal source approval.  All offers of payment of official travel         expenses from non-Federal sources must be approved  in advance  and  in writing ,         by the appropriate official (See NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations of Authority,  Travel         # 7 ), prior to acceptance. This will help to provide consistency of interpretation of         applicable statutes and regulations. Administrators are responsible for ensuring all         agency personnel are made aware that such offers must be so approved. This is especially         important for those responsible for approving travel.                     Acceptance of expenses from nonfederal sources.  Travel orders should note         specifically what expenses are being accepted by the traveling employee and under what         authority. The traveling employee will never approve the acceptance of his/her own travel         expenses.                     Record of nonfederal expenses.  A record of all travel expenses accepted         from non-Federal funding will be kept by the Office of Financial Management in a central         file. (For additional information on this subject matter see NIH Manual Issuance 1500         Chapter 08)  (pending release).             1500-01-02 Authorization and Approval of Official Travel                            A. General                     Authorizing Officials  - Following is a list of NIH officials with specific         delegation to authorize and/or approve travel documents  (See Items C(9) and C(10)) .         While some travel-related documents are prepared manually, for the majority of domestic,         foreign, and local travel, the NIH requires the use of the electronic travel orders and         vouchers available on the Administrative Database (ADB) system.                              Automated Travel System Directions: NIH Web Site ""User Guides"" for ADB  -          To initiate and approve travel documents on the ADB, users are required to be properly         trained in travel procedures. Each user must be assigned a set of "" identification""         initials  by his/her Administrative Office. These initials, in conjunction with a         selected ""keyword"", allow access to the ADB. Comprehensive travel courses are         available through the NIH’s Division of Workforce Development (DWD) (Training Center)         and additional information may be obtained from the ADB ""User Guides"" (Domestic,         Foreign, and Local). These guides may be accessed on the following web site:  http://www-isb.cit.nih.gov/dbasdocs.htm .                                  B. Authority                   The FTR requires that the head of an agency authorize or approve all travel. The     FTR allows for the re-delegation of this authority. The approval process of all vouchers     for payment is authorized by Title 31 U.S.C. 3528 ( See Federal Travel Regulations CFR  301-71.203 ).                            C. Delegations of Authority                   The Deputy Director for Management, NIH, is delegated the responsibility of     maintaining the Agency’s authorization and approval system and is particularly     responsible for ensuring compliance with all aspects of the system by Agency employees.     (See NIH Manual Issuance  1130  - Delegations of Authority, Travel).         Authorizations (Travel Orders) and related funding documentation.          The NIH administrative officials listed below ( Item C(9) ) and  C(10) )         have been delegated specific responsibilities for the authorization and/or approval of         travel related documents. These officials review and assess the appropriateness of the         trip, the method of transportation used, the cost estimates set forth for per diem and         travel expenses, and the availability of funds for payment to the traveler.                     Funds available.  Most Federal appropriations that are used to         fund travel are approved on a  fiscal year (FY)  schedule ( October         1 of the current calendar year to September 30 of the coming calendar year ). When         the United States Congress and the President pass the Federal Budget  on or before          October 1 of the current year, monies authorized and obligated for travel purposes  on         or after  the October 1 date are made available.                       Funding from multiple CANs.  Because the NIH workforce is made         up of Federal Civil Service employees, Commissioned Officers of the USPHS, appointees,         fellows, and trainees, their travel funding may be obligated from more than a single         appropriation or CAN. The account used depends upon the employment category of the         employee doing the travel. Although, most of these funds are renewed on a fiscal year         basis, some funds are approved for multiple years and are not affected by the September 30         FY deadline. (Item (7) below.)                      Suspension of Federal funding.  When the United States Congress and the         President  do not  sign the new fiscal year budget or approve a ""continuing         resolution"" (CR) by October 1 of the current year, the Federal Agencies are deemed         ""out of funds"" and must be shut down. All Federal employees,  including         travelers , are ""furloughed.""                     Travel not funded.  When travelers submit authorizations (Travel Orders)         for periods of travel that span both fiscal years (e.g. September 23  B  October 5), approving officials must ensure that the         authorization contains the qualifying statement, "" Subject to the Availability of         Funding"".  This commits only monies from the current FY travel budget, not monies         from the new FY budget that may not be approved.  Travelers should be advised that if         the Federal Budget is not signed and a continuing resolution is not authorized to         temporarily fund the Government, they are expected to return to their permanent duty         station by  midnight September 30 . All expenses incurred after this deadline cannot         be claimed by the traveler or reimbursed by the Government.                     Continuing resolution (CR).  When the United States Congress and the         President do not sign a new fiscal year budget, the President has the option of signing a         ""continuing resolution"". This piece of legislation allows "" emergency         funding""  for Government agencies to continue running for a  limited number of         days  beyond the September 30 midnight deadline. Travel activities may take place         during the continuing resolution period, and expenses are reimbursable.                      Appropriations not affected by the FY date.  Trips authorized from funds         that are not dependent upon the fiscal year renewal date (referenced in item (3) above)         may continue in travel status, and traveler’s expenses are fully reimbursable.                     New FY budget approved.  When the United States Congress and the President         sign the new fiscal year Federal Budget on or before October 1, all travel expenses are         covered. If the employee is in travel status during a period of time that spans both         fiscal years, he/she will be reimbursed for all travel expenses which were incurred before         midnight September 30 from the current FY budget, and reimbursed for all travel expenses         which were incurred after 12:01 a.m. October 1 from the new FY budget.                                   Travel Orders and Vouchers will be prepared accordingly reimbursing                from both appropriations.                              Authorizing Officials - Travel Orders and pre-travel                documents.                                                  NIH Director  may authorize travel for all personnel at                  the NIH.                 The delegation of  authority for foreign travel  for all                  employees of their respective institutes or centers can be referenced                  in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations of Authority,  Travel #9 .                 Delegated  Administrative Officials designated as ""funding                  officials""  authorize domestic travel and approve funding                  for domestic and foreign travel for employees in their IC over-site                  areas.                 The  ""recommending official""  signs travel documents                  for all employees directly under their  supervision                   and, in cases where re-delegation has been authorized, may also                   approve   domestic travel orders  for employees                  under their supervision.                  Budget Officers  who oversee ""management funding""                  in the NIH Clinical Center, authorize both domestic and foreign                  travel orders with approvals at the Administrative and Director’s                  Offices respectively.                 For signature approval for  Actual Expense Allowance (AEA)                  justifications , reference NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #1 .                 The delegation of authority for accepting  payment from a                  nonfederal source  to cover travel-related expenses in cash                  or in kind can be referenced in NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #7 .                 For signature approval for  Non-contract air carriers                   and  Foreign air carrier  usage, reference NIH Manual Issuance                  1130 Delegations of Authority,  Travel                  #14 .                  For signature approval for  Premium Class  travel accommodations,                  for travelers with a disability, special needs, or individual                  justification, reference NIH Manual Issuance 1130 Delegations                  of Authority,  Travel                  #15 .                                  NOTE: Under the current delegations of authority, IC Directors/Deputy                  Directors/Executive Officers have equal delegated authority and                  may authorize and approve travel for each other. For travel that                  requires the signature of a ""Recommending Official"",                  that individual may be either the IC Executive Officer or equivalent                  level or someone who is at the same or higher supervisory level                  than the traveler. In all such cases, these authorities are to                  be retained at the highest administrative level necessary to ensure                  program integrity.                                                             Approval of travel reimbursement claims (Travel                Vouchers) .  Following are the officials with delegated authority                to approve Travel vouchers, including those items requiring specific                approval before reimbursement can be made:                               NIH Delegated  Administrative Officials  who have signature certification for           funding, approve all Travel Vouchers for their respective Institute or Center areas.           Budget Officers  in the NIH Clinical Center approve voucher payments with an           additional Administrative Officer authorizing signature.           The one  exception  to the above rules is the approval of  ""cash""            (use of personal credit cards, personal checks, money orders, etc.) to purchase emergency           or non-emergency transportation tickets costing  over $100  from traveler’s           personal funds. The appropriate official must make the final decision for authorizing           reimbursement of all, part or none of the ticketed amount  before  funding approval           can be finalized and payment issued (See NIH Manual Issuance 1130 - Delegations of           Authority,  Travel #12 ).                                                            NIH"

The President asked Vice President Gore to oversee this effort.   The Office of Personnel Management Welfare to Work web pages provide guidance regarding hiring authorities available for use in the efforts of Executive Departments and Agencies to provide employment opportunities for welfare recipients.    In his March 8, 1997, memorandum, President Clinton identified the  Worker-Trainee Program  as an option agencies can use to hire people off the welfare rolls.  To provide you with updated information on this program, we have included a description of the  programs background  as well as specifics relating to  current appointment provisions .    In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, federal agencies have many additional hiring options to consider.  Among them are permanent, temporary and term appointments in the  competitive service , as well as numerous  excepted service authorities .  These excepted service authorities include many that are agency-specific, and a number that are government-wide authorities.  These web pages describe the government-wide authorities most likely to be used for the Welfare to Work program.  In addition to the Worker-Trainee Program, there may be a number of welfare recipients who qualify for the appointment options requiring additional experience, education and/or military service.

Student interns are also encouraged to seek academic     credit for the internship experience with their college or university. This program also     provides permanent state employees an opportunity for new or enriched work experiences in a setting     different than their permanent job. Undergraduate Internships    are three to six     months in duration and Executive Fellowships    are one to two years in     duration.       The Governor's Internship Program strives to attract, develop, and ultimately, retain     highly capable program participants as state employees. Successful candidates who compete     for positions are individuals dedicated to excellence and are interested in     public service.        By attracting bright, talented and highly motivated students and state employees,     sponsoring agencies will gain valuable assistance and innovation from selected interns.     Program participants will receive work experience, hands-on training, and the opportunity     to observe the various roles and duties within state government. Participants are expected     to leave the program as competent, prepared, and experienced public sector employees whose     skills and talents can lead to a career in state government.
