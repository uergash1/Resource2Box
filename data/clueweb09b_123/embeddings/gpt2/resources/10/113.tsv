However, hunting licenses expire at the end of the calendar year. If  you plan to go afield after Dec. 31 for quail, rabbit, archery deer or other  pursuits, be sure to stop by a licensed dealer or department office and pick up  a new 2009 General Hunting license (class G).   For those who hunt and fish, the Combo Hunt and Fish license (class F) is the  best choice. It is cheaper than buying each license separately and it includes  your trout stamp.   Families with children between ages 14 and 18 can take advantage of the  Family Combo Hunt Fish license (class K) and save big. A family of four can hunt  small game (and other game, with appropriate tags) and fish in all state waters,  including trout, for less than $35 per family member. Add an Urban Fishing  license (class U) for everyone in the family and enjoy fishing at any of the 21  waters, stocked regularly, for your fishing pleasure.   Dedicated resident sportsmen cannot go wrong with the Super Conservation  Combo Hunt and Fish license (class N), which comes with more accessories than a  Swiss army knife. Not only do you get the general hunting and fishing license, a  trout stamp is included, as is the urban fishing license. Now the good stuff:  The package includes a dove stamp, a state duck stamp (the federal stamp must be  purchased separately), an over-the-counter archery deer tag (open units subject  to change), a fall archery turkey tag, a fall bear tag and a mountain lion tag.  The cost is only $163  a $50 savings. If you dont fish, just get the Super  Hunting License (class M) for $118, which is still a $37 savings.   In addition, new this year is the Apprentice Hunting License (class H). This  is a free two-day general hunting license for introducing someone new to  hunting. Designed as a try before you buy program, this license is obtained  from any Arizona Game and Fish Department office at no cost by a licensed adult  18 or older. This person takes on the role of mentor and takes an apprentice  (friend, family member, co-worker, or neighbor) out hunting for small game and  teaches them the basics of hunting. Mentors are an important component to  preserve the hunting heritage and to promote the conservation value that hunters  provide. For more information about the Apprentice Hunting License, see the  article in this issue.

It is the sequel to  Konami 's  Track & Field  and features seven all-new  Olympic  events. Like its predecessor,  Hyper Sports  featured two run buttons and one action button per player. This game is also known as  Hyper Olympic '84  outside North America.   While not quite achieving the commercial and critical success of  Track and Field ,  Hyper Sports  still proved to be very popular among gamers and, like its prequel, really came into its own as a highly addictive multi-player experience.     [ edit ]   Gameplay   The gameplay was much the same as  Track & Field  in that the player competes in an event and tries to score the most points based on performance criteria, and also by beating the computer entrants in that event. Also, the player tries to exceed a qualification time, distance or score in order to advance to the next event. In Hyper Sports, if all of the events were passed successfully, the player advances to the next round of the same events which are faster and harder to qualify for.   The events changed to include these new sports:     Freestyle swimming  - Swimming speed is controlled by two run buttons, and breathing is controlled by the action button when prompted by swimmer on screen. There is one re-do if a player fouls due to launching before the gun, but only one ""run"" at the qualifying time.       Skeet shooting  - Selecting left or right shot via the two run buttons while a clay-bird is in the  sight . There are three rounds to attempt to pass the qualifying score. If a perfect score is attained then a different pattern follows allowing for a higher score.       Vaulting horse  - Speed to run at horse is computer controlled, player jumps and pushes off horse via the action button, and rotates as many times as possible via run buttons (and tries to land straight up on feet). There are three attempts at the qualifying score.       Archery  - Firing of the arrow controlled by action button; the elevation angle is controlled by depressing the action button and releasing at the proper time. There are three attempts at passing the qualifying score.       Triple jump  - Speed is controlled by the run buttons, jump and angle are controlled by action button. There are three attempts at the qualifying distance, and player fouls if first jump is after the white line.       Weight lifting  - Power used to lift weights is controlled by run buttons, while shift of weight from lifting up to pushing above the head is controlled by action button. There are two attempts at the qualifying weight.       Pole vault  - Speed to run is preset by computer, while release of pole and body movement is controlled by the action button. Player continues attempting the increasing heights until he/she fouls out (by missing base at the bottom or by knocking off horizontal bar with body at the top). The third foul disqualifies the player.

clueweb09-en0007-27-31942	"     Documents Homepage  ::   World of Sports Science   ::  A-Ba (and timeline)          Archery              Archery is a sport that is among the oldest of recorded competitive activities. Cultures as diverse as the Chinese, indigenous North American peoples, and early Europeans placed value on the ability of men to skillfully use a bow and arrow. The legends of William Tell and Robin Hood centered upon the talent of each character to shoot an arrow with unerring accuracy. When archers were displaced in English armies through the development of firearms and cannon in the 1600s, archery gained popularity as a competitive sport.   Archery was introduced to the Olympics in 1900, and the sport was contested through the Games of 1920, when it was removed from the Olympic roster as a result of disputes among the competing nations regarding the appropriate rules for competition. Archery was reinstated to Olympic status at the Summer Games of 1972. Archery is also included at the Summer Paralympics as a wheelchair sport. As with the sports of the ancient Olympics that are still part of the modern games, archery is a sport that has not changed to a significant degree since medieval times.   FITA, the international archery federation, is the governing body for the sport worldwide. Modern archery is organized into men's and women's divisions, both as individual competitions and as team events. The usual international events require a competitor to deliver a prescribed number of arrows into a target from a variety of distances. For men, the distances are 30 m, 50 m, 70 m, and 90 m; for women, the maximum competitive distance is 70 m. The targets are divided into ten zones, with zone widths varying depending on the distance from which the archer shoots. The sport is very simple in its execution, as the archer with the most arrows delivered closest to the bulls' eye, the center of the target, is the winner. While physical strength and general fitness are important to an elite-level archery competitor, archery is a sport where physical size is not of primary importance.   As a machine, a bow is any stringed projectile weapon designed to shoot arrows. The modern bow used in archery competition is of the same approximate shape and dimension as the long bows first used by the English army at the Battle of Crecy in 1346 to defeat their French enemy. The modern bow is constructed from carbon fiber and other similar composite materials to create a maximum degree of response to the pull of the archer. The shooting of an arrow involves the application of a series of physical principles. The expression, ""translation of energy,"" is important in the understanding of how the arrow is delivered with maximum effect. As the archer prepares to draw back the bowstring, the potential energy available to the arrow rests in the muscles of the archer's arm and shoulders. Once the bowstring is drawn, the potential energy is transferred from the archer to the bowstring. When the bowstring is released, virtually all of the stored potential energy in the bowstring is transferred to become the kinetic energy that powers the arrow into flight.   The flight of the arrow is a product of a number of physical factors. The velocity at which the arrow is released, the angle (calculated as the number of degrees above horizontal that the bow and arrow are aimed), the mass of the arrow, and the impact of air resistance and wind all contribute to the manner in which the arrow will travel.   Archery is a deceptive sport in terms of the approach to physical training and fitness required of the competitive archer. The general desirable physical qualities in an archer are strength, particularly in the core strength elements of the abdominal, lumbar (lower back), and groin, to provide stability to the archer as the arrows are shot. Flexibility is also an important quality, as is muscular strength in the upper body, to effectively draw back and deliver the arrows.   Aerobic fitness and a corresponding ability to control the heart rate of the athlete in the stress of competition is of critical importance to the competitive archer. Aerobic fitness assists an archer in offsetting the fatigue that results from standing for several hours through a competition, where during the delivery of the arrows the athlete must be strong and physically prepared to compete. The high level of mental focus required to concentrate during every attempt at a target (the archer may deliver over 50 arrows in a single session) is best supported by a body that is fit.   Archers employ a variety of mental conditioning techniques to prepare themselves for an event. Many of these devices include both visualization of the physical movements that the archer will complete to shoot a perfect arrow; other techniques encourage the athlete to use imagery to relax prior to the event.    Archery is a deceptive sport in terms of the approach to physical training and fitness required of the competitive archer.    As a general proposition, the lower an archer's heart rate, the steadier the aim. The rate at which the heart beats is a function of the autonomic nervous system, which controls other involuntary systems such as respiration. Most competitive archers employ one of a variety of deep breathing techniques prior to the actual delivery of an arrow to take the pulse to its lowest possible rate to create the greatest degree of stability and control over the delivery of the arrow.

Posted on: 01/02/09 [ Comments? ]                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Effective Jan. 1, the Arizona Game and Fish Department is offering a new ""Apprentice Hunting License,"" at no charge, to encourage existing hunters to become mentors and introduce a friend, neighbor, relative, or co-worker to the traditions and importance of hunting.    The Apprentice License allows an already licensed hunter to take a beginner on an actual huntwithout the beginner having to buy a hunting license. The Apprentice License is free for residents and nonresidents and is valid for two consecutive days for the take of small game, fur-bearing, predatory and nongame mammals, nongame birds, and upland game birds. (To take migratory birds or waterfowl, the appropriate stamps are required at normal costs). The license is not valid for the take of big game.    Many people express an interest in hunting but are deterred either because of not knowing how to get started or the initial expense. The Apprentice Hunting License removes the initial cost barrier of having to buy a license (which costs between $26.50 and $151.25, depending on age and residency), so that newcomers can ""try before they buy.""    ""This will allow a seasoned hunter to take someone new under their wing and teach them the basics about hunting, firearm safety, and wildlife conservation without cost prohibitive burdens,"" said Chairman Bill McLean of the Arizona Game and Fish Commission. ""There are many states with this type of license, and it has become a model for removing barriers in the national effort to increase hunter participation.""    The Apprentice Hunting License is only available at Arizona Game and Fish Department offices. The mentor must be at least 18 years old and possess a valid hunting license and is limited to two Apprentice Hunting Licenses per calendar year. The license must be made out to the name of the apprentice, with the mentor's name associated with the license. The apprentice can only receive one license per calendar year. The mentor is required to be with the apprentice at all times while in the field, providing instruction and supervision on safe and ethical hunting.    ""Arizona's hunting heritage and wildlife management through the next generation,"" said Craig McMullen, Hunter Heritage Work Group team leader for the Arizona Game and Fish Department. ""Not only will this allow someone new to experience the thrill of the hunt, this also allows mentors to teach others about wildlife conservation and the important role that hunters, as conservationists play, in the management of all wildlife.""    ""Outside of getting new hunters in the field, safety is our number one concern. Hunting in Arizona is very safe, and we have one of the lowest accident rates in the United States,"" said Dave Williams, hunter education coordinator of the Arizona Game and Fish Department. ""A good mentor will instill the basics of wearing hunter orange and how to safely handle a firearm through T.A.B.+1: Treat every firearm as if it were loaded; Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction; Be sure of your target and beyond; and keep your finger outside of the trigger guard until you are ready to shoot. Nearly every hunting-related accident can be avoided by following these simple principles""    However, with the added flexibility comes added responsibility. Mentors need to set a good example to these impressionable new comers. Mentors should consider the following guidelines:         * Focus on the experience not the harvest       * Obey all laws       * Keep your apprentices physical limits in mind       * Be informative       * Teach field dressing and cooking       * Take pictures       * Plan a follow-up outing     Seasoned hunters can start the New Year giving. By introducing someone new to hunting, you are giving the gift of the American hunting heritage. Quail season runs until Feb. 8, 2009, cottontail rabbit season runs all year long and the both make excellent quarry (as well as, great table fare) for new hunters. A 2009 hunting license is required beginning Jan. 1, 2009.

Don't forget that Monday, Oct. 13 is a state holiday, Columbus Day, so the Game and Fish offices will be closed.    Arizona Game and Fish Department officials said the spring hunt application process is for javelina, bearded turkey, bear and buffalo. Don't forget, there is something new this coming spring - there are over-the-counter non-permit turkey tags for youth.    Department officials pointed out that it is once again a manual application process for the spring hunts - there is NO online application process available.    Spring hunt regulations should be available at all license dealers statewide, or stop by any of the seven Arizona Game and Fish Department offices in the state. The applications and regulations can also be downloaded from the Game and Fish Department's Web site at  www.azgfd.gov  . Don't miss out!    By the way, department biologists said the terrific green up last spring coupled with the abundant rainfall this summer should equate to a good year for javelina. The excellent mast crop in the high country this year bodes well for turkey populations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Southwest U.S. Forum Topics                                                                                                                              The  Southwest U.S. Forum  has  339 Active Topics                                                       New Mexico Makes Big Changes for 2009-10 ATV's durning Hunting season riverside and san bernadino county Unit 21 Archery Javelina Hunt Information Please                                                                                                                                                                  Visit                    the Forums                                                                    Photos and Stories                                                                                                                                                    Oregon Blacktail Buck Hunt                             We were walking back to the vehicles after a rainy day of hunting on the Oregon coast.

clueweb09-en0007-27-32254	"     Documents Homepage  ::   World of Sports Science   ::  Sc-Sp          Shooting              Shooting, also known as sport shooting has been a competitive sport in a variety of forms since the mid-1800s. Competitions that involved pursuits such big game hunting, target shooting, and the hunting of a wide variety of birds were all contested in various parts of the world. The first prominent organization created to advance the interest of serious sport shooters and marksmen was the National Rifle Association, formed in the United States in 1871.   Throughout its history as a competitive sport, shooting has encompassed many different types of firearms. ""Gun"" is a term used interchangeably with firearm. At its most basic, a firearm is any barreled device capable of discharging a projectile. By the time of the first modern Olympics in 1896, competitive shooting was conducted in separate divisions for three types of firearms; rifles, pistols, and shotguns. A rifle is a long barreled firearm that has spiral grooves machined along the interior of the barrel; the spiral grooves, or rifling, create a rotary motion when the bullet is fired. The spin imparted to the bullet by the rifling tends to produce a more accurate shot. A rifle is typically discharged from the shoulder position of the shooter. A pistol is small firearm designed to be held and discharged from a single hand of the shooter. Both pistols and rifles may be powered by the force of conventional gunpowder contained in the cartridge that contains the bullet to be fired. The explosive force of the gunpowder is initiated when the trigger on the firearm is pulled by the shooter. Other types of both pistols and rifles are powered by systems that employ either compressed air mechanisms or pressurized gases.   A shotgun has a long barrel, one typically shorter and thicker than that of a rifle. The inside of the shotgun barrel is smooth, as the projectiles discharged are not a single object, as with a rifle bullet, but are numerous tiny projectiles, referred to as ""shot"". Shotguns are not as accurate as either rifles or pistols, but are an effective device in covering a wider area with the discharged ammunition.   The International Sport Shooting Federation, ISSF, is the governing body for shooting competitions through out the world. There are 17 different categories of shooting recognized at the Olympic games, seven open to women and 10 restricted to male competitors. Until 1996, a number of shooting categories at the Olympics were designated as mixed events, open to competitors of either gender. In addition to the various types of rifle and pistol shooting where the marksman attempts to shoot at a distant target, there are two general classes of moving target competitions involving trap and skeet. The trap is a device that propels specially constructed clay targets into the air at a specified distance from the shooter. In Olympic competition, the shooter must attempt to shoot 125 of the targets, from a total of five different shooting positions. In the event called double trap, two clay targets are released simultaneously at differing angles, requiring the shooter to make successive shots on the targets.   Skeet is also an event involving shot guns. The shooters assume a series of positions during the competitions, attempting to strike the targets, sometime referred to as ""clay pigeons"" after they are propelled into the air.   Shooting also is an important element of a winter sports discipline, the biathlon, where the competitors complete a series of laps on a cross country ski course, with intervals in which the athletes are required to shoot at set targets with a rifle from both prone and standing positions. The combination of endurance, strength, and precise marksmanship, accomplished while the athlete attempts to steady their body from the rigors of skiing, make the biathlon one of the most difficult Winter Olympic sports.   As with many sports where muscle power is not a prerequisite, shooting appears deceptively simple.  Female athletes shooting air pistols as part of 2000 Olympic Games (pentathlon).  The ability to steady hand and mind to deliver a sequence of shots requires well-developed powers of concentration and emotional control. Elite shooters spend considerable training time developing skills in visualization, where they direct their mental powers to the entire sequence of a successful shot, as an aid in coordinating their physical and mental efforts.   The greater the level of physical fitness possessed by a competitive shooter, the more likely they are to achieve competitive success. Many shooters attempt to fire at a target between heartbeats, when the body is at its most stable. The more fit the athlete, generally, the lower the heart rate. A lower heart rate will provide the shooter with a greater window within which to deliver the shot. The breathing exercises that are often performed by shooters during competition to relax the body have a more pronounced effect on a body that has both a fit cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory system.   Shooting has known its share of performance enhancing drug concerns. The best known of the drugs used by shooters to relax themselves and potentially slow their heart rate are alcohol and beta blockers, both banned substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List. Beta block-ers are drugs used to treat a number of cardiovascular conditions; they have the effect of slowing heart rate and reducing blood pressure, an advantage in shooting.

Deerjack   Deer-jacked! Hunter is held up   November 28, 2006   ASSOCIATED PRESS   MEADVILLE, Pa. - Three men stole a hunter’s doe at gunpoint, the hunter said.   “I’m really, really upset about the whole ordeal,” said Robert Hanna, 42, of Meadville, Pa.. “(It’s) over a dumb deer. If they wanted it so bad I would have said, ‘Take it.’”   Hanna said he shot the deer on Monday afternoon and was getting ready to come down from his tree stand when he was approached by three men with rifles.   They ordered him to empty his rifle and throw his gun down and one of the men then knocked him to the ground, he said.   “It’s an armed robbery and an assault,” said Vernon Township Sgt. Randy Detzel. “They knocked him to the ground and took his deer.”   Police had no suspects.

First-come javelina hunt tags are still available   Looking for a great holiday gift idea? There are still several thousand javelina hunt-permit tags available for the spring 2007 hunts on a first-come, first-served basis by U.S. mail only from the Arizona Game and Fish Department.   To find out what hunts have javelina tags available, visit azgfd.gov/draw or call (602) 789-3702. Keep in mind that each work day, the number of permits remaining can dwindle as applications are received and processed.   Department officials stressed that those who apply for the leftover tags need to pay attention to the new increased fees for licenses and tags for 2007 on page two of the spring hunt regulation supplement.   Those applying for the first-come, first-served process might also keep in mind that there are super new license deals available for 2007, including a new family license, a super conservation hunting license (includes various tags and stamps), and a super conservation combination hunt/fish license, which are available at department offices.   As a side note, dont forget there is a change in the timing to apply for elk and antelope during the upcoming year: 2007 will be the first year the department conducts a winter draw, or lottery, for elk and antelope tags. The application deadline for elk and antelope is Feb. 13. Hunt permit-tags and refund warrants will be mailed out by April 27.   The department will begin accepting applications for elk and antelope as soon as the regulations are posted on the departments Web site at azgfd.gov. That posting should occur by the end of December. The printed regulations should be available at hunting license dealers by Jan. 12.

TUCSON, Ariz. — The Arizona Game and Fish Department is asking for the public’s help in finding a poacher that killed a mature mule deer buck and a fawn near Willcox on Nov. 11 or 12.   The deer were shot in Game Management Unit 32 in a hay field near Willcox. According to Wildlife Manager John Bacorn, both deer were found on Monday morning, Nov. 13, where they were left in the field to waste.   “We need help from the public in catching the poachers,” said Bacorn. “If you were in the area recently, please think back about anything you might have seen or heard or any conversations you might have had. Maybe someone doesn’t realize he or she has the key to solving this case.”   The poaching of these animals is considered a major loss for the residents of Arizona and our wildlife resources.   Anyone with information about this poaching can call the department’s Operation Game Thief hotline toll-free at (800) 352-0700. A quick report of any poaching case to the department is important, in order to preserve any evidence. Callers may be eligible for a reward, and all calls can remain confidential upon request.

If you don’t think these kinds of issues are coming to Arizona, it’s time to wake up and have a whiff of Folgers….   On November 7, Michigan voters defeated Proposal 3, a referendum that would have allowed mourning dove hunting, by a margin of 68 percent to 32 percent. Anti-hunters financed the multi-million dollar campaign.   The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), the nation’s most powerful anti-hunting group, bankrolled the effort to ban the hunt with $1.6 million in contributions out of $2.3 million spent by the opponents’ campaign. Its contributions reveal a 250 percent increase over its previous record amount spent on a wildlife issue.   The HSUS and its puppet organization, the Committee to Restore the Dove Shooting Ban, purchased television airtime and ran anti-hunting messages throughout the final six weeks of the campaign.   This level of spending on a ballot issue is unprecedented for HSUS, and confirms sportsmen’s greatest fears about the retooled animal rights organization, which merged with the Fund for Animals in 2005. The merger put anti-hunting zealots in charge of more than $100 million that could be spent to take away hunting rights.   The sportsmen-led Citizens for Wildlife Conservation Committee, formed to defend the dove hunt, never truly got off the ground in its efforts to match the financial largesse of the anti-hunting campaign. The group raised less than $500,000, and was able to muster only a week-long radio campaign to combat the antis’ television ads.   The U.S. Sportsmen’s Alliance was one of the largest contributors to the campaign to protect the hunt, which had been established by the legislature in 2004.

PETA   Nov 25, 7:18 AM EST   PETA Mistakenly Targets Alaska Church   Advertisement  News Video   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The pastor at Anchorage First Free Methodist Church was mystified. Why was the activist group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals chastising him? No animals are harmed in the church’s holiday nativity display. In fact, animals aren’t used at all.   People, however, do dress the parts - Mary, Joseph, the wise men, etc. The volunteers stand shivering at a manger on the church lawn in a silent tribute to Christmas.   The Rev. Jason Armstrong was confused by an e-mail this week from PETA, which admonished him for subjecting animals “to cruel treatment and danger,” by forcing them into roles in the church’s annual manger scene.   “We’ve never had live animals, so I just figured this was some spam thing,” Armstrong said. “It’s rough enough on us people standing out there in the cold. So we’re definitely not using animals.”   Jackie Vergerio, PETA’s captive animals in entertainment specialist, said her organization tracks churches nationwide that use real animals in “living nativity scenes.”   Seems the confusion started with the church’s choice of phrase. PETA flagged Free Methodist’s display as a “living nativity,” and indeed, that’s how the church describes it on its Web site.   To PETA, that means animals.   “Those animals are subject to all sorts of terrible fates in some cases,” Vergerio said. “Animals have been stolen and slaughtered, they’ve been raped, they’ve escaped from the nativity scenes and have been struck by cars and killed. Just really unfathomable things have happened to them.”   Buy AP Photo Reprints   In the letter to Armstrong, Vergerio shared some sad fates of previous nativity animals - like Brighty the donkey, snatched from a nativity scene in Virginia and beaten by three young men. Ernie the camel fled a creche in Maryland but was struck and killed by a car. Two sheep and a donkey had to be euthanized after a dog mauling at a manger scene in Virginia.   Free Methodist’s display is peaceful, Armstrong said. The congregation erects the stable. Members spread straw and don costumes. Some even dress as manger animals.   “We have some puppet camel things we put out,” Armstrong said. “We have a cow hood thing that a person will wear that actually just looks spooky.”   The volunteers stand beneath a brightly lit electric star as Christmas music fills the frosty air. They don’t even speak.   “No one’s come by protesting or thrown bloodstained fur at us or anything,” Armstrong said. “We even use a plastic baby.”                                 Posted on 25th November 2006      Under:  General  |    1 Comment »                 Bobcat vs Deer                                  Wow - cool trailcam sequence   Bobcat                                 Posted on 24th November 2006      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 The Longest Minute                                  Wow - a GREAT story posted by a gent over on Monster Muleys   Story                                 Posted on 24th November 2006      Under:  Hunting  |    No Comments »                 Happy Thanksgiving                                  Thanksgiving                                 Posted on 23rd November 2006      Under:  General  |    No Comments »                 Now this is beyond weird                                  Ummm Okayyyy…   Man accused of having sex with dead deer   Duluth News Tribune  Nov. 15, 2006 03:13 PM   DULUTH, Minn. - Prosecution of a case involving alleged sexual contact with a dead deer may hinge on the legal definition of the word “animal.”   Bryan James Hathaway, 20, of Superior, Wis., faces a misdemeanor charge of sexual gratification with an animal. He is accused of having sex with a dead deer he saw beside a road on Oct. 11.   A motion filed last week by his attorney, public defender Fredric Anderson, argued that since the deer was dead, it was not considered an animal and the charge should be dismissed.  advertisement     “The statute does not prohibit one from having sex with a carcass,” Anderson wrote.   Judge Michael Lucci heard the motion Tuesday.   “I’m a little surprised this issue hasn’t been tackled before in another case,” Lucci said.   The Webster’s dictionary defines “animal” as “any of a kingdom of living beings,” Anderson said.   If you include carcasses in that definition, he said, “you really go down a slippery slope with absurd results.”   Anderson argued: When does a turkey cease to be an animal? When it is dead?   When it is wrapped in plastic packaging in the freezer? When it is served, fully cooked?   A judge should decide what the Legislature intended “animal” to mean in the statute, he said. “And the only clear point to draw the line in that definition, I believe, is the point of death.”   Assistant District Attorney James Boughner said the court can use a dictionary to determine the meaning of the word, but it doesn’t have to.   “The common and ordinary meaning of a word can be found in how people actually use the word,” Boughner wrote in his response to the motion.   When a person’s pet dog dies, he told Lucci, the person still refers to the dog as his or her dog, not a carcass.   “It stays a dog for some time,” Boughner said.   He referred to the criminal complaint, in which Hathaway told police he saw the dead deer in the ditch and moved it into the woods. Hathaway called it a dead deer, Boughner said, not a carcass.   “It did not lose its essence as a deer, an animal, when it died,” he said.   Anderson argued that the statute, which falls under the heading “crimes against sexual morality,” was meant to protect animals. That would be unnecessary in the case of a dead animal.   “If you look at the other crimes that are in this subsection, they all protect against something other than simply things we don’t like or things we find disgusting,” he said.   Other crimes in that subsection include incest, bigamy, public fornication and lewd and lascivious behavior.   Boughner said the focus of the statute was on punishing the human behavior, not protecting animals.   “It does not seem to draw a line between the living and the dead,” he said.   Interpreting the statute to exclude dead animals would also exclude freshly killed animals, Boughner said. That, he said, could lead to people who commit such acts with animals to kill them.   Lucci said he would render a decision by Hathaway’s next court appearance on Dec. 1.   The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of nine months in jail and a fine of up to $10,000. If convicted, Hathaway could serve a prison term of up to two years because of a previous conviction. In April 2005, Hathaway pleaded no contest to one felony charge of mistreatment of an animal for the shooting death of Bambrick, a 26-year-old horse, to have sex with the animal.

Put in for the muzzleloader hunt in 6A. If you get drawn, Ill guarantee you a bull. Those were the words from my friend that began the adventure. I had stopped in to ask my friend Greg McBride what hunts and units I should put in for, in Arizonas fall Big Game draw. Being a fine taxidermist, and an experienced hunter, Greg is a good friend to have. He is also my Number One source for advice, and for the past 2 years, his consultations had become a must. This was my 8th year living in Arizona, but only the 3rd year putting in for the Big Game Draw. So far, I had only been drawn for javelina; I still hadnt filled a tag of any kind. I was hoping that 2005 would be my year!   Twenty years ago, I was prowling around the softwood forests, cedar swamps, and hardwood ridges of New Brunswick, Canada where I was born and raised. I fished, hunted, and ran traplines. My worldly travels had taken me as far as northern Maine, a half hour away. I lived in Maine for about five years, before moving to Arizona. Never in my wildest dreams had I imagined Id be someday hunting elk in far off Arizona. You might as well have told me that Id be stalking keeflongs on the surface of the moon.   One never knows where life will take them however, and Arizona is indeed, where I ended up. Although I had arrived in Arizona in the spring of 1997, I had a delayed start, when it came to experiencing the outdoors. With a new job, a new wife, and ultimately  a new baby  I had really gotten sidetracked. Finally, in 2002, I started getting my feet wet again, so to speak. Not having any hunters at my job, I began to learn the strategies of Arizona hunting on my own. I found some websites, made outdoor friends when I could, and even signed on for a hitch as Assistant Editor of the Arizona Outdoorsman magazine. I had written outdoor columns back east, and had offered my services to the fledgling Arizona publication. I had started dabbling at being a Booking Agent as well  ironically, representing New Brunswick Outfitters at the Outdoor Shows here in the southwest. Ultimately, that is how I met Greg. I was in need of some mounts for my trade show booth, and Greg kindly offered to lend me some of his.   My home is located just east of Phoenix, and due to some logistical issues, I am limited to day trips. Greg knows my situation well, and always provided recommendations for the draw based on Unit distance, draw odds, success rates, etc. As I said, this was my third year entering the big game draw; so far, all I had drawn was javelina tags. I wasnt totally discouraged, as elk tags were getting harder and harder to draw, in Arizona. I was a 2-year veteran in seeing Not Drawn on my applications for antelope, antlered (rifle) deer, bear, elk and turkey. Finally, my 2005 applications were filled out, double- and triple-checked, funds inserted, and mailed in - about a week and a half before the deadline. Then the waiting began. I dont know how it works in other states, but in Arizona, the fall draw (and spring draw, to a lesser extent) is an interesting phenomenon. Its all hunters talk about, from the deadline, to when the results are announced. It is an obsession, really. The websites are buzzing. Hunters are antsy. Arizona Game & Fish adds to the agony by saying the drawing will occur no later than&. No firm date. No mark on the calendar indicating for sure when hunters can either jump for joy, or resign themselves to another year passing them by. When the no later than time period draws near, folks activity reaches the point where it almost frantic. The AZG&F website gets pounded as people check the draw results every 5 minutes. The phone lines get a work out as well, due to the sheer volume of people calling in to see if the results are available. It is indeed, a frenzy.   As the draw deadline drew near, my anticipation began to build, right along with everybody elses. On a particularly slow day at work, I logged on to see if the results were up. For a day or two, there had been a message on the site saying something to the effect that The draw results were being loaded, and would be available soon. When the screen came up, the same old message was still there. About 10 minutes later, I got away from what I was doing, went back to the site, and hit refresh after typing in my ID numbers the screen wobbled, and then it appeared:    Turkey     Not Drawn    Bear     Not Drawn    Elk, Bull    6A Permit #xxxx (ML only)    Mule Deer, Any antlered  24B Permit #xxxx   I blinked at first, kind of like a kid looking at a pile of gifts left by Santa or the Easter Bunny. For a few moments, it just didnt sink in. Gradually, it dawned on me  I had drawn an elk tag, and a deer tag! My first call was to my wife Karole. Now, Karole has always been supportive of my hunting related activities, but admittedly, she doesnt quite get it. She was happy for me, but her reaction was certainly less than animated. I had to call Greg! I called and dang it  he wasnt in. Excitedly, I left a message. Over the weeks and months to follow, he and I would be seeing a lot of each other, as we made plans. Greg asked if he could include a good friend of his, Bruce. Bruce was intimately familiar with my Unit, and was scouting it on a regular basis.   The next several weeks passed quickly in some ways, and agonizingly slow in other ways. Greg regaled me with Bruces reports, every time I stopped in to the taxidermy shop. Excitement was building, for sure. Sleepless nights became the norm. Bruce and Greg were constantly adjusting the plan, and the guarantee of a bull was so far, unscathed. Gregs only caveat was  Ill get you a shot, the shooting is up to you. Shooting was the least of my worries  I had never experienced a problem with my shooting ability. Never had succumbed to buck fever. My worries were on the logistics of the trip  not with making the shot.   As it turns out, Greg and Bruce drew tags for New Mexico. Their hunt started the day after we had planned our elk hunt. The finalized plan was that Greg and I would leave at 2:30 AM, drive north to meet Bruce at daylight, (hopefully) kill an elk, and head back. As I would stop at home, Greg and Bruce would drive all night to New Mexico (silly hunters!). Finally the day arrived, and true to my lifes experiences so far, Murphy was along for the ride. The weekend before, I was doing some final sighting in, with my muzzleloader. That night, while struggling with a stubborn breech plug, I turned the scope in the rings. Wednesday after work, I stopped at the range, and 3 shots confirmed my fears  they were not even on the paper any more. Luckily, I had a Plan B  Greg had been suggesting all along that I use his rifle. A nicer model than mine, and it was dead-on at 200 yards  it looked like I would be using his after all.   Friday morning, I picked Greg up at 2:15 AM. I loaded my gear into his truck, and away we went. The trip to 6A was quick, and uneventful  by 5:30, we had pulled up alongside of Bruces truck. We got out, Greg made the introductions, and we loaded up. Bruce briefed us, we had a game plan, and we ambled across the road, down into the forest. Crisp morning air and the smell of pines was something I hadnt experienced in years. I was nervous, excited, and anxious to see an elk!   We had strolled for less than half an hour when a strong odor wafted across my face. We all looked at each other, and Greg muttered Elk!& I had no idea those creatures would smell so strong. Less than 5 minutes later, Bruce spotted some elk trotting through the trees ahead. We ascertained where they were heading, and trotted ahead, intent on cutting them off. Finally, there they were  about 8 or 10 elk, about 120 yards away. I shed my pack, and Greg and I sprinted up to a suitable firing position. Greg pointed and hissed There  a good bull! Shoot!. I had braced my rifle on a branch. In my scope I saw a bull indeed  but he was quartered away, with 2 cows directly behind him. I waited to see if they would move. Greg was clearly excited  Shoot! I replied that I couldnt. Yes, you can! Shoot. I answered again, that I couldnt. Greg was clearly agitated, as the elk wandered out of sight. That was probably your one shot for the day, he said. After some discussion, we determined that we were looking at 2 different sets of elk. We had barely figured that out, when Bruce was motioning for us that he had spotted more elk. Again, Greg and I were quickly tromping up to a firing point. Frankly, I had been exercising working up to the hunt, but I was not ready for all of this running. An hour into the hunt, and I was getting pooped already. My eyes were taking it in, but my brain was having a hard time processing it. 180 yards across the little pasture in front of me, 50-60 elk were streaming from right to left. It looked like the Serengeti, on a National Geographic special. I found a rest, and picked a bull. He trotted into the opening, but as he stopped, 2 cows pulled up next to him. They then moved ahead, and he was in the clear. I picked a point-of-aim, and squeezed the trigger. BOOM, followed by the cloud of pungent smoke. The elk kept trotting along. Greg and I quickly reloaded as the bull moved over the draw, with the rest of the herd. There was no chance for a second shot. The elk had filed past Bruce, and he hadnt noticed any bulls acting as if they were hit. Greg and I checked the spot where the bull had stood. No hair, no blood. Just tracks and tracks and tracks. I was in disbelief, and was disappointed.   Soon we were chasing another herd through the trees. We got ahead of them, and planned an ambush. Greg pointed to an opening about 120 yards away. They will be going by there he said, get ready. My sight picture was focused on a 3 or 4 foot opening in the trees ahead. As I focused, Greg called it out Cow, cow, calf, calf, calf, cow, spike, cow, cow&bull.. there he is&get ready! As the bull stepped across the opening, I sighted and squeezed  KABOOM  with a belch of fire and smoke. Again, no bull fell. We inspected the spot, and again  found absolutely no sign of a hit. As the day progressed, we put a lot of miles on, and saw a lot of elk. I had packed my pack too full, and was in misery. After bull Number 2, I had relaxed my previous Ill shoot any bull except a spike rule. I was growing concerned, and discouraged. By noon, Bruce had to leave. We had been rained on, snowed on, and hailed on. As the end of the day drew near, we trudged back towards the truck. My mind was racing, I was sore and exhausted, and I was sad beyond words. Worst of all -I had taken shots at 5 different bulls! If we had seen one elk, we had seen 200. Greg stated that it was the most elk he had ever seen in a day of hunting. I was in shock. My dream hunt had turned into a disaster, and I felt guilty for wasting Greg and Bruces time. When I arrived home that night, I was near tears. My socks were a bloody mess. I was exhausted  by my calculations we had walked about 12 miles total that day. I had decided that I would never hunt again. I was disappointed beyond all belief. I had nary a clue of what happened. Over the next few weeks, the self-pity began to recede. I wrote a mini-account on some hunting websites that I participated on. Friends were supportive, and encouraged me to write the full story. It took courage they said, to relate my experiences so that others may learn. We always hear the success stories said one, but never the other stories. Mistakes are the best teachers. Thats why they call it hunting, said another. Weve all had trips like that  most of us never mention them.   Pulling up my boot straps, I analyzed the trip. I decided to make this a giant learning experience, instead of something terrible. Maybe other new elk hunters could learn as well. After a great deal of thought, I came up with the following root causes:   1. Weapon - I shouldn’t have “settled” on the other rifle, especially without shooting it. That is just stupid. I deferred to the experience of my friends, however. Also, as noted - time was a factor, and even finances (ammo) came into play. Regardless, I should have scheduled things in such a way that I had the time to get mine sighted back in, or at least - done some familiarization shooting with my friends rifle.   2. Confidence - Well, in this case, over-confidence. I was so confident that my buddies would get me into elk, that I was overly affected by the whole thing, when it turned sour. From the first missed shot, to the trip in its entirety; over confidence had added fuel to the humiliation and embarrassment. I had bought a freezer, and being a freelance writer - was already thinking of titles for an article. Confidence good; cockiness stupid.   3. Pressure (self)  Arizona hunting hadnt been kind to me. I put a lot of pressure on myself, and 3 seasons without a javelina led to me being even more determined to fill my elk tag. The quest for articles and photographs; not wanting to “let down” my friends and family, you name it. Instead of just relaxing and having fun, I put far too much pressure on myself.    4. Pressure (time) - Having only one day to hunt only added to the pressure. Add to that, my 2 buddies were driving to New Mexico, that night, for a deer hunt. There was a feeling that we needed to get this done, which resulted in rushed shots, or shots I wouldn’t normally take. More available days in the field would have definitely made a difference.   5. Attitude - I have always hunted by myself. Re-playing all of those shots in my head, many of them I would not have taken - either farther than what I was comfortable with, or at walking animals. My buddies were just trying to get me an elk; I think though, that being by myself, I would have chosen shots more carefully, not felt rushed, and probably - been more successful.    6. Fitness - I had been working out (particularly for the mule deer hunt) for about 6 weeks. It was mostly back and leg strength stuff, with some cardio. I was not prepared to run (in order to get ahead of herds). Next time, more cardio.   7. Equipment - I was evaluating a pack on behalf of a national Hunting Magazine (see #3 - pressure ). Thinking I only had a mile or two to go, I had packed it wayyy too heavy. I wore the wrong boots. At some point, my discomfort that day surely added to my lack of marksmanship, and certainly my frame of mind.    In summary, I know “that’s why they call it hunting”, but the experience certainly threw me for a loop. In spite of all the influencing factors I listed above, I still don’t know what REALLY happened that day. I used to teach marksmanship in the military. Like I said, no sniper - but I never would have imagined that not only would I miss once, but FIVE times. I am relieved that they were all clean misses (no animal reaction, no blood, no hair). We did check each time, and had I knowingly wounded an animal, my hunt would have been over. Looking back, it was a great trip. I had seen more elk in a day than some people see in several seasons. I learned a ton about their habits. The air was fresh and crisp, and I enjoyed (sort of) a great day with an old friend and a new one. I learned a new area well. Best of all, I think I hit almost every what not to do possible. I cant wait to draw another tag!
