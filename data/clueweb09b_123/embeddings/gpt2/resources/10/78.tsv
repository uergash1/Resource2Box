GX085-57-10364426	Consistent means to share geographic data among all          users could produce significant savings for data collection and use and          enhance decision making.  Executive          Order 12906  calls for the establishment of the National Spatial Data          Infrastructure defined as the technologies, policies, and people necessary          to promote sharing of geospatial data throughout all levels of government,          the private and non-profit sectors, and the academic community.          The goal of this Infrastructure is to reduce duplication          of effort among agencies, improve quality and reduce costs related to          geographic information, to make geographic data more accessible to the          public, to increase the benefits of using available data, and to establish          key partnerships with states, counties, cities, tribal nations, academia          and the private sector to increase data availability.          The NSDI has come to be seen as the technology, policies,          criteria, standards and people necessary to promote geospatial data sharing          throughout all levels of government, the private and non-profit sectors,          and academia. It provides a base or structure of practices and relationships          among data producers and users that facilitates data sharing and use.          It is a set of actions and new ways of accessing, sharing and using geographic          data that enables far more comprehensive analysis of data to help decision-makers          chose the best course(s) of action. Much has been accomplished in recent          years to further the implementation of the NSDI, but there is still much          to be done to achieve the vision of current and accurate geographic data          being readily available across the country.                  A Strategy for the NSDI  Published          April 1997         This strategy updates the 1994 Strategic Plan for the          NSDI. It was developed with broad input from stakeholders in the geospatial          data community, both within and outside of the federal government.

GX000-03-14293501	GIS applications of many different disciplines have          a recurring need for a few themes of data. The framework is a collaborative          community based effort in which these commonly needed data themes are          developed, maintained, and integrated by public and private organizations          within a geographic area. Local, regional, state and federal government          organizations and private companies see the framework as a way to share          resources, improve communications, and increase efficiency.
