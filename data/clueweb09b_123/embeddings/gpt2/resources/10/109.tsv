Cell phone providers such as Cingular are offering and developing more specialized services, features and possibilities all the time. Cingular advances the development of the industry by consistently being in the mind set to work to provide the latest in equipment so that cell phone users can accomplish more with their phone than they ever could. With the excellent versatility of today's cell phone, it can be much more than just a phone.  A  Cingular cell phone  can additionally be a gaming system, a music player, a television and even a digital camera.                            There are typically more than one cell phone user per U.S. household, and a steadily growing collection of families are using their cell phone as their only phone. Especially if you are thinking about making your Cingular cell phone your only phone, or in the event you are strictly looking for a new one, there are issues to look into so you can make an informed cell phone purchase.      Features and Benefits:  Remaining mindful of more practical features can be just as or more necessary than looking at the fun things like cameras, games, and music players. understand the more functional aspects of a particular cell phone too, including volume controls, an easily muted ringer,  and durability. If you would like a device with web and organizer capabilities, make certain that the system on the phone is easy to use and adjustable to your needs.       Phone Arrangement:  Whenever you can, visit a Cingular store and handle and hold the cell phone you are considering. Be certain that you can comfortably access the bulk of keypad with one hand. Make a test call if you can. Access the menu items on working demos and make sure that the way the cell phone is arranged is one you are happy with. The cell phone's size can affect the size of the keys, and if you have big hands, they could be difficult to use comfortably.       Display   Even though color screen displays are easily seen in dim light, or even no light at all, they frequently poorly perform in direct daylight. Ask the representative in the store if you can use the phone outdoors or under bright light.   Look at signal strength and battery indicators to make certain they are clearly visible. If knowing who is calling is significant to you, find out the way each phone you are looking at makes that known. If you are interested in a flip phone, consider whether or not an exterior incoming call display is a feature you need.     Price:  Depending on the Cingular phone plan you decide on, and the possibilities that you're looking into, there are phones available for very little, hundreds of dollars, or even free. Be sure to determine exactly what price range you can afford.      No matter  which  cell phone model you decide on, you should be happy with the features it has and the way it looks. With the progression of today's cell phone technology, you are sure to find one that best suits you and your busy life.
