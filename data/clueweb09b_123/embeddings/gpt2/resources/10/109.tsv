GX000-08-7323929	"Comet Images      Due to the ever increasing number of images, the image page has  been reorganized.  Each comet now has its own sub-page.   If you plan to republish any of the images presented on the COHP (on the Web,  USENET, or in print), you are strongly advised to obtain permission from the  person who took the image.  My understanding of copyright laws is that all  material is effectively copyrighted and the lack of a ""copyright"" does not  void that protection.  For explicitly copyrighted images, there is no grey area.   You must obtain permission from the person who took the image.        Information on submitting images is provided    here.  (Updated 2/26/96)       Images are available for the following comets...  Dates indicate when the sub-page was last updated.
