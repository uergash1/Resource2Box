Occurring                         in nearly all countries, this phenomenon constitutes the major corpus of evidence we possess of humanity’s cultural, cognitive,                         semiotic and artistic beginnings; it is the principal component of surviving pre-historic cultural heritage. Its study is                         today an interdisciplinary, multi-facetted scientific pursuit, which replaces traditional archaeological approaches that focused                         on perceived styles and meanings.                                                                                                                                             Much of this global palaeoart patrimony is under threat, not only from natural agencies, but also and most especially through                         destruction by human agency. The latter can include the conduct of researchers, the effects of site tourism, industrial and                         other development, and polluting emissions that generate atmospheric acidification. Many methods have been developed to study                         aspects of rock art conservation, to learn how and when rock art was created, and to record the images on rock surfaces. In                         all of this work, there is a distinctive trend to preferring non-intrusive methods of study, which involve no physical contact                         with the rock and no removal of samples for analysis. Those applied to petroglyphs (markings made by removing material from                         rock surface) and pictograms (made by adding material to a rock surface) tend to differ, especially in analytical and preservation                         work. For instance, attempts to determine the age of the latter type, which occurs in the forms of rock paintings, drawings,                         prints and stencils, usually focus on the age of the applied substance (or some inclusion found in it), which in the case                         of petroglyphs is not recoverable.                                                                                                                                             Scientific work in this field includes the study of the tools and materials used in rock art production, and the determination                         of paint compositions and microscopic inclusions or other features illuminating processes and behaviour. Often the methods                         used in this resemble those of forensic science. Other work so far conducted has addressed the chemical sourcing of pigment                         materials, and the microscopic excavation of strata of paint residues, mineral accretions, weathering phenomena and patination                         zones. Of importance is also the secure discrimination between natural and humanly made rock markings, to ensure that neither                         is mistaken for the other.                                                                                                                       The iconographic interpretation of rock art, which in the past has dominated the concerns of this field of research, can only                         be regarded as being scientifically based when sound ethnographic information is available. This may be oral, deriving from                         the artists or knowledgeable informants of the same culture, or alternatively it may derive from decipherable inscriptions                         accompanying rock art imagery, in specific world regions. Such access, however, does not exist in most circumstances, and                         other iconographic interpretations are merely freestanding constructs of autosuggestion, reflecting the interpreting intellect                         and perception; they are not testable.                                                                                                                                            Alternative forms of interpretation are more promising, e.g. through the use of analytical tools provided by the cognitive                         sciences and semiotics. Human knowledge derives from concept-building cognitive processes responding to external stimuli,                         thereby accumulating percepts. The introduction of consciously created sensory information stored outside the human brain                         in the form of symbols rendered perceived reality conceptually manageable. Conscious experience became possible because at                         some point in human evolution the neural facilities prompted by the production of early symbols became available for the processing                         of reality’s stochastic stimuli in visual and mental taxonomizing formats. Thus the very early rock art forms the major remaining                         precipitate of our cognitive evolution and is a potential source of information in the quest to understand it. In this, the                         non-figurative component of rock art may be more instructive than the figurative, which in orthodox archaeological approaches                         has been treated as the principal source of information.                                                                                                                                                           Long Entry                                                                       “Rock art” defines somewhat arbitrarily non-utilitarian, humanly made markings on natural rock surfaces, made either by an                         additive (the application of material) or a reductive process (the removal of rock material). The former results in a pictogram                         or rock painting (including pigment drawing, stencil and beeswax figure); the latter is a petroglyph or engraving, sometimes                         called carving. The term rock art is usually not applied to human markings on prepared or dressed stone surfaces, such as                         may be found on buildings or rock-hewn structures (e.g. temples or pyramids). Nor does it include humanly made but unintentional                         rock markings (e.g. occasioned by bulldozers), utilitarian rock markings (e.g. axe grinding grooves) or marks made by non-human                         animal species, even if made “deliberately” (e.g. certain forms of cave bear claw marks in many European caves). Thus the                         term “rock art” is quite arbitrary, intended to refer to rock markings of semiotic content.                                                                                                                   Rock art occurs in nearly all countries. Its uneven distribution is not so much attributable to differences in cultural conventions,                         it is primarily a taphonomic attribute (i.e. a result of preservation bias). In particular, the high-pH and low precipitation                         regimes of arid regions have greatly facilitated its preservation in such areas as the Sahara, Arabia, central Asia, the American                         Southwest, Peru and Australia. Another major determinant of rock art distribution is geology. Some of the largest surviving                         concentrations are those found in the sandstone facies of the former Gondwana plate, which have facilitated the formation                         of rock shelters that provide excellent preservation conditions. Similarly, the practice of Upper Paleolithic rock artists                         to place some of their productions in deep limestone caves has significantly helped the survival of some of that period’s                         rock art. By comparison, the survival of Pleistocene rock art at open sites is limited to very weathering-resistant rock types                         and primarily to arid regions.                                                                                                                   Pre-historic rock art represents by far the largest body of evidence we possess of humanity’s cultural, cognitive and artistic                         beginnings. Through its relative permanence, it has profoundly influenced the beliefs and cultural conventions of subsequent                         societies up to the present. It is therefore an integral part of humanity’s collective memory, and the greatest surviving                         witness of our cultural, cognitive and semiotic evolution.                                                                                                                   Historical and geographical overview                                                                                          Until recent decades, reliable information about global rock art remained severely restricted. For instance, no publication                         about Chinese rock art had appeared in English until 1984, yet the earliest literary mentions of rock art are from China.                         The philosopher Han Fei (280–233 B.C.) provided the first known reference to rock art, while the geographer Li Daoyuan (A.D.                         386–434) described numerous rock art sites in China and even mentioned occurrences in India. In South America, Captain De                         Carvalho first reported rock art in 1598 in what is now Brazil, and published his recordings in 1618. The first known recordings                         in Europe, made by Peder Alfssön in Denmark in 1627, were not published until 1784. More determined scholarly efforts commenced                         during the 19th century, focusing initially on Russia, Scandinavia and northern Africa, later on southern Africa, parts of                         South America, North America, Australia and eventually India.                                                                                                                   With the beginning of the 20th century, after orthodox archaeology finally accepted the authenticity of Franco-Cantabrian                         cave art (which it had rejected for decades), the study of rock art became nominally integrated into mainstream archaeology.                         This promoted the proliferation of stylistic constructs and the development of ultimately unproductive methods. For instance,                         some archaeologists considered that taxonomic constructs and statistical analyses of stylistic or morphological matrices of                         motif types would provide empirical interpretations, in the same way other artifacts were classified and interpreted statistically.                         However, rock art has no archaeologically perceptible time depth, and most major rock art sites are cumulative assemblages                         deriving from different eras. Lumping these different traditions together and treating them as a “style” because they occur                         at the same place serves no useful purpose, and this is even before the complex issues of selective survival (taphonomy) are                         considered. Thus the greatest barrier to integrating rock art successfully into archaeology was the intractability of its                         dating. Worldwide, there have been only about twenty instances of reasonably convincing minimum dating by finding rock art                         under supposedly datable sediments.                                                                                                                   The last few decades of the 20th century witnessed the emergence of rock art research organizations in many parts of the world,                         beginning in North America, Australia and Western Europe. In 1988 these bodies formed the International Federation of Rock                         Art Organizations (IFRAO), which currently has over forty affiliated member associations, covering in effect most of the world.                         One of their principal aims is to introduce scientific methods, grounded in such diverse disciplines as geology, semiotics                         or cognitive science. This trend is currently replacing interpretative endeavors with contextual studies, and concerns with                         meaning are giving way to epistemological rigor.                                                                                                                   The pre-eminence of the Franco-Cantabrian cave art has in some respects overshadowed the appreciation of the many other, often                         much greater rock art traditions, in Europe as well as elsewhere. For instance, the extensive concentrations of petroglyphs                         in Fontainebleau (France), Galicia, western and southern Alps or across Scandinavia receive much less attention, because they                         are of the Holocene rather than the Late Pleistocene. On the other hand, the Ice Age petroglyph traditions of Australia, which                         may well be a hundred times greater than the corpus of European cave art of the same age, also have attracted limited interest.                         Asia, too, comprises several bodies of rock art that surpass numerically any European regional corpus, and some of it is much                         older than the oldest rock art of Europe. Most of the countries of the Middle East are rich in rock art, especially Saudi                         Arabia, Iran and Israel. Across central Asia, including the Tibetan Plateau, there are numerous reports of rock art, but little                         detailed survey work has been conducted. The rock art of Siberia and China is much better explored, with well over 10,000                         sites known in the latter region. India boasts not only one of the largest concentrations of rock art in the world, the currently                         earliest known tradition is also found there. The countries of South-East Asia all feature rock art, as do most islands in                         the Pacific. The world’s largest concentration, however, appears to be that of Australia, thought to be in excess of 100,000                         sites. That continent’s body probably includes the largest Ice Age component, estimated to be up to 20% of the entire corpus.                                                                                                                   Africa, too, boasts some large rock art concentrations, beginning with the several art regions of the Sahara. In terms of                         its artistic finery, Saharan art is matched by few traditions, one of them being the Bushmen/San rock paintings of southern                         Africa. Other painting and petroglyph traditions occur also in that region, and in most other parts of Africa. Finally, the                         Americas are also well endowed with rock art, with major concentration in the Southwest of the United States and neighboring                         areas of Mexico, and in the Andean regions of South America, from western Venezuela to Patagonia. Further bodies of rock art                         occur in much of Central America and in various parts of Brazil.                                                                                                                   Conservation and site management                                                                    Humanity lavishes billions of dollars annually on its art objects, art repositories and art industry. By comparison, its endeavors                         to look after its oldest and most valuable art treasures are miniscule. Despite its appearance of relative robustness, rock                         art is quite fragile, and what we see today is only the tiny surviving fraction of what was once created. Two factors need                         to be distinguished in the deterioration of rock art: the effects of natural processes, and the damage occasioned by human                         agency. The mitigation of the former is often difficult, whereas that of anthropic destruction is in most cases easily achievable.                         Deterioration by humanly introduced factors far outweighs natural degradation. The rock art that exists today does so because                         it has survived a great many natural decay processes, often surviving in a state of relative equilibrium with its ambient                         environment. It could persist much longer if there is no significant change in its preservation conditions, especially one                         introduced by human intervention. This may be as simple as the introduction of human visitation to a formerly pristine site,                         or as complex as the occurrence of acid rain caused by industrialization.                                                                                                                   The principal natural agent of rock art loss is moisture, mainly in the form of rainwater, capillary moisture in porous rock,                         condensation in caves and shelters, freeze-and-thaw cycles, surface run-off, and secondary effects such as salt efflorescence                         or exfoliation. Physical weathering of rock art panels occurs as insolation (solar radiation), lightning strikes, brushfires,                         tectonic adjustments and kinetic damage (aeolian, gravity or water induced). Many forms of biological factors can contribute                         to weathering, including bacteria, fungi, lichens, algae, mosses, larger plants, insects (mud-daubing wasps, termites, bees),                         nesting birds and various larger animals, especially domestic and feral species. For many of these threats, protective measures                         have been found. Site hydrology, for instance, can be controlled by artificial silicone driplines in shelters.                                                                                                                   One animal, however, is causing far greater rock art destruction than all other factors taken together. Of the many forms                         of damage occasioned by humans the perhaps most repulsive is that occasioned by researchers, be it through misguided recording                         activities or through their role in permitting or condoning the destruction of rock art by industrial or infrastructure development.                         The former has been largely eliminated in recent decades, but the latter continues unabated in much of the world. Tourists                         and site visitors contribute to rock art deterioration, though it has often been found necessary to sacrifice some sites to                         them in order to preserve many others. The locations of new sites are no longer made public, and well known pristine sites                         such as Chauvet, Cussac and Cosquer Caves in France are totally closed to all, except a few researchers who only enter these                         sites with careful precautions to prevent contamination. For instance, researchers are not allowed to walk on the floor of                         Chauvet Cave. In Australia, most of the country’s cave art sites are only accessible to two or three researchers.                                                                                                                   The tasks of professional rock art conservators include graffiti removal, moisture and climate monitoring and control, and                         the design of site management measures. The latter differ according to local circumstances, and include such measures as the                         erection of fences to keep out animals, the installation of visitor boardwalks and paths, and in some regions protective grilles.                         In modern site management practice, the concept of “site fabric” is paramount, referring to all physical and non-physical                         aspects of a place, including accretionary deposits on the rock, even its ambience or religious significance. The primary                         principle of intervention at a rock art site is that any modifications must be fully reversible. Today’s site conservation                         and management practices may well be superseded tomorrow, and the cultural resource in question is, after all, not renewable.                                                                                                                   The study of rock art                                                                    Since rock art has begun to be recorded, centuries ago, the purpose of such records has always been to create a visual register                         of those aspects of the art that were deemed important. This has remained so until quite recently, and it follows that rock                         art recordings are usually interpretations of individual observers, not objective data. Indeed, this principle is embodied                         in a ruling of the High Court of Austria in 2003, that rock art recordings are copyrighted because they are individual interpretations                         by the recorder. This is now changing with the introduction of sophisticated digital recording systems that yield much more                         objective results.                                                                                                                   Nevertheless, the ready availability of computer equipment and electronic image manipulating software does not necessarily                         obviate other recording techniques. It is certainly appropriate to discard all those that are invasive or threaten the research                         integrity of rock art. Many such methods have been used extensively in the past, but there is no longer any justification                         to continue with them. These physical enhancement methods have included the application of clear liquids to close the pores                         of silica skins or other thin accretions, thus improving photographic records. Another common practice has been the outlining                         of rock art with chalk and a variety of other markers, including dye, pencil, lipstick, and felt pen. Archaeologists have                         contaminated the geochemical fabric of thousands of square meters of petroglyphs by applying organic white and black paints,                         to facilitate manual recording. The use of pressure-sensitive films, rubbings made with a great variety of materials, the                         production of casts from latex, plaster of Paris, papier mâché, thermoplastic resin and so forth have all been found to affect                         the rock art, and in some cases have caused spectacular damage to it. The use of transparent film to copy fragile art can                         also be damaging, because these sheets tend to be electrostatic and the movement of pens or fingers can attract small flakes                         of material from paintings. Even the use of aluminium foil tamped gently into petroglyphs before it is backed by stiffer material,                         regarded as a reasonably safe method, has been opposed by a chemist working with rock art.                                                                                                                   There is one very simple rule now in recording: unless the rock art in question is about to be destroyed by other factors,                         no invasive method and no contact is acceptable. It would be selfish to prejudice future analytical methods rock art scientists                         of future centuries might bring to bear upon the rock art—methods we cannot begin to speculate about.                                                                                                                   There is no need to resort to damaging and superseded methodology. Photography, sometimes in combination with non-contact                         enhancement techniques, is now universally available. Raking light photography (oblique lighting at night) is far more effective                         in recording petroglyphs than manual recording, which is a cumbersome and subjective procedure. A variety of filters and special                         films are available to improve photographs of rock art. Cross-polarized photography, using two light sources with polarizing                         filters, can greatly enhance contrast. It is important that a calibrated color and gray scale be included on all rock art                         photographs, the most widely used being the IFRAO Standard Scale. This has a number of purposes, the foremost being the facility                         of color reconstitution. All photographic records are of distorted color, and all of them fade with time, therefore a color                         profile included on a photograph permits the digitized recovery of original color of the object at the time the image was                         taken.                                                                                                                   The use of photogrammetry, which has been sporadic in rock art survey work, has experienced a revival due to the introduction                         of digital elevation model (DEM) software. This can generate accurate three-dimensional recordings of petroglyphs. An alternative                         approach is the use of laser scanners to produce virtual digital models of great accuracy and versatility. Micro-topography                         of rock art has also been attempted with a CCD camera by obliquely projecting a grating fine grid over the rock art. The most                         time-consuming method of reproducing panels or sites is the production of physical rock art facsimiles. This has been sporadically                         used for many decades, but recent technological developments render the process much easier and more precise. Facsimiles are                         constructed by first acquiring the necessary topographic data, traditionally either by photogrammetry or the use of precision                         theodolites, but more recently by laser equipment. The rock panel is then recreated and the rock art projected onto it.                                                                                                                   Archaeological age estimations, generated by considerations of style and “content”, have varied greatly for specific corpora.                         In the great majority of cases, they have been refuted by recent scientific dating work, suggesting that age determination                         of rock art by stylistic or archaeological means is tenuous at best. During the 1980s, this led to the replacement by forms                         of “direct dating”, in which the age of dating criteria physically and directly related to the rock art is determined. Propositions                         of the chronological relationship of these criteria with the rock art must be testable, i.e. refutable. The dating criterion                         may be of the same age as the rock art (e.g. an organic binder contained in the paint residue of a pictogram, or the fracture                         surfaces caused by the impact that occurred when a petroglyph was made); or it may be older than the rock art (e.g. its support                         surface, or a lichen thallus dissected by an engraved line); or it may be younger than the rock art (e.g. a superimposed insect                         nest, or a mineral accretion concealing the art). There are numerous types of such directly relatable criteria, most of which                         have been provided by geochemistry so far. However, direct dating offers no actual ages of rock art; it merely generates testable                         propositions about the relevance of specific physical or chemical data to the true age of rock art. The interpretation of                         this relationship demands an understanding of the method used, of the circumstances of sample collection, and of the limitations                         applying to stated results. The principal difficulty experienced with this approach is that the interpretation of its results                         is usually contingent on such complex qualifications that they are difficult to relate to immediate concerns of archaeology.                                                                                                                   The first method used in this quest was radiocarbon analysis of mineral accretions containing atmospheric carbon, such as                         carbonates and oxalates. These are often found in direct physical relation with rock art, but the utility of their results                         is limited by a complex set of qualifications. Uranium-series dating (thorium-uranium) has also been applied to carbonate.                         Most widely used has been the carbon-isotope analysis of inclusions in mineral accretions or in paint residues, and the determination                         of the age of charcoal pigments. Here, the qualifications are somewhat simpler. In the former method, the principal limitation                         is that, to obtain valid estimates, the nature of the analyzed substance must be determined, either at the object or molecular                         level. Until recently, all such determinations referred to bulk samples, but in 2005, an Italian team succeeded in isolating                         the dated substance molecularly in rock paintings at five Libyan sites.                                                                                                                   The determination of carbon ages of charcoal pictograms is a straightforward method, but unfortunately, the date refers to                         the time when the tree in question assimilated carbon from the atmosphere, not to the time of rock art production. Ancient                         charcoal might have been used in this, and often was, which introduces an obvious limitation to such results. The most reliable                         results from any pictograms so far are 137 carbon isotope determinations obtained from beeswax figures in northern Australia.                         An experimental approach is to use sand grains embedded in wasp or termite nests directly related to rock art to determine                         when they were last exposed to light, using the optically stimulated luminescence method.                                                                                                                   Petroglyphs may be more difficult to date than paintings, because they offer no substance relating to the time of their execution.                         Nevertheless, the surfaces then freshly exposed and the mineral crystals broken or truncated experience significant changes                         over time, which are utilized in microerosion analysis. A very robust analytical method, it yields reliable dates for petroglyph                         manufacture, but they are typically imprecise and several preconditions need to be met. Recently, digital colorimetry has                         been applied to both repatinated petroglyphs and pigment pictograms, after surprisingly consistent results were secured from                         historical inscriptions of known ages. Other approaches, so far not effectively applied, would be to use lichenometry or rock                         surface retreat for estimating the ages of petroglyphs, or the use of weathering zone growth rates and macro-wanes. There                         is thus considerable scope for extending the range of viable direct dating methods.                                                                                                                   Present indications of rock art ages suggest a significant increase of quantity during the early to mid-Holocene, perhaps                         7000 or 6000 years ago. Large corpora in arid regions begin simultaneously around that time, which is almost certainly a phenomenon                         of selective preservation rather than an indication of cultural practice. In temperate regions, large bodies of surviving                         rock art first appear by the Neolithic or Bronze Age, where local lithologies are suitable. More arid regions, weathering-resistant                         rock types and well-sheltered sites have sometimes preserved remnants of much older traditions. Therefore the temporal distribution                         of rock art is universally related to preservation issues, especially those of lithology and climate.                                                                                                                   While the scientific study of rock art may still be in its infancy, it is not limited to issues of antiquity. Investigations                         of the technology of rock art have involved several productive approaches, including the study of the tools used in making                         petroglyphs, of paint recipes, of microscopic inclusions found in paint residues, and of the sourcing of pigment materials.                         Nano-stratigraphy—the microscopic excavation of strata of paint residues, mineral accretions or weathering and patination                         zones—was first introduced in the 1970s, and has been developed to great sophistication already. Its principles are rather                         similar to those of archaeological stratigraphy, but its methods, obviously, are very different. To some extent, this method                         might even overcome the limitation of rock art being, in contrast to archaeological sediment strata, apparently two-dimensional.                                                                                                                   Various other issues have been explored by rock art science in recent decades, such as the establishment of criteria for the                         effective discrimination between humanly made rock marks and natural markings on rocks. This had previously been a major problem,                         resulting in hundreds of cases of misidentification of both types of rock markings. Most of these mistakes refer to petroglyphs                         and natural markings resembling them, but there are also a few prominent cases of pictogram misidentifications on record.                         One of the most promising areas of scientific investigation of rock art concerns the holistic analysis of its physical, cultural                         and cognitive contexts. This includes the examination, often by field microscopy, of traces related to the production of rock                         markings, especially in well-preserved condition (particularly in caves). The methods used closely resemble those of forensic                         science (matching of microscopic striae, identification of microscopic organic traces and so forth), and are designed to determine                         the gestures involved in making the rock art. Their results can be correlated with other evidence in the same context (e.g.                         subterranean mining of flint and possible medicinal use of speleothems, or probable indications of ritualistic behavior. Some                         examples of the latter are the intentional placing of cave bear bones or other objects, or the systematic marking of cave                         walls by deliberate activities not yielding rock art.).                                                                                                                   The interpretation of rock art                                                                                          Traditionally, the greatest preoccupation of rock art researchers has been to interpret the iconography of rock art, i.e.                         what it is thought to depict, its meaning and its cultural role in ancient societies. Stylistic sequences were based on this                         approach in most world regions, and were refined and honed by successive scholars. Its basis was the plethora of stylistic                         genres perceived by the leading researchers, often constructs of a tenuous nature.                                                                                                                   According to one of these models, the cave art of western Europe developed from the most simple to the most complex and ornate                         styles, from about 35,000 to 10,000 years ago. This fundamental tenet, and with it the stylistic chronology of Ice Age cave                         art, fell with the 1994 discovery of Chauvet Cave, and the subsequent dating of some of its ultra-sophisticated rock art to                         about 32,000 radiocarbon years (well over 35,000 sidereal years, due to the Campanian Ignimbrite event). This demonstrated                         the inexpedience of simplistic evolutionary schemes in the interpretation of Pleistocene art traditions.                                                                                                                   Moreover, there are significant limitations to our access to such intractable dimensions of rock art as its meaning. Most                         rock art motifs are not adequately detailed naturalistic depictions of objects to permit reliable identifications, and such                         pronouncements are almost never testable for pre-historic rock art. The only blind test ever conducted of the ability of an                         alien researcher to effectively identify meaning in rock art occurred in northern Australia in 1977. A professor of anatomy                         showed that he himself had misidentified 90% of a body of animal and human depictions at the site Beswick Cave, after he became                         aware that the artists were still alive. He also reported that to correctly associate and integrate individual motifs into                         a whole to express the purpose and thought context of the paintings was totally dependent upon direct cultural information.                         Such access is of course impossible to pre-historic cultures; therefore, it would be imprudent to rely on the “identifications”                         of scenes, figures or artistic intentions by contemporary scholars posing as experts. Our own perception does not define reality,                         and even less can it define the realities perceived in other cultures. Our interpretations are freestanding constructs involving                         autosuggestion, reflecting our interpreting intellect and perception. They are not necessarily false, but their veracity is                         untestable and on balance they need to be regarded as reflections of the way we interpret reality—which we need to assume                         differs from the reality construct, cognition, and visual or mental perception of the now mute rock artist.                                                                                                                   Valid ethnographic interpretation of rock art is very limited indeed, and is largely restricted to Australia, although a few                         isolated cases elsewhere are known. It has been given much less prominence than the fanciful interpretations of rock art by                         humanist scholars, which usually involve shamans, trance visions, space travelers, rituals, religion, head-hunting, cannibalism                         and a whole gamut of less entertaining variations. These interpretations provide insights into the perception, cognition,                         and cultural and academic conditioning of the interpreter. Because of the inadequate state of rock art dating we can in most                         cases not even know which period, culture and people the rock art in question is attributable to, yet often these tenuous                         interpretations are used as the basis of estimating rock art age.                                                                                                                   Other forms of rock art interpretation have been neglected but are more promising. For instance, semiotic analysis to examine                         the syntax of rock art seems viable, and the study of work traces and of contextualizing rock art within spatially related                         evidence of other activities is most promising in cave sites. This may include the reconstruction of the gestures involved                         in creating the rock art. Psychological interpretation, for example in terms of graphic universals, is likely to yield testable                         information. As in all areas of rock art research, there is much room for improvement, which is precisely what renders this                         discipline so exciting and promising.                                                                                                                   Rock art and semiotics                                                                                          Recently, a trend has become evident in rock art research to explore the cultural and cognitive development of humans through                         rock art, especially of the Pleistocene period. Cognitive evolution, informed by advances in neuroscience and psychology,                         is increasingly becoming relevant to the understanding of the earliest art. Pleistocene rock art and portable art-like productions                         can provide evidence that may help test particular models as to how human cognition may have developed. As research into cognition                         and neuroscience continues apace, rock art and other paleoart are becoming primary data sources in this quest. Underlying                         principles and universals need to be identified, and the available material of the Middle and Early Upper Pleistocene requires                         much more attention than has been evident in the 20th century. This reflects a change from traditional preoccupations to new                         approaches. It will endeavor to place Ice Age paleoart into the context of cognitive evolution, explore its semiotic dimensions,                         and consider implications for technology and culture during the Paleolithic period.                                                                                                                   In exploring our cognitive origins we need to appreciate that hominins did not become human through the natural processes                         that modified their skeletal architecture, but through processes enabling them to develop culture, cognition and technology                         on a scale removing humans far from all other primates in those areas. However, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have                         provided us with a history of the human ascent that focuses very much on the physical evolution of hominins. By comparison,                         almost no effort has been directed towards learning about their cognitive and cultural evolution. It is therefore quite right                         to say that the reasons for humanization and the processes involved have so far barely been considered, and most certainly                         they have not been clarified. Culture is scientifically defined as the passing on of practice by non-genetic means (i.e. by                         learning), and is therefore practiced not only by humans, but also by many other animals, especially primates. “Biological                         intelligence” does not necessarily lead to a better grasp of objective reality for the species concerned. While it is true                         that intelligent forms of life must participate in a process that inevitably leads to the evolution of more intelligent forms                         of life, the improvements will always be in terms of their ability to enhance access to energy and nutrient resources, and                         to promote procreational potential, never in terms of facilitating a better grasp of reality. Genotypes determine the sensory                         faculties of an organism, and changes only occur within the confines of phenotypic plasticity. These abilities determine which                         material stimuli an organism can detect. Genes can also form neural circuitry that allows cross-referencing of sensory information,                         but the ability to construct conceptual models of reality, which defines “intelligence” biologically, is not itself genetically                         determined. Among highly advanced life forms, selection will favor organisms capable of the conceptual and behavioral innovations                         from which new behavioral modes can be constructed: the mental faculties, not their constructs, are the selective determinant.                         Similarly, cortical or speech-related structures are results, not causes, of evolutionary selection favoring speech (applied                         symbolism) or intelligence: a selection criterion needs to be established before it can affect phenotypic selection of genes.                                                                                                                   The introduction of phenomena consisting only of humanly perceptible variables, such as the production of symbolic surface                         markings, rendered perceived “reality” conceptually manageable, by providing complete rather than fragmentary sets of percepts.                         Visual and mental taxonomizing processes and the inclusion of the new neural structures in cybernetic feedback systems thus                         became available for selection. “Conscious experience”, or rather what we understand by it, became possible because the neural                         facilities prompted by earliest paleoart production became available for the processing of stimuli of the non-artificial material                         world, in a taxonomizing format.                                                                                                                   Human knowledge is thus derived from applying concept-building cognitive processes to external stimuli, i.e. sensory information,                         thus accumulating percepts. It is self-evident that human knowledge has a tendency of reinforcing itself through its own products,                         because it is continually validated and augmented by our material and cultural achievements. Cultural dynamics refer to the                         processes by which the intelligent organism alters its perceptible environment through its dialectic participation in the                         processes shaping it. Selection in favor of increased levels of “intelligence” is the inevitable outcome of such interaction                         among percepts, concepts and behavior patterns, but at no stage of this autonomous process is there any need for the concepts                         to be in tune with objective reality. Provided that the internally consistent logical framework is not challenged by it, there                         is no reason to assume that an entirely false, cultural cosmology or epistemological model could not be formed and maintained                         indefinitely by an intelligent species. Evolutionary success is irrelevant to the objective merits or validity of such models.                         The concepts of reality that have evolved in the course of hominin and human history have led to the one apparently held by                         all extant human populations. There is no reason to assume that these concepts could be particularly useful in exploring objective                         reality.                                                                                                                   The simplistic view that the animal figures in Ice Age art are cognitively more sophisticated than the often highly complex                         “geometric patterns” found in Pleistocene arts is easily refuted. If we separate art works into three-dimensional figurative,                         two-dimensional figurative and non-figurative genres, we see that the first is the least complex and the last the most complex.                         This is because in the first art genre, referent (the object depicted, the signified) and referrer (the art motif) are cognitively                         relatable by direct visual resemblance of certain characteristics. In graphic figurative art, the referent is related to the                         art motif through the projection of certain of its characteristics onto a two-dimensional plane, so the perception of its                         relationship to the referrer involves a decoding process requiring certain cognitive faculties. In entirely non-figurative                         arts as well as those that use highly “stylized” versions of iconicity it is impossible to know the referrer, unless one has                         direct access to the cultural conventions in question. Moreover, in the last-named art form, concepts or ideas involving no                         figuratively definable referents can readily be “depicted”. It is therefore clearly the semiotically most sophisticated art                         genre, and can communicate unlimited numbers of ideas, in rather the same way as written characters.                                                                                                                   This separation can be correlated broadly with the main stages of symbolic evolution. The Makapansgat cobble, an object almost                         three million years old, seems to indicate an early hominin ability to detect at least some aspects of iconicity, even if                         only at a “reflexive” level. It would then be reasonable to consider that subsequent hominins developed the capacity to detect                         iconic properties of natural objects (such as the Tan-Tan and Berekhat Ram pebbles). A predilection for abstracting three-dimensional                         likeness to graphic image apparently developed more recently, perhaps preceded by an ability to replicate two-dimensional                         imagery, such as phosphenes, fossil imprints and, in some traditions, eventually tracks. The use of non-iconic markings to                         form complex patterns of communicable meaning seems to originate in Middle Paleolithic traditions of Africa or Asia, on present                         evidence. This last art form, the most sophisticated, dominates in most of Upper Paleolithic Eurasia. Even in the western                         European cave art, “non-figurative” motifs far outnumber zoomorphs, and since they are almost certainly symbols of specific                         meanings, they are more semiotically complex than the usually favored animal figures. An animal picture, by itself, communicates                         very little by comparison, but it has been much more likely to attract scholarly attention. By Upper Paleolithic times, traditions                         of using non-iconic markings had become so sophisticated that they appear to have served for mnemonic, record-keeping or other                         exceedingly complex semiotic activities, e.g. in Russia and Siberia. Their vestiges have so far attracted only cursory attention                         and these traditions remain profoundly unknown.                                                                                                                   The semiotic dimensions of early rock art and other paleoarts thus remain under-explored, yet they could offer valuable insights                         into how we as a species formed constructs of reality and created our world. It is of utmost importance to the human species                         to develop this aspect of semiotic studies.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Discuss this issue on the  talk page .  (November 2008)              Solar hot water panels for heating a swimming pool in the  Netherlands       Solar hot water  is water heated by the use of  solar energy .   Solar heating  systems are generally composed of solar  thermal  collectors, a  fluid  system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage. The system may use  electricity  for pumping the fluid, and have a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat water for a wide variety of uses, including home, business and industrial uses. Heating  swimming pools ,  underfloor heating  or energy input for  space heating  or  cooling  are more specific examples.   In many  climates , a solar heating system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. [ 1 ]  This can include domestic non-electric  concentrating solar thermal  systems. In many northern  European  countries, combined hot water and space heating systems ( solar combisystems ) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy.   In the southern regions of  Africa  like  Zimbabwe , solar water heaters have been gaining popularity, thanks to the  Austrian - [ 2 ]  and other  EU -funded projects that are promoting more environmentally friendly water heating solutions.   Residential solar thermal installations can be subdivided into two kinds of systems: compact and pumped systems. Both typically include an auxiliary energy source (electric heating element or connection to a gas or fuel oil central heating system) that is activated when the water in the tank falls below a minimum temperature setting such as 50  C . Hence, hot water is always available. The combination of solar hot water heating and using the back-up heat from a wood stove chimney to heat water [ 3 ]  can enable a hot water system to work all year round in cooler climates without the supplemental heat requirement of a solar hot water system being met with fossil fuels or electricity.   Among pumped options, there is an important distinction to be made regarding the sustainability of the design of the system. This relates to what source of energy powers the pump and its controls. The type of pumped solar thermal systems which use mains electricity to pump the fluid through the panels are called low carbon solar because the pumping negates the carbon savings of the solar by about 20%, according to data in a report called ""Side by side testing of eight solar water heatings"" by DTI UK. However, zero-carbon pumped solar thermal systems use solar electricity which is generated onsite using photovoltaics to pump the fluid and to operate its control electronics. This represents a zero operational carbon footprint and is becoming an important design goal for innovative solar thermal systems.

Levi Yissar  built the first prototype Israeli  solar water heater  and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Due to the abundance of sunlight in  Israel , solar water heaters were used by some 20% of the population by 1967. Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the Israeli  Knesset  passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy  per capita  (3% of the primary national energy consumption). [ 6 ]   During this time, there was some resurgence of interest in solar heating in  North America . Technical innovation has improved performance, life expectancy and ease of use of these systems. Installation of solar hot water heating has become the norm in countries with an abundance of solar radiation, like  Cyprus , Israel [ 7 ]  and  Greece , as well as in  Japan  and  Austria , where there is less.   Solar hot water systems have become popular in  China , where basic models start at around 1,500  yuan  ( US$ 190), much cheaper than in Western countries (around 80% cheaper for a given size of collector). It is said that at least 30 million Chinese households now have one, and that the popularity is due to the efficient evacuated tubes which allow the heaters to function even under gray skies and at temperatures well below freezing. [ 8 ]   In 2005,  Spain  became the first country in the world to require the installation of  photovoltaic  electricity generation in new buildings, and the second (after Israel) to require the installation of solar hot water systems. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Usage   Hot water heated by the sun can be used to:     Heat water (e.g. for sanitary purposes such as showering, washing, ...)   Generate electricity     Designs suitable for hot climates can be much simpler and cheaper, and can be considered an  appropriate technology  for these places. The global solar thermal market is dominated by  China ,  Europe ,  Japan  and  India .   The typical 50 gallon electric water heater uses 11.1 barrels of oil a year, which translates into the same amount oil used by a typical 4 door  sedan  driven by the average consumer.   Electric utility companies often provide electricity by burning and releasing energy from fuels such as  oil ,  coal  and  nuclear energy . An electrical home hot water heater sits on an  electrical grid  and may be driving the use of unclean fuels on the other end of the grid.     [ edit ]   Israel          Solar water heater on a rooftop in  Jerusalem       Israel 's use of solar water heaters is estimated to save the country two million  barrels of oil  a year, and the country has the highest per capita use in the world. [ 10 ] In the 1950s there was a fuel shortage in the new Israeli state, and the government forbid heating water between 10 p.m. and 6 p.m. As the situation worsened, engineer  Levi Yissar  proposed that instead of building more electrical generators, homes should switch to solar water heaters. He built a prototype in his home, and in 1953 he started NerYah Company, Israel's first commercial manufacturer of solar water heaters. [ 5 ]  By 1967 around one in twenty  households  heated their water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. [ 5 ]  However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the  Six Day War  made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters dropped. [ 11 ]  With the  1970s oil crisis ,  Harry Zvi Tabor , the father of  Israel's solar industry , developed the prototype solar water heater that is now used in over 90% of Israeli homes. [ 12 ]   In 1980, the Israeli  Knesset  passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy  per capita  (3% of the primary national energy consumption). [ 13 ]   As of the early 1990s, all new residential buildings were required by the government to install solar water-heating systems, and Israel's National Infrastructure Ministry estimates solar panels for water-heating already satisfy 4% of the country's total energy demand. [ 12 ]  Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Technique          A thermodynamic water heater installed on a house in Belgium       In order to heat water using solar energy, a collector is fastened to the roof of a building, or on a wall facing the sun. In some cases, the collector may be free-standing. The  working fluid  is either pumped (active system) or driven by  natural convection  (passive system) through it.   The collector could be made of a simple  glass  topped  insulated  box with a flat solar absorber made of  sheet metal  attached to  copper  pipes and painted black, or a set of metal tubes surrounded by an evacuated (near  vacuum ) glass  cylinder . In some cases, before the solar energy is absorbed, a  parabolic   mirror  is used to concentrate sunlight on the tube. Some systems are capable of converting light to heat and therefore are not as reliant on outside temperature. [ 15 ]   A simple water heating system would pump cold water out to a collector to be heated, the heated water flows back to a collection  tank . This type of collector can provide enough hot water for an entire  family .   Heat is stored in a hot water tank. The volume of this tank will be larger with solar heating systems in order to allow for bad  weather , and because the  optimum  final temperature for the absorber is lower than a typical immersion or combustion  heater .   The working fluid for the  absorber  may be the hot water from the tank, but more commonly (at least in pumped systems) is a separate loop of fluid containing  anti-freeze  and a  corrosion inhibitor  which delivers heat to the tank through a  heat exchanger  (commonly a  coil  of copper tubing within the tank). Another lower-maintenance concept is the 'drain-back': no anti-freeze is required; instead all the  piping  is sloped to cause water to drain back to the tank. The tank is not  pressurized  and is open to  atmospheric pressure . As soon as the pump shuts off, flow reverses and the pipes empty by the time when  freezing  could occur.   When a solar hot water and hot-water central heating system are used in conjunction, solar heat will either be concentrated in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the  central heating , or the solar heat exchanger will be lower in the tank than the hotter one. However, the main need for central heating is at night when there is no sunlight and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched.   The water from the collector can reach very high temperatures in good sunshine, or if the pump fails. Designs should allow for relief of pressure and excess heat through a heat dump.     [ edit ]   Economics, energy and system costs          A  laundromat  in  California  with panels on the roof providing hot washing water.       In sunny, warm locations, where freeze protection is not necessary, a batch type solar hot water heater can be extremely cost effective. In higher latitudes, there are often additional design requirements for cold weather, which add to system complexity. This has the effect of increasing the  initial  cost (but not the  life-cycle  cost) of a solar hot water system, to a level much higher than a comparable hot water heater of the conventional type. When calculating the total cost to own and operate, a proper analysis will consider that solar energy is free, thus greatly reducing the operating costs, whereas other energy sources, such as gas and electricity, can be quite expensive over time. Thus, when the initial costs of a solar system are properly financed and compared with energy costs, then in many cases the total monthly cost of solar heat can be less than other more conventional types of hot water heaters (and also in conjunction with an existing hot water heater). In addition, federal and local incentives can be significant.   As an example, a 56 ft. 2  solar water heater can cost US $7,500, but that initial cost is reduced to just $3,300 in the US State of  Oregon  due to federal and state incentives. The system will save approximately US $230 per year, with a payback of 14 years. Lower payback periods are possible based on maximizing sun exposure. [ 16 ]  As energy prices rise, payback periods decrease. In cooler locations, solar heating used to be less efficient. Usable amounts of domestic hot water were only available in the summer months, on cloudless days, between April and October. During the winter and on cloudy days, the output was poor. Independent surveys have shown that modern systems do not suffer these limitations. [ 17 ]  There are cases of households in cool climates getting all of their domestic hot water year round from solar alone. [ 18 ]  Systems have been show to efficiently work as far north as  Whitehorse, Yukon  ( latitude  of 60 B 43' N ). [ 19 ]   The installation costs in the  UK  used to be prohibitive, on average about   9,000. This is reduced in more recent years to 3,000, with payback period reduced, with the rise in the gas price, to 12 years  [ 20 ] . As energy prices rise, payback periods shorten accordingly.   According to  ANRE  (a  Flemish  energy agency, subsidised by the Flemish or  Belgian  government, [ 21 ]  a complete,  commercial  (active) solar hot water system composed of a solar collector (3-4 m; this is large enough for 4 people), pipes and tank (again large enough for 4 people) costs around 4000  euro . The installation by a recognised worker costs another 800 euro. [ 22 ]   Electrabel 's home magazine  Eandismagazine  stated in 2008 that a complete system (including 4m 2  of solar collectors and a supply barrel of 200-240 liters) to cost 4500 euro.  [ 23 ]  The system would then pay back itself in 11 years , when the returns are weighed off against a regular  electric   boiler . Calculation was as follows: a saving of 1875  kWh  (which is 50% of the energy requirements in domestic hot water production) x 0.10 euro/kWh = 187, 5 euros. This multiplied by 11.6 years made 2175 euros (or the cost of the system with deducted regional  tax  benefits).   In  Australia , the cost for an average solar hot water system fully installed is between $1,800 and $2,800. This is after  tax rebates  (there is a federal rebate, [ 24 ]  some state rebates and Renewable Energy Certificates [ 25 ] ). According to the Department of Environment and Water Resources [ 26 ] , the yearly electricity savings are between $300 and $700. This brings the payback period to under 2 years in the best case and under 10 years in the worst case.  Easy Being Green  has a program available where consumers can acquire a system for free (with government rebates) excluding the cost of installation.          A monobloc solar heater in  Cirque de Mafate ,  La Runion         [ edit ]   Types   Solar hot water systems can be classified in different ways:     The type of collector used (see below)   The location of the collector - roof mount, ground mount, wall mount [ 27 ]   The location of the storage tank in relation to the collector   The requirement for a pump - active vs. passive   The method of  heat transfer  - open-loop or closed-loop (via heat exchanger)       [ edit ]   Compact systems (passive systems)   A compact system also known as a  monobloc  has a tank for the heated water and a solar collector mounted on the same chasis. Typically these systems will function by natural convection ( thermosiphon ) or heatpipes to transfer the heat energy from the collector to the tank.          A integrated collector storage system       A special type of compact system is the Integrated Collector Storage (ICS or Batch Heater) where the tank acts as both storage and solar collector. Batch heaters are basically thin rectilinear tanks with glass in front of it generally in or on house wall or roof. They are seldom pressurised and usually depend on gravity flow to deliver their water. They are simple, efficient and less costly than intense plate and tube collectors but only suitable in moderate climates with good sunshine.  [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  A step up from the ICS is the  Convection Heat Storage Unit . These are plate type intense collectors with built-in insulated tanks. The unit uses convection (movement of hot water upward) to move the water from heater to tank. Neither pumps or electricity are used. It is more efficient than an ICS as the intense collector heats a small(er) amount of water that is constantly rising to the tank. It can be used in areas with less sunshine than the ICS.   Another system is the  Copper Cricket .  [ 30 ] [ 31 ]  The Copper Cricket is a special system which can be implemented into an existing (e.g. electric) hot water heater. It is manufactured by companies such as  Sage Advance Corporation .  [ 32 ]  The device works without any pumps or electricity. [ 33 ] [ 34 ]          A passive open loop system       Direct  ('open loop') compact systems, if made of metals are not suitable for cold climates. At night the remaining water can freeze and damage the panels, and the storage tank is exposed to the outdoor temperatures that will cause excessive heat losses on cold days. Some compact systems have a  primary circuit . The primary circuit includes the collectors and the external part of the tank. Instead of water, a non-toxic antifreeze is used. When this liquid is heated up, it flows to the external part of the tank and transfers the heat to the water placed inside. ('closed loop'). However, direct ('open loop') systems are slightly cheaper and more efficient.   A compact system can save up to 4.5  tonnes  annually of  greenhouse gas emissions . In order to achieve the aims of the  Kyoto Protocol , several countries are offering subsidies to the end user. Some systems can work for up to 25 years with minimum maintenance. These kinds of systems can be redeemed in six years, and achieve a positive balance of energy (energy used to build them minus energy they save) of 1.5 years. Most part of the year, when the electric heating element is not working, these systems do not use any external source for power (as water flows due to thermosiphon principle).   Flat  solar thermal collectors  are usually used, but compact systems using vacuum tube collectors are available on the market. These generally give a higher heat yield per square meter in colder climates but cost more than flat plate collector systems.     [ edit ]   Pumped systems (active systems)          Schematic of an active solar heating system              Schematic of an active solar heating system       How the solar water heating system is pumped and controlled determines whether it is a zero carbon or a low carbon system. Low carbon systems principally use electricity to circulate the fluid through the collector. The use of electricity typically reduces the carbon savings of a system by 10% to 20%.   Conventional low carbon system designs use a mains powered circulation pump whenever the hot water tank is positioned below the solar panels. Most systems in northern Europe are of this type. The storage tank is placed inside the building, and thus requires a controller that measures when the water is hotter in the panels than in the tank. The system also requires a pump for transferring the fluid between the parts. [ 35 ]   The electronic controllers used by some systems permit a wide range of functionality such as measurement of the energy produced; more sophisticated safety functions; thermostatic and time-clock control of auxiliary heat, hot water circulation loops, or others; display or transfer of error messages or alarms; remote display panels; and remote or local datalogging.   Newer zero carbon solar water heating systems are powered by solar electric (photovoltaic or PV) pumps. These typically use a 5-20W PV panel which faces in the same direction as the main solar heating panel and a small, low power  diaphragm pump  or centrifugal pump to circulate the water.   The most commonly used solar collector is the insulated glazed flat panel. Less expensive panels, like polypropylene panels (for swimming pools) or higher-performing ones like  evacuated tube  collectors, are sometimes used.     [ edit ]   Types of thermal collector             It has been suggested that this article or section be  merged  into  Solar thermal collector . ( Discuss )       There are three main kinds of  solar thermal collectors  in common use. In order of increasing cost they are: Formed Plastic Collectors, Flat Collectors, and Evacuated Tube Collectors. The efficiency of the system is directly related to heat losses from the collector surface (efficiency being defined as the proportion of heating energy that can be usefully obtained from insulation). Heat losses are predominantly governed by the thermal gradient between the temperature of the collector surface and the ambient temperature. Efficiency decreases when either the ambient temperature falls or as the collector temperature increases. This decrease in efficiency can be mitigated by increasing the insulation of the unit by sealing the unit in glass e.g. flat collectors or providing a vacuum seal e.g. evacuated tube collector. The choice of collector is determined by the heating requirements and environmental conditions in which it is employed. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]   [ 39 ] [ 40 ]     [ edit ]   Formed plastic collector   Formed plastic collectors (such as  polypropylene ,  EPDM  or  PET   plastics ) consist of tubes or formed panels through which water is circulated and heated by the sun's radiation. These are often used for extending the swimming season in swimming pools. In some countries, heating an open-air swimming pool with non-renewable energy sources is not allowed, and then these inexpensive systems offer a good solution. This panel is not suitable for year-round uses like providing hot water for home use, primarily due to its lack of insulation which reduces its effectiveness greatly when the ambient air temperature is lower than the temperature of the fluid being heated.     [ edit ]   Flat plate collector          A flat plate collector       A flat plate collector consists of a thin absorber sheet (of thermally stable polymers, aluminum, steel or  copper , to which a black or selective coating is applied) backed by a grid or coil of fluid tubing and placed in an insulated casing with a glass or polycarbonate cover.   Fluid is circulated, using either mains or solar electricity, through the tubing to remove the heat from the absorber and to transport it to an insulated water tank, sometimes directly or otherwise to a  heat exchanger  or to some other device for using the heated fluid. Some fabricants have a completely flooded absorber consisting of 2 sheets of metal stamped to produce a circulation zone. Because the heat exchange area is greater they may be marginally more efficient than traditional absorbers. [ 41 ]   As an alternative to metal collectors, new polymer flat plate collectors are now being produced in Europe. These may be wholly  polymer , or they may be metal plates behind which are freeze-tolerant water channels made of silicone rubber instead of metal. Polymers, being flexible and therefore freeze-tolerant, are able to contain plain water instead of antifreeze, so that in some cases they are able to plumb directly into existing water tanks instead of needing the tank to be replaced with one using heat exchangers. By dispensing with a heat exchanger in these flat plate panel, temperatures need not be quite so high for the circulation system to be switched on, so such direct circulation panels, whether polymer or otherwise, can be somewhat more efficient, particularly at low light levels.   As with evacuated tubes, most flat plate collectors have a life expectancy of over 25 years.     [ edit ]   Evacuated tube collector          Evacuated (or vacuum) tubes panel.       Evacuated tube collectors are made of a series of modular tubes, mounted in parallel, whose number can be added to or reduced as hot water delivery needs change. This type of collector consists of rows of parallel transparent glass tubes, each of which contains an absorber tube (in place of the absorber plate to which metal tubes are attached in a flat-plate collector). In some cases, the tubes are covered with a special light-modulating coating. In an evacuated tube collector, sunlight passing through an outer glass tube heats the absorber tube contained within it. The absorber can either consist of copper (glass-metal) or specially-coated glass tubing (glass-glass). The glass-metal evacuated tubes are typically sealed at the manifold end, and the absorber is actually sealed in the vacuum, thus the fact that the absorber and heat pipe are dissimilar metals creates no corrosion problems. Some systems use foam insulation in the manifold. Soda-lime glass is used in the higher quality evacuated tubes manufacture.   Lower quality evacuated tube systems use the glass coated absorber. Due to the extreme temperature difference of the glass under stagnation temperatures, the glass sometimes shatters. The glass is a lower quality boron silicate material and the aluminum absorber and copper heat pipe are slid down inside the open top end of the tube. Moisture entering the manifold around the sheet metal casing is eventually absorbed by the glass fibre insulation and then finds its way down into the tubes. This leads to corrosion at the absorber/heat pipe interface area, also freeze ruptures of the tube itself if the tube fills sufficiently with water.   Two types of tube collectors are distinguished by their heat transfer method: the simplest pumps a heat transfer fluid (water or  antifreeze ) through a U-shaped copper tube placed in each of the glass collector tubes. The second type uses a sealed  heat pipe  that contains a liquid that vapourises as it is heated. The vapour rises to a heat-transfer bulb that is positioned outside the collector tube in a pipe through which a second heat transfer liquid (the water or antifreeze) is pumped. For both types, the heated liquid then circulates through a heat exchanger and gives off its heat to water that is stored in a storage tank (which itself may be kept warm partially by sunlight). Evacuated tube collectors heat to higher temperatures, with some models providing considerably more solar yield per square metre than flat panels. However, they are more expensive and fragile than flat panels. Evacuated heat tubes perform better than flat plate collectors in cold climates because they only rely on the light they receive and not the outside temperature. [ 42 ]  The high stagnation temperatures can cause antifreeze to break down, so careful consideration must be used if selecting this type of system in temperate climates.Tubes come in different levels of quality so the different kinds have to be examined as well. High quality units can efficiently absorb diffuse solar radiation present in cloudy conditions and are unaffected by wind. They also have the same performance in similar light conditions summer and winter. [ 43 ]   For a given absorber area, evacuated tubes can maintain their efficiency over a wide range of ambient temperatures and heating requirements. The absorber area only occupied about 50% of the collector panel on early designs, however this has changed as the technology has advanced to maximize the absorption area. In extremely hot climates, flat-plate collectors will generally be a more cost-effective solution than evacuated tubes. When employed in arrays of 20 to 30 or more, the efficient but costly evacuated tube collectors have net benefit in winter and also give real advantage in the summer months. They are well suited to extremely cold ambient temperatures and work well in situations of consistently low-light. They are also used in industrial applications, where high water temperatures or steam need to be generated. Properly designed evacuated tubes have a life expectancy of over 25 years which greatly adds to their value.     [ edit ]   Solar thermal cooling       Main article:  Solar thermal cooling       Solar thermal cooling  can be achieved via  absorption refrigeration cycles ,  desiccant  cycles and solar-mechanical processes. [ 44 ]   The absorption cycle solar cooling system works like a  refrigerator  in that it uses hot water to compress a gas that, once expanded, will absorb energy, which cools the air. The main problem currently is that the absorber machine works with liquid at 90 C, a fairly high temperature to be reached with pumped solar panels with no auxiliary power supply. [ citation needed ]   The same pumped solar thermal installation can be used for producing hot water for the whole year. It can also be used for cooling in the summer and partially heating the building in winter.     [ edit ]   DIY systems   With an ever-rising  do-it-yourself -community and their increasing environmental awareness, people have begun building their own (small-scale) solar hot water systems from scratch or buying easy to install kits. Plans for solar hot water systems are available on the  Internet . [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]  and people have set about building them for their own domestic requirements. DIY solar hot water systems are usually much cheaper than commercial ones, and installation costs can sometimes be avoided as well. The DIY-solar hot water systems are being used both in the developed world, as in the developing world, to generate hot water. [ 50 ]  Rather than build systems from scratch, many DIY solar enthusiasts are buying simple off-the-shelf solar DIY kits. In particular the new freeze tolerant, zero-carbon PV pumped systems, are becoming common in parts of Europe, since their simplicity enables them to be plumbed in quickly and safely without the need of a mains electrician.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

The grand idea is to have a membership site where all membership dues are donated to community projects that involve the use and implementation of both solar and wind energy solutions.    A place when together the community can decide what projects are worthwhile and which projects we can fund that will changes the lives of individuals now and make the world a cleaner place for our children and theirs.    These goals will require people from all over the world from different backgrounds and places.     If you believe that you would like to be a part of something bigger than yourself and would like to help there are a number of ways to help me get this site off the ground.    First if you have a background in solar or wind energy and would like to contribute articles for the site please sign up and start submitting as soon as you can.    If you have a website of your own then please link to us.    You can become active on the community forum which will encourage others to become active.    You can leave comments on any of the articles you see on the site, that also encourages participation.    Lastly when we have a community of people and turn the site into a membership site you can join and help us all determine where we as a community can make the biggest difference.     There is no question in my mind that we will succeed despite the pressures of large corporations.    And there is no doubt that one small community of people who actually want to do more than talk about problems can make the changes necessary to make the world a better place for all of us to live.    Welcome and please make any contribution you can to help this movement grow.

Solar cells have been converting energy for quite a long time now however technology is just now allowing many people to use solar energy to power bigger things like their homes. The reason this method of getting electricity is gaining more and more support is not only because of technology but people see the many benefits of using solar power. The creation of solar cells is a very complicated process however how they work is rather easy to understand.

Solar heaters have to have certain things to work right. They must have  solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat water for home or business use, for swimming pools, under floor heating or as an energy input for space heating and cooling and industrial applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Solar Power Panels                                                                                         Read more...                                                                                                                                                            Written by  Ace ,                                                                                                                                Views : 187                                                                                      Published in :  Solar ,   Residential Solar                                         Tags :  Solar ,  Residential Solar ,  Solar Power Panels                                          I have been trying to figure out how to justify putting solar power panels on my house for about five years.    I keep hoping that the price will fall or a new technology will come out that could justify the expense.    I really want to live off grid but every time I do the calculations the numbers just don’t add up.    First of all there is a finite life span to the Silicon solar power panels that are being produced today.    They have a 25 year guarantee but it is also made clear that they will drop off in production of electricity over the course of time.    So the rating they have at day one will decrease every year they are installed until they eventually give out completely.

These  ecological effects of biodiversity  in turn affect both  climate change  through enhanced  greenhouse gases ,  aerosols  and loss of land cover, and biological diversity, causing a rapid loss of  ecosystems  and  extinctions  of  species  and local populations. The current rate of extinction is sometimes considered a  mass extinction , with current species extinction rates on the order of 100 to 1000 times as high as in the past. [ 1 ]   The two main areas where the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem function have been studied are the relationship between diversity and productivity, and the relationship between diversity and community stability. More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive (in terms of  biomass  production) than are less diverse communities, and they appear to be more stable in the face of perturbations.   Also animals that inhabit an area may alter the surviving conditions by factors assimilated by climate.

Biodiversity is not easily defined, but may be thought of as the number and/or evenness of  genes , species, and ecosystems in a  region . This definition includes  genetic diversity , or the diversity of genes within a species,  species diversity , or the diversity of species within a  habitat  or region, and ecosystem diversity, or the diversity of habitats within a region.   Two things commonly measured in relation to changes in diversity are productivity and  stability . Productivity is a measure of ecosystem function. It is generally measured by taking the total aboveground  biomass  of all plants in an area. Many assume that it can be used as a general indicator of ecosystem function and that total resource use and other indicators of ecosystem function are correlated with productivity.   Stability is much more difficult to define, but can be generally thought of in two ways. General stability of a population is a measure that assumes stability is higher if there is less of a chance of extinction. This kind of stability is generally measured by measuring the  variability  of aggregate community properties, like total biomass, over time  [ 2 ]  The other definition of stability is a measure of resilience and resistance, where an ecosystem that returns quickly to an  equilibrium  after a perturbation or resists invasion is thought of as more stable than one that doesn't. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Productivity and stability as indicators of ecosystem health   The importance of stability in community ecology is clear. An unstable ecosystem will be more likely to lose species. Thus, if there is indeed a link between diversity and stability, it is likely that losses of diversity could feedback on themselves, causing even more losses of species. Productivity, on the other hand, has a less clear importance in community ecology. In managed areas like  cropland , and in areas where animals are grown or caught, increasing productivity increases the  economic  success of the area and implies that the area has become more efficient, leading to possible long term resource  sustainability . [ 4 ]  It is more difficult to find the importance of productivity in natural ecosystems. This will be discussed in more detail later.     [ edit ]   Does biodiversity have value?   Beyond the value biodiversity has in regulating and stabilizing ecosystem processes, there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole. Losing species means losing potential  foods ,  medicines , industrial products, and  tourism , all of which have a direct economic effect on peoples lives. [ 5 ]  For more information, see the  economic role of biodiversity .     [ edit ]   Effects of diversity on community productivity     [ edit ]   How species diversity may influence productivity     Complementarity  Plant species coexistence is thought to be the result of  niche  partitioning, or differences in resource requirements among species. By complementarity, a more diverse plant community should be able to use resources more completely, and thus be more productive. [ 4 ] [ 6 ]  Also called niche differentiation, this mechanism is a central principle in the  functional group  approach, which breaks species diversity down into functional components.  [ 7 ] [ 8 ]   Facilitation   Facilitation  is a mechanism whereby certain species help or allow other species to grow by modifying the environment in a way that is favorable to a co-occurring species. [ 9 ]  Plants can interact through an intermediary like nitrogen, water, temperature, space, or interactions with weeds or herbivores among others. Some examples of facilitation include large desert perennials acting as nurse plants, aiding the establishment of young neighbors of other species by alleviating water and temperature stress, [ 10 ]  and nutrient enrichment by nitrogen-fixers such as legumes.   The Sampling Effect  The sampling effect of diversity can be thought of as having a greater chance of including a species of greatest inherent productivity in a plot that is more diverse. This provides for a composition effect on productivity, rather than diversity being a direct cause. However, the sampling effect may in fact be a compilation of different effects. The sampling effect can be separated into the greater likelihood of selecting a species that is 1) adapted well to particular site conditions, or 2) of a greater inherent productivity. Additionally, one can add to the sampling effect a greater likelihood of including 3) a pair of species that highly complement each other, or 4) a certain species with a large facilitative effect on other members of the community.       [ edit ]   Review of data   Field experiments to test the degree to which diversity affects community productivity have found many things, but many long term studies in  grassland  ecosystems have found that diversity does indeed enhance the productivity of ecosystems.  [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   [ 13 ]  Evidence of the relationship has also been found in grassland microcosms. However, these different studies have come to different conclusions as to whether the cause was due more to diversity or to species composition. Recent mathematical models have highlighted the importance of ecological context in unraveling this problem. Some models have indicated the importance of  disturbance  rates and spatial  heterogeneity  of the environment, [ 14 ]  others have indicated that the time since disturbance and the habitat's carrying capacity can cause differing relationships. [ 15 ]  Each ecological context should yield not only a different relationship, but a different contribution to the relationship due to diversity and to composition.     [ edit ]   Implications for ecology/future research   In order to correctly identify the consequences of diversity on productivity and other ecosystem processes, many things must happen. First, it is imperative that scientists stop looking for a single relationship. It is obvious now from the models, the data, and the theory that there is no one overarching effect of diversity on productivity. Scientists must try to quantify the differences between composition effect and diversity effects, as many experiments never quantify the final realized species diversity (instead only counting numbers of species of seeds planted) and confound a sampling effect for facilitators (a compositional factor) with diversity effects.   Relative amounts of  overyielding  (or how much more a species grows when grown with other species than it does in monoculture) should be used rather than absolute amounts as relative overyielding can give clues as to the mechanism by which diversity is influencing productivity, however if experimental protocols are incomplete, one may be able to indicate the existence of a complementary or facilitative effect in the experiment, but not be able to recognize its cause. Experimenters should know what the goal of their experiment is, that is, whether it is meant to inform natural or managed ecosystems, as the sampling effect may only be a real effect of diversity in natural ecosystems (managed ecosystems are composed to maximize complementarity and facilitation regardless of species number). By knowing this, they should be able to choose spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for their experiment. Lastly, to resolve the diversity-function debate, it is advisable that experiments be done with large amounts of spatial and resource heterogeneity and environmental fluctuation over time, as these types of experiments should be able to demonstrate the diversity-function relationship more easily. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Effects of diversity on community stability     [ edit ]   How species diversity may influence community stability     Averaging Effect  If all species have differential responses to changes in the ecosystem over time, then the averaging of these responses will cause a more temporally stable ecosystem if more species are in the ecosystem. [ 2 ] . This effect is a  statistical  effect due to summing  random   variables .   Negative Covariance Effect  If some species do better when other species are not doing well, then when there are more species in the ecosystem, their overall  variance  will be lower than if there were fewer species in the system. This lower variance indicates higher stability.  [ 16 ]  This effect is a consequence of  competition  as highly competitive species will negatively  covary .   Insurance Effect  If an ecosystem contains more species then it will have a greater likelihood of having  redundant  stabilizing species, and it will have a greater number of species that respond differently to perturbations. This will enhance an ecosystem's ability to  buffer  perturbations. [ 17 ]   Resistance to Invasion  Diverse communities may use resources more completely than simple communities because of a diversity effect for complementarity. Thus  invaders  may have reduced success in diverse ecosystems, or there may be a reduced likelihood that an invading species will introduce a new property or process to a diverse ecosystem. [ 18 ]   [ 8 ]   [ 19 ]   Resistance to Disease  A decreased number of competing plant species may allow the abundances of other species to increase, facilitating the spread of diseases of those species.  [ 18 ]   [ 19 ]   [ 20 ]       [ edit ]   Review of temporal stability data   Models have predicted that  empirical  relationships between  temporal  variation of community productivity and species diversity are indeed real, and that they almost have to be. Some temporal stability data can be almost completely explained by the averaging effect by constructing null models to test the data against. [ 2 ] [ 11 ]  Competition, which causes negative covariances, only serves to strengthen these relationships.     [ edit ]   Review of resistance/resilience stability data   This area is more contentious than the area of temporal stability, mostly because some have tried generalizing the findings of the temporal stability models and theory to stability in general. While the relationship between temporal variations in productivity and diversity has a mathematical cause, which will allow the relationship to be seen much more often than not, it is not the case with resistance/resilience stability. Some experimenters have seen a  correlation  between diversity and reduced invasibility, though many have also seen the opposite.  [ 21 ]  The correlation between diversity and disease is also tenuous, though theory and data do seem to support it. [ 20 ]     [ edit ]   Implications for ecology/future research   In order to more fully understand the effects of diversity on the temporal stability of ecosystems it is necessary to recognize that they are bound to occur. By constructing null models to test the data against (as in Doak et al. 1998 [ 2 ] ) it becomes possible to find situations and ecological contexts where ecosystems become more or less stable than they should be. Finding these contexts would allow for mechanistic studies into why these ecosystems are more stable, which may allow for applications in  conservation  management.   More importantly more complete experiments into whether diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents as invasion and disease are two important factors that lead to species extinctions in the present day.     [ edit ]   Theory and preliminary effects from examining food webs   One major problem with both the diversity-productivity and diversity-stability debates discussed up to this point is that both focus on interactions at just a single  trophic level . That is, they are concerned with only one level of the  food web , namely plants. Other research, unconcerned with the effects of diversity, has demonstrated strong top-down forcing of ecosystems (see  keystone species ). There is very little actual data available regarding the effects of different food webs, but theory helps us in this area. First, if a food web in an ecosystem has a lot of weak  interactions  between different species, then it should have more stable populations and the community as a whole should be more stable. [ 3 ]  If upper levels of the web are more diverse, then there will be less  biomass  in the lower levels and if lower levels are more diverse they will better be able to resist  consumption  and be more stable in the face of consumption. Also, top-down forcing should be reduced in less diverse ecosystems because of the bias for species in higher trophic levels to go extinct first. [ 22 ]  Lastly, it has recently been shown that  consumers  can dramatically change the biodiversity-productivity-stability relationships that are implied by plants alone. [ 23 ]  Thus, it will be important in the future to incorporate food web theory into the future study of the effects of biodiversity. In addition this complexity will need to be addressed when designing biodiversity management plans.     [ edit ]   Conclusions   It is imperative that we come to a realization that there is no single overarching effect of diversity on either productivity or stability. The realized effects will depend heavily on environmental context and the time scale over which the effects are studied. However, it has become obvious that biodiversity is indeed important for both managed and natural ecosystems, though the relative contributions of diversity and composition remain unclear. It is therefore necessary for legislators to understand the basic science in order to maintain diversity at its current levels. If current human growth and resource management patterns do not change, it is likely that we will lose many important species, and the ecosystems of the world may never recover.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common source of  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon  burning in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The reason for  Mars 's red color is thought to be an iron-oxide-rich soil.     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidises readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes       Main article:  Allotropes of iron       Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallises at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or austenite. At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetised iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetised iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterised by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. They are used for structural purposes, as their alloy content raises their cost and necessitates justification of their use. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .   Iron(III) ammonium oxalate (Fe(NH 4 ) 3 (C 2 O 4 ) 4 ) is used in  blueprints .   Iron(III) arsenate (FeAsO 4 ) is used in  insecticide .   Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]   Iron-Fluorine complex (FeF 6 ) 3-  is found in solutions containing both Fe(III)  ions  and  fluoride   ions .   Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History       Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy              The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with a smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore     See also:  Iron ore            Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace       Main article:  Blast furnace              Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes       Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks       Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidise some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content. The higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes       Main article:  Isotopes of iron       Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b           Main article:  Human iron metabolism       Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron -- which binds non-specifically to many cellular components -- can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables (haem iron), [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption. High blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.

Iron is a  group 8  and  period 4 element . Iron is lustrous and silvery in color. It is soft, about 80  Brinell , [ 1 ]  relative to steel, which is about 140 Brinell. [ 2 ]  It is one of the few  ferromagnetic  elements.   Iron-56 is the second heaviest stable isotope produced by the  alpha process  in  stellar nucleosynthesis , the heaviest being  nickel-62 ; heavier elements require a  supernova  for their formation. Iron is the most abundant element in the core of  red giants , and is the most abundant metal in  iron meteorites  and in the dense metal cores of planets such as  Earth . Iron and iron  alloys  are also the most common  ferromagnetic  materials in everyday use.

Iron is the sixth most  abundant element  in the  universe , formed as the final act of  nucleosynthesis  by  carbon   fusing  in massive stars. While it makes up about 5% of the  Earth's crust , the  earth's core  is believed to consist largely of an iron- nickel  alloy constituting 35% of the mass of the Earth as a whole. Iron is consequently the most abundant element on Earth, but only the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust. [ 3 ]  Most of the iron in the crust is found combined with  oxygen  as  iron oxide  minerals such as  hematite  and  magnetite . About 1 in 20  meteorites  consist of the unique iron-nickel minerals  taenite  (3580% iron) and  kamacite  (9095% iron). Although rare,  iron meteorites  are the major form of natural metallic iron on the Earth's surface.   The red color of the surface of  Mars  is thought to derive from an iron oxide-rich  regolith .     [ edit ]   Characteristics   Iron is a  metal  extracted mainly from the  iron ore   hematite . It oxidizes readily in air and water to form  Fe 2 O 3  and is rarely found as a free element. In order to obtain elemental iron,  oxygen  and other impurities must be removed by chemical  reduction . The properties of iron can be modified by  alloying  it with various other metals and some non-metals, notably  carbon  and  silicon  to form  steels .   Nuclei of iron atoms have some of the highest binding energies per nucleon, surpassed only by the  nickel isotope   62 Ni. The universally most abundant of the highly stable nuclides is, however,  56 Fe. This is formed by nuclear fusion in stars. Although a further tiny energy gain could be extracted by synthesizing  62 Ni, conditions in stars are unsuitable for this process to be favoured. Elemental distribution on Earth greatly favors iron over nickel, and also presumably in supernova element production. [ 4 ]   Iron (as Fe 2+ ,  ferrous ion ) is a necessary  trace element  used by almost all living organisms. The only exceptions are several organisms that live in iron-poor environments and have evolved to use different elements in their metabolic processes, such as manganese instead of iron for catalysis, or  hemocyanin  instead of hemoglobin. Iron-containing enzymes, usually containing  heme  prosthetic groups, participate in catalysis of oxidation reactions in biology, and in transport of a number of soluble gases. See  hemoglobin ,  cytochrome , and  catalase .     [ edit ]   Allotropes   Main article:  Allotropes of iron   Iron represents perhaps the best-known example of  allotropy  in a metal. There are three allotropic forms of iron, known as alpha, gamma, and delta.   As molten iron cools down it crystallizes at 1538 C into its delta allotrope, which has a  body-centered cubic  (BCC) crystal structure. As it cools further its  crystal structure  changes to  face-centered cubic  (FCC) at 1394 C, when it is known as gamma-iron, or  austenite . At 912 C the crystal structure again becomes BCC as alpha-iron, or  ferrite , is formed, and at 770 C (the Curie point, Tc) the iron becomes  magnetic . As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, but there is a change in ""domain structure"", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain are in the same direction; however, in neighbouring domains they point in various directions and thus cancel out. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of all the domains are all aligned, so that the magnetic effects of neighbouring domains reinforce each other. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about one thousandth of a centimetre across.   Iron is of most importance when mixed with certain other metals and with carbon to form steels. There are many types of steels, all with different properties; and an understanding of the properties of the  allotropes of iron  is key to the manufacture of good quality steels.   Alpha iron, also known as ferrite, is the most stable form of iron at normal temperatures. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon (no more than 0.021% by mass at 910 C).   Above 912 C and up to 1401 C alpha iron undergoes a  phase transition  from body-centred cubic to the face-centred cubic configuration of gamma iron, also called  austenite . This is similarly soft and metallic but can dissolve considerably more carbon (as much as 2.04% by mass at 1146 C). This form of iron is used in the type of  stainless steel  used for making cutlery, and hospital and food-service equipment.     [ edit ]   Applications   Iron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for 95% of worldwide metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools,  automobiles , the  hulls  of large  ships , and structural components for  buildings . Since pure iron is quite soft, it is most commonly used in the form of  steel . Some of the forms in which iron is produced commercially include:     Pig iron  has 3.54.5% carbon [ 5 ]  and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as  sulfur ,  silicon  and  phosphorus . Its only significance is that of an intermediate step on the way from  iron ore  to  cast iron  and  steel .   Cast iron  contains 24%  carbon , 16%  silicon , and small amounts of  manganese . Contaminants present in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, have been reduced to an acceptable level. It has a melting point in the range of 14201470 K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly, dependent upon the form  carbon  takes in the alloy. ""White"" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of  cementite , or iron carbide. This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. In  grey iron  the carbon exists free as fine flakes of  graphite , and also renders the material brittle due to the stress-raising nature of the sharp edged flakes of graphite. A newer variant of grey iron, referred to as  ductile iron  is specially treated with trace amounts of  magnesium  to alter the shape of graphite to spheroids, or nodules, vastly increasing the toughness and strength of the material.   Wrought iron  contains less than 0.25% carbon. [ 5 ]  It is a tough, malleable product, but not as fusible as pig iron. If honed to an edge, it loses it quickly. Wrought iron is characterized by the presence of fine fibers of  slag  entrapped in the metal. Wrought iron is more corrosion resistant than steel. It has been almost completely replaced by  mild steel  for traditional ""wrought iron"" products and  blacksmithing . Mild steel does not have the same corrosion resistance but is cheaper and more widely available.   Carbon steel  contains 2.0%  carbon  or less, [ 6 ]  with small amounts of  manganese ,  sulfur ,  phosphorus , and  silicon .   Alloy steels  contain varying amounts of carbon as well as other metals, such as  chromium ,  vanadium ,  molybdenum ,  nickel ,  tungsten , etc. Their alloy content raises their cost, and so they can usually only be justified for specialist uses. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low alloy steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.   Iron(III) oxides  are used in the production of  magnetic storage  media in computers. They are often mixed with other compounds, and retain their magnetic properties in solution.     The main disadvantage of iron and steel is that pure iron, and most of its alloys, suffer badly from  rust  if not protected in some way.  Painting ,  galvanization ,  passivation , plastic coating and  bluing  are some techniques used to protect iron from rust by excluding  water  and  oxygen  or by sacrificial protection.     [ edit ]   Iron compounds          Iron chloride hexahydrate         Iron oxides (FeO, Fe 3 O 4 , and Fe 2 O 3 ) are  ores  used for iron production (see  bloomery  and  blast furnace ). They are also used in the  Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters [ citation needed ]   Iron(III) acetate (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 3  is used in the  dyeing  of  cloth .

Iron(III) chloride  (FeCl 3 ) is used: in  water  purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in  paints , as an additive in animal feed, and as an etching material for engravement,  photography  and printed circuits.   Iron(III) chromate (Fe 2 (CrO 4 ) 3 ) is used as a yellow pigment for paints and  ceramic .   Iron(III) hydroxide  (Fe(OH) 3 ) is used as a brown  pigment  for  rubber  and in water purification systems.   Iron(III) phosphate  (FePO 4 ) is used in  fertilizer  and as an additive in human and animal food.   Iron(II) acetate  (Fe(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2  is used in the dyeing of fabrics and  leather , and as a  wood  preservative.   Iron(II) gluconate  (Fe(C 6 H 11 O 7 ) 2 ) is used as a dietary supplement in  iron pills .   Iron(II) oxalate (FeC 2 O 4 ) is used as yellow pigment for paints,  plastics ,  glass  and ceramic, and in  photography .   Iron(II) sulfate  (FeSO 4 ) is used in water purification and sewage treatment systems, as a  catalyst  in the production of  ammonia , as an ingredient in fertilizer and  herbicide , as an additive in animal feed, in wood preservative and as an additive to  flour  to increase iron levels. Experimental  iron fertilization  of areas of the ocean using  iron(II) sulfate  has proven successful in increasing  plankton  growth.

Potassium  Ferrate  (K 2 FeO 4 ) contains a tetra-oxo anion of iron in its highest known  Oxidation State .       [ edit ]   History   Main article:  History of ferrous metallurgy          The symbol for  Mars  has been used since ancient times to represent iron.              The Delhi  iron pillar  is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of India. The iron pillar at Delhi has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.              The  puddling  process of smelting iron  ore  to make  wrought iron  from  pig iron , with the right illustration displaying men working a  blast furnace , from the  Tiangong Kaiwu  encyclopedia, published in 1637 by  Song Yingxing .       The first iron used by mankind during  prehistory  came from meteors. The  smelting  of iron in  bloomeries  probably began in  Anatolia ,  India  or the  Caucasus  in the second millennium BC or the later part of the preceding one. [ citation needed ]   Cast iron  was first produced in  China  about 550 BC, but not in Europe until the medieval period. During the  medieval  period, means were found in Europe of producing  wrought iron  from  cast iron  (in this context known as  pig iron ) using  finery forges . For all these processes,  charcoal  was required as fuel.   Steel  (with smaller carbon content than  pig iron  but more than  wrought iron ) was first  produced in antiquity . New methods of producing it by  carburizing  bars of iron in the  cementation process  were devised in the 17th century AD. In the  Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel. In the late 1850s,  Henry Bessemer  invented a new steelmaking process, involving blowing air through molten pig iron, to produce mild steel. This and other 19th century and later processes have led to  wrought iron  no longer being produced.     [ edit ]   Production of iron from iron ore   See also:  Iron ore          Iron ore pellets from  Kiruna ,  Sweden .       The production of iron or steel is a process unless the desired final product is  cast iron . The first stage is to produce  pig iron  in a  blast furnace . The second is to make  wrought iron  or  steel  from pig iron by a further process.     [ edit ]   Blast furnace   Main article:  Blast furnace          Iron output in 2005       Ninety percent of all  mining  of metallic  ores  is for the extraction of iron. Industrially, iron is produced starting from  iron ores , principally  hematite  (nominally Fe 2 O 3 ) and  magnetite  (Fe 3 O 4 ) by a  carbothermic  reaction (reduction with  carbon ) in a  blast furnace  at temperatures of about 2000 C. In a blast furnace, iron ore, carbon in the form of  coke , and a  flux  such as  limestone  (which is used to remove impurities in the ore which would otherwise clog the furnace with solid material) are fed into the top of the furnace, while a blast of heated  air  is forced into the furnace at the bottom.   In the furnace, the  coke  reacts with  oxygen  in the air blast to produce  carbon monoxide :     2  C  +  O 2   2  CO     The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore (in the  chemical equation  below, hematite) to molten iron, becoming  carbon dioxide  in the process:     3  CO  +  Fe 2 O 3   2 Fe + 3  CO 2     The flux is present to melt impurities in the ore, principally  silicon dioxide   sand  and other  silicates . Common fluxes include limestone (principally  calcium carbonate ) and dolomite (calcium-magnesium carbonate). Other fluxes may be used depending on the impurities that need to be removed from the ore. In the heat of the furnace the limestone flux decomposes to  calcium oxide  (quicklime):     CaCO 3    CaO  +  CO 2     Then calcium oxide combines with silicon dioxide to form a  slag .     CaO  +  SiO 2    CaSiO 3     The slag melts in the heat of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and apertures in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron once cooled, is called  pig iron , while the slag can be used as a material in  road  construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for  agriculture . [ citation needed ]          How Iron was extracted in the 19th century              This heap of  iron ore  pellets will be used in  steel  production.       In 2005, approximately 1,544 Mt (million  metric tons ) of iron ore were produced worldwide. China was the top producer of iron ore with at least one-fourth world share followed by Brazil, Australia and India, reports the  British Geological Survey .     [ edit ]   Further processes   Main articles:  Steelmaking  and  Ironworks   Pig iron is not pure iron, but has 4-5% carbon dissolved in it with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus and manganese. As the carbon is the major impurity, the iron (pig iron) becomes brittle and hard. This form of iron is used to  cast  articles in  foundries  such as stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts and rails.   Alternatively pig iron may be made into  steel  (with up to about 2% carbon) or  wrought iron  (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including  finery forges ,  puddling  furnaces,  Bessemer converters ,  open hearth furnaces ,  basic oxygen furnaces , and  electric arc furnaces . In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.   The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content, the higher the proportion of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the ductility. The properties of the steel can also be changed by tempering it. To harden the steel, it is heated to red hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. This steel is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.     [ edit ]   Isotopes   Main article:  Isotopes of iron   Naturally occurring iron consists of four  isotopes : 5.845% of radioactive  54 Fe (half-life: >3.110 22  years), 91.754% of stable  56 Fe, 2.119% of stable  57 Fe and 0.282% of stable  58 Fe.  60 Fe is an  extinct radionuclide  of long  half-life  (1.5 million years).   Much of the past work on measuring the isotopic composition of Fe has centered on determining  60 Fe variations due to processes accompanying  nucleosynthesis  (i.e.,  meteorite  studies) and ore formation. In the last decade however, advances in  mass spectrometry  technology have allowed the detection and quantification of minute, naturally occurring variations in the ratios of the  stable isotopes  of iron. Much of this work has been driven by the  Earth  and  planetary science  communities, although applications to biological and industrial systems are beginning to emerge. [ 10 ]   The most abundant iron isotope  56 Fe is of particular interest to nuclear scientists. A common misconception is that this isotope represents the most stable nucleus possible, and that it thus would be impossible to perform fission or fusion on  56 Fe and still liberate energy. This is not true, as both  62 Ni and  58 Fe are more stable, being the most stable nuclei. However, since  56 Ni is much more easily produced from lighter nuclei in the  alpha process  in nuclear reactions in supernovae (see  silicon burning process ), nickel-56 (14 alpha particles) is the endpoint of fusion chains inside  extremely massive stars , since addition of another alpha would result in zinc-60, which requires a great deal more energy. This nickel-56, which has a half-life of about 6 days, is therefore made in quantity in these stars, but soon decays by two successive positron emissions within supernova decay products in the  supernova remnant  gas cloud, to first radioactive cobalt-56, and then stable iron-56. This last nuclide is therefore common in the universe, relative to other stable  metals  of approximately the same atomic weight.   In phases of the meteorites  Semarkona  and  Chervony Kut  a correlation between the concentration of  60 Ni , the  daughter product  of  60 Fe, and the abundance of the stable iron isotopes could be found which is evidence for the existence of  60 Fe at the time of formation of the solar system. Possibly the energy released by the decay of  60 Fe contributed, together with the energy released by decay of the radionuclide  26 Al , to the remelting and  differentiation  of  asteroids  after their formation 4.6 billion years ago. The abundance of  60 Ni  present in  extraterrestrial  material may also provide further insight into the origin of the  solar system  and its early history. Of the stable isotopes, only  57 Fe has a nuclear  spin  (1/2).     [ edit ]   Iron in organic synthesis   The use of iron metal filings in organic synthesis is mainly for the  reduction  of  nitro compounds . [ 11 ]  Additionally, iron has been used for  desulfurizations , [ 12 ]   reduction  of  aldehydes , [ 13 ]  and the  deoxygenation  of amine oxides. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Iron in biology          Structure of  Heme b       Main article:  Human iron metabolism   Iron is essential to nearly all known  organisms . In  cells , iron is generally stored in the centre of  metalloproteins , because ""free"" iron (which binds non-specifically to many cellular components) can catalyse production of toxic  free radicals .  Iron deficiency  can lead to  iron deficiency anemia .   In animals, plants, and fungi, iron is often the metal ion incorporated into the  heme  complex. Heme is an essential component of  cytochrome  proteins, which mediate  redox  reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as  hemoglobin ,  myoglobin , and  leghemoglobin . Inorganic iron also contributes to redox reactions in the  iron-sulfur clusters  of many  enzymes , such as  nitrogenase  (involved in the synthesis of  ammonia  from  nitrogen  and  hydrogen ) and  hydrogenase . Non-heme iron proteins include the  enzymes   methane monooxygenase  (oxidizes  methane  to  methanol ),  ribonucleotide reductase  (reduces  ribose  to  deoxyribose ;  DNA biosynthesis ),  hemerythrins  ( oxygen  transport and fixation in  marine invertebrates ) and purple acid phosphatase ( hydrolysis  of  phosphate   esters ).   Iron distribution is heavily regulated in  mammals , partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity. Iron distribution is also regulated because many bacteria require iron, so restricting its availability to bacteria (generally by  sequestering  it inside cells) can help to prevent or limit infections. This is probably the reason for the relatively low amounts of iron in mammalian milk. A major component of this regulation is the protein  transferrin , which binds iron absorbed from the  duodenum  and carries it in the  blood  to cells. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Nutrition and dietary sources   Good sources of dietary iron include  red meat ,  fish ,  poultry ,  lentils ,  beans ,  leaf vegetables ,  tofu ,  chickpeas ,  black-eyed peas , fortified bread, and fortified breakfast cereals. Iron in low amounts is found in  molasses ,  teff  and  farina . Iron in meat (haem iron) is more easily absorbed than iron in vegetables, [ 16 ]  but  heme / hemoglobin  from  red meat  has effects which may increase the likelihood of  colorectal cancer . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]   Iron provided by  dietary supplements  is often found as  iron (II) fumarate , although iron sulfate is cheaper and is absorbed equally well. Elemental iron, despite being absorbed to a much smaller extent (stomach acid is sufficient to convert some of it to ferrous iron), is often added to foods such as breakfast cereals or ""enriched"" wheat flour (where it is listed as ""reduced iron"" in the list of ingredients). Iron is most available to the body when  chelated  to amino acids - iron in this form is ten to fifteen times more bioavailable [ 19 ]  than any other, and is also available for use as a common  iron supplement . Often the amino acid chosen for this purpose is the cheapest and most common amino acid, glycine, leading to ""iron glycinate"" supplements. [ 20 ]  The  RDA  for iron varies considerably based on age, gender, and source of dietary iron ( heme -based iron has higher  bioavailability ). [ 21 ]  Infants may require iron supplements if they are breast-fed. [ 22 ]   Blood donors  and pregnant women are at special risk of low iron levels and are often advised to supplement their iron intake. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Regulation of iron uptake   Excessive iron can be toxic, because free ferrous iron reacts with  peroxides  to produce  free radicals , which are highly reactive and can damage  DNA ,  proteins ,  lipids , and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when there is free iron in the cell, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of  transferrin  to bind the iron.   Iron uptake  is tightly regulated by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is mostly by regulating uptake. [ 23 ]  However, large amounts of ingested iron can cause excessive levels of iron in the blood because high iron levels can damage the cells of the  gastrointestinal tract , preventing them from regulating iron absorption, high blood concentrations of iron damage cells in the  heart ,  liver  and elsewhere, which can cause serious problems, including long-term organ damage and even death.   Humans experience iron toxicity above 20 milligrams of iron for every  kilogram  of mass, and 60 milligrams per kilogram is a  lethal dose . [ 24 ]  Over-consumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of  ferrous sulfate  tablets intended for adult consumption, is one of the most common toxicological causes of death in children under six. [ 24 ]  The  DRI  lists the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults as 45  mg /day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40 mg/day.   Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people as a result of a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in  iron overload disorders , such as  hemochromatosis . Many people have a genetic susceptibility to iron overload without realizing it or being aware of a family history of the problem. For this reason, it is advised that people do not take iron supplements unless they suffer from  iron deficiency  and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to cause disease in between 0.3 and 0.8% of Caucasians. [ 25 ]   The medical management of iron toxicity is complex, and can include use of a specific  chelating  agent called  deferoxamine  to bind and expel excess iron from the body.
