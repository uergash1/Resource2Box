This represents an increase of $4.8 billion, or 49 percent, since 1994-95. For the 2002-03 school year, the calculation of State aid has been simplified by creation of a new Comprehensive Operating Aid formula which will replace four previously existing categories of aid. Increased funding will be available for programs that serve at-risk pupils, as well as for programs that assist schools in meeting the State's higher learning standards. Continued funding is available for early childhood education and for class size reduction initiatives. In addition, changes are enacted for State aid for certain school construction projects. The 2002-03 State budget also includes a cost of living adjustment for STAR senior income eligibility effective with the 2003-04 school year. Major elements of State support for elementary and secondary education for the 2002-03 school year include the following:  An overall increase of $410.79 million (2.89 percent) in school aid, including an increase of $420.02 million (3.09 percent) in formula-based computerized aids.1 A $59.44 million increase to 445 below-average wealth school districts through the new Comprehensive Operating Aid formula. A $41.70 million, or 6.16 percent, increase in Extraordinary Needs Aid to provide funding to districts with concentrations of at-risk pupils. An increase of $74.63 million, or 54.24 percent, in Operating Standards Aid to support services and expenses        1  The 2002-03 enacted computerized aid total for school districts is based upon formula aid calculations. For the most part, this was not the case for the previous school year. In August 2001, the Legislature adopted a baseline budget for the 2001-02 school year. The baseline budget provided a statewide total for computerized aid of $12,076.82 million. Rather than a formuladerived total, each school district received an amount equal to the district total set forth in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget.  1   related to achieving the State's higher learning standards.  A new $24.92 million Academic Support Aid to provide funding to improve academic performance in the State's Big Five City school districts. An additional $5.78 million, for a total of $43.20 million, to assist school districts in operating summer programs and to provide courses to improve student performance in required academic subjects or to prepare for Regents examinations. Building Aid will be funded at $1,234.90 million including nearly $140 million in Capital Outlay Transition grants. This total funding level reflects implementation of reforms enacted in Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001 whereby the State will reimburse its share of school construction projects over the useful life of the project. Funding of $2,247.51 million is available to provide public and private excess cost aid for programs for pupils with disabilities. To promote education of disabled children with their non-disabled peers, a pupil weighting of 0.5 will be added to the existing public excess cost aid weighting for severely disabled children to generate additional aid for those children who require special education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive these services in a general education setting. Continued funding is provided for Universal Prekindergarten Aid ($204.68 million), for Class Size Reduction programs ($139.97 million), and for Minor Maintenance Aid ($49.97 million). An increase of $11.30 million is allocated for Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive Aid to provide funding for 2002-03 programs as well as to aid districts that first offered full-day kindergarten programs in the 2001-02 school year, but which did not receive funding in the 2001-02 State budget. An increase of $79.03 million is provided for expensebased Transportation Aid. Statewide, up to $5 million continues to be available for reimbursement of summer school transportation expenses.            2     For the 2002-03 school year, aid for BOCES services, based on 2001-02 school district expenditures, will total $510.91 million. Eligibility for Special Services Aid has been expanded. For the 2002-03 school year, $128.39 million will be provided both to the Big Five City school districts and to other districts that are non-components of BOCES. The 2002-03 State budget authorizes the Municipal Bond Bank Agency to issue bonds to accelerate payment of prior year aid claims to school districts. The Big Five City school districts and other districts with over $1 million in such claims are eligible for financing to accelerate nearly $470 million in prior year claim payments. For the 2002-03 school year, the Charter School Stimulus fund will continue to provide $6 million to support charter school start-up efforts throughout the State including $2.15 million for the SUNY Charter School Institute which provides technical assistance for charter schools. STAR property tax relief will increase by $100 million, from $1.99 billion in 2001-02 to an estimated $2.09 billion in 2002-03, to support the $50,000 full value exemption for income-eligible seniors and the $30,000 full value exemption for other homeowners. A key component of the 2002-03 budget for the STAR program is a cost of living adjustment (COLA) for senior income eligibility. Effective with applications for the 2003-04 school year, the COLA will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income will not make seniors who receive enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. In addition, legislation was enacted which provides seniors with the option of having their income eligibility for the enhanced STAR benefit verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Seniors who elect the income verification option as part of their application for the 2003-04 school year will not have to reapply for the exemption in the following years. They will be automatically renewed as long as their income eligibility and homeowner status remain unchanged.          3   2002-03 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS A summary of the 2002-03 school aid and STAR programs contained in Chapter 83 of the Laws of 2002, as well as related programs contained primarily in the Education, Labor and Family Assistance Budget (Chapter 53) of the Laws of 2002 is presented in this publication. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will increase the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools (GSPS), BOCES Aid and Employment Preparation Education (EPE) Aid by $410.79 million, from $14,191.30 million in 2001-02 to $14,602.09 million in the 2002-03 school year, an increase of 2.89 percent. Formula-based computerized aids will increase by $420.02 million or 3.09 percent. Significant items for 2002-03 include:  A new simplified Comprehensive Operating Aid will replace four previous aids (Operating Aid, Tax Effort and Tax Equalization Aid and the Transition Adjustment calculation). Comprehensive Operating Aid will provide $6,869.92 million to the 680 public school districts statewide including $59.44 million in increases to the State's 445 below-average wealth school districts. Operating Standards Aid is enriched to provide $212.21 million, an increase of $74.63 million. This aid supports school districts in providing programs and services to help students meet the learning standards established by the Board of Regents. A new Academic Support Aid will provide $24.92 million to improve student performance on the learning standards in the State's Big Five City school districts. New York City will receive $12.82 million, or 51 percent, of the statewide total for this aid category. The Extraordinary Needs Aid formula will provide $718.75 million in funding, a $41.70 million increase, to districts with concentrations of pupils with extraordinary needs. Funding of $2,247.51 million is available to provide excess cost aid for public and private programs for pupils with disabilities. A public excess cost pupil weighting of 0.5 will generate aid for those children who require special          4   education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive these services in a general education setting. Additional formula adjustments include a pupil weighting change for those pupils receiving special services or programs 60 percent or more of the school day and an adjustment to the save-harmless calculation.  As a result of Building Aid payment changes enacted by the legislature in October 2001 (Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001), the State will begin reimbursing school districts for the State share of the cost of building projects over the useful life of the projects. For the 2002-03 school year, $1,234.90 million will be paid to school districts in continuing support of approved school construction projects statewide. These payments include $140 million in 2002-03 Capital Outlay Transition Grants which provide continued payment to school districts for ""hard dollar"" expenditures as the State aligns the payment of Building Aid for all projects with assumed amortization requirements. For the 2002-03 school year, aid for BOCES services will be $510.91 million, an increase of $55.64 million or 12.22 percent. Districts will receive aid based on 2001-02 school year expenditures. For the 2002-03 school year Special Services Aid will total $128.39 million. Eligibility for Special Services Aid has been expanded to include not only the Big Five City school districts, but all other school districts which are not components of a BOCES. An increase of $79.03 million is provided for expense-based Transportation Aid. This amount will fully fund all projected school district increases for aidable transportation expenditures. A total of $263.05 million, an increase of $4.53 million or 1.75 percent, is provided for the textbook, software and hardware aid categories. Computer Software Aid is increased by $0.49 million or 1.09 percent. Textbook Aid is increased by $3.94 million or 2.12 percent. Computer Hardware Aid is increased by $0.10 million or 0.36 percent.          5     LADDER  A total of $204.68 million is continued for Prekindergarten Aid, which is reflective of recent school district expenditures for this program. This total amount will be provided through a combination of State funding and Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. Class Size Reduction is funded at $139.97 million. This represents continuation of the previous funding level for this program. School districts offering full-day kindergarten programs will receive $16.18 million for 2002-03, an $11.30 million increase. In addition to providing funds for new 2002-03 programs, funding is included for those districts which first implemented full-day kindergarten programs in 2001-02, but did not receive aid under the enacted 2001-02 State budget. For 2002-03, Minor Maintenance is funded at $49.97 million. New York City will receive $33.33 million of the statewide total.          Continued General Support for Public School funding is provided for various categorical aid programs including: Teacher Support Aid ($67.48 million), Teacher Centers ($30 million) and the Teacher-Mentor Intern program ($5 million). Chapter 53 of the Laws of 2002 also includes additional funding of $1 million outside of General Support for Public Schools for each of the latter two programs. The ""Teachers of Tomorrow"" initiative will be continued at $25.00 million. The program provides assistance to school districts, including the Big Five City schools, in their efforts to increase the supply of qualified entry-level teachers. Small Cities Aid ($81.88 million) and Bilingual Grants ($11.20 million) will be continued at 2001-02 funding levels. The 2002-03 State Budget provides funding of $57 million for payment of statewide prior year claims and/or fiscal stabilization grants including $33 million for payment to        6   New York City. In addition, the 2002-03 State budget authorizes the Municipal Bond Bank Agency (MBBA) to issue bonds to accelerate payment of prior year aid claims. Eligible school districts include the Big Five City school districts and other school districts with more than $1 million in such claims. MBBA financing will permit acceleration of prior year claim payments of nearly $470 million including $435 million for New York City.  FORMULA-BASED AIDS Comprehensive Operating Aid: In 2001-02 there was no separate Operating Aid, Tax Effort Aid, Tax Equalization Aid or Transition Adjustment calculation as these aids were incorporated within the baseline school aid amount enacted by the Legislature. For 2002-03 a single Comprehensive Operating Aid will replace these previous aids.2 Each district will receive Comprehensive Operating Aid equal to a calculation based on the 2001-02 Executive Budget Flex Aid amount set forth in the January 2001 computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" minus the 2000-01 aids listed below:         Gifted and Talented Aid Minor Maintenance Aid Public Excess Cost Aid Private Excess Cost Aid Educationally Related Support Services Aid Extraordinary Needs Aid Operating Standards Aid Limited English Proficiency Aid  Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio of less than 1.000 will receive a one percent increase in Comprehensive Operating Aid. Statewide, 445 districts will receive aid increases totaling $59.44 million. (New York City will receive $24.34 million, or 41 percent, of this amount.) For the 2002-03 school year, this aid will total $6,869.92 million. Operating Standards Aid: For 2002-03, $212.21 million, an increase of $74.63 million, will be available for services and 2  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid (as cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used.  7   expenses related to achieving the Board of Regents' high learning standards. The aid per pupil amount has been increased from $7.50 to $8.50. Increased funding is available for school districts with a high percentage of at-risk pupils. Additional aid will also be provided to school districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio less than .700. A save-harmless provision guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2000-01. Academic Support Aid: A total of $24.92 million for academic improvement is provided to Big Five City school districts through this new aid category. These funds will be allocated as follows:      New York City Yonkers Syracuse Buffalo Rochester $12,820,000 5,700,000 2,280,000 2,100,000 2,020,000  Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of limited English proficient and other at-risk pupils. Several formula enhancements first enacted in 1998-99 are continued, including a recalculation of the concentration and sparsity factors. The save-harmless provision guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2000-01. Extraordinary Needs Aid will provide $718.75 million to school districts, an increase of $41.70 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula, which supports school district programs for special needs students, continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the formula Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum. The second uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the Extraordinary Needs percent in excess of 60 percent and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The aid ceiling for the first per-pupil calculation is $365.00; that for the second is $635.00. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 9 percent; that for the second is 15 percent. For 2002-03, this aid will total $73.54 million, an increase of $3.46 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: This program supports the commitment to a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for pupils with disabilities. For aids payable  8   in 2002-03, the calculation of Public Excess Cost Aid will be based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 2000-01 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $7,400. The aid ratio will be determined using the Combined Wealth Ratio and based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. For 2002-03, the public excess cost pupil weightings contain a 0.5 weighting for those children who required special education services in the year prior to the base year at least 60 percent of the time and who received these services in a general education setting. The pupil weighting for students served in segregated settings in the base year will be 1.68 for aid paid in 2002-03. The save-harmless provision is revised to ensure that no district will receive less than 95 percent of the amount paid for 2001-02. Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for Public Excess Cost Aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid equals 50 percent of a district's Public Excess Cost Aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Public Excess Cost Aid will total $2,074.78 million in 2002-03, an increase of $221.73 million. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs serving public school children placed in private school settings and in the State-operated schools in Rome and Batavia. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 2002-03 will total $172.73 million, an increase of $26.89 million. BOCES Aid: For 2002-03, aid to reimburse districts for expenditures for BOCES services in the 2001-02 school year will total $510.91 million, an increase of $55.64 million. Beginning with contracts entered into on or after January 15, 2000, school districts are not eligible for BOCES Aid for the purchase or installation of educational technology unless a district can demonstrate that this shared service is costeffective without regard to the availability of State aid. For the 2002-03 school year, the use of BOCES in the provision of Academic Intervention Services (AIS) to improve student  9   performance must continue to be approved by the State Education Department to be aid eligible. As is the case with the technology cost-effectiveness requirement, districts must demonstrate, not only that district resources were insufficient to provide appropriate Academic Intervention Services, but that accessing BOCES services is a cost-effective solution. Special Services Aid: For 2002-03, eligibility for Special Services Aid for career education and computer services has been expanded to include all school districts which are not components of a BOCES. This aid, which totals $128.39 million for 2002-03, a decrease of $3.12 million, was previously provided only to the Big Five City school districts. Since these five districts are not permitted to join BOCES, a different formula (now applicable to all non-component districts) is used to fund career education programs and computer services provided by such districts. The career education aid ceiling for 2002-03 is continued at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. Transportation Aid: For 2002-03, the minimum aid ratio for Transportation Aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, this aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved transportation expenses). Transportation Aid will total $1,017.67 million in 2002-03, an increase of $79.03 million. The aid ratio choice permitting school districts to receive aid based on public and non-public enrollments is continued and will benefit districts transporting large numbers of nonpublic school students. District expenditures for transportation to and from school district operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5 million statewide. Districts may claim aid based on the transportation of pupils in summer school courses to improve performance during the summer of 2001. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year. Limited English Proficiency: For 2002-03, the LEP per pupil calculation based on formula Operating Aid has been restored. As a result, school district programs for the education of  10   students with limited proficiency in English will be supported by $68.60 million, a decrease of $1.41 million. Gifted and Talented: For 2002-03, $15.35 million, an increase of $0.97 million is available to fund programs for gifted students. Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid: Reorganization Incentive Aid is provided for operating expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law. It is paid as a supplement based on formula Operating Aid when districts meet certain conditions prescribed by law. Beginning in 1992, reorganization incentive operating aid for reorganizing districts was increased to 40 percent for the first five years. The statutory provisions for reorganization incentive operating aid remain unchanged. In total Reorganization Incentive Operating Aid will amount to $19.25 million in 2002-03, a decrease of $2.06 million. Textbook and Computer Aids: For the 2002-03 school year, the following provisions apply:  Textbook Aid: These funds reimburse school districts for the purchase and loan of textbooks. Textbooks are loaned to both public and nonpublic pupils. The lottery funded portion of Textbook Aid is $15.00 per pupil. The general fund portion will be $42.30 per pupil, for a combined maximum textbook aid payment of $57.30 per pupil. Schools are also able to qualify for reimbursement based on eligible purchases of content-based instructional materials in an electronic format. This aid will total $189.89 million in 2002-03, an increase of $3.94 million. Computer Software Aid: Under this program, aid is apportioned to districts for the purchase and loan of computer software. Software programs designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils pursuant to Rules of the Board of Regents. For the 2002-03 school year, districts will be reimbursed for expenses up to $14.98 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2002-03, Computer Software Aid will total $45.43 million, an increase of $0.49 million. Instructional Computer Hardware and Technology Equipment Aid: This aid category provides funding for the lease or purchase of mini- and microcomputers, computer terminals 11       or technology equipment for instructional purposes and repair and staff development. Computer Hardware Aid equals approved expense (up to $19.25 per pupil, adjusted by the current year AV/RWADA aid ratio). For the 2002-03 school year, $27.73 million, an increase of $0.10 million, is provided. Library Materials Aid: Districts are reimbursed for expenses up to $6.00 per pupil based on public and nonpublic school enrollment. For 2002-03, Library Materials Aid will total $19.38 million, an increase of $0.39 million. Materials purchased under this program and designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils. Prekindergarten: Beginning in 1998-99, State funds were provided to expand the availability of prekindergarten programs for four-year-old children statewide. For 2002-03, a total of $204.68 million is continued for State prekindergarten grants. This total amount will be provided through a combination of State funding and Federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds. Early Grade Class Size Reduction Aid: For 2002-03, $139.97 million is continued to enable school districts to reduce class size in kindergarten and in grades one through three. Full-Day K Incentive Aid: This aid category provides funding to encourage school districts to establish full-day kindergarten programs intended to strengthen the quality of education for five-year-old children. School districts first offering full-day kindergarten programs in 2002-03 will receive current year formula Operating Aid for any increase in the number of students served in full-day programs in 2002-03 compared to 2001-02. In addition, those districts that first offered programs in the 2001-02 school year, but did not receive aid in the enacted 2001-02 State budget for the increased number of students served in full day programs in 2001-02 compared to 2000-01, will receive that aid in 2002-03. For 2002-03, a total of $16.18 million, an increase of $11.30 million, is provided for this program. Minor Maintenance Aid: For 2002-03, $49.97 million will be reinstituted for support of minor maintenance projects necessary to preserve school facilities statewide. School districts will receive funding based upon the average age of their facilities and upon enrollment growth.  12   Tax Limitation Aid: For 2002-03, a total of $25.00 million is provided to school districts through this formula aid calculated using district tax levy from residential property and overall district income. Summer School Aid: In 2000-01, a new summer school program was established to fund school district courses to improve student performance in required academic subjects or in taking Regents examinations. For 2002-03, this aid will total $43.20 million, an increase of $5.78 million. School districts that provided transportation for pupils to district operated summer school programs for the 2001 summer school session may claim Transportation Aid for such services in the 2002-03 school year. Such aid will be capped at a statewide total of $5.00 million. While BOCES may operate summer session programs on a shared services basis, BOCES may not claim aid for summer programs under this new aid category. Building/Reorganization Incentive Building Aid: For 2002-03 Building Aid to support school building projects throughout the State (including Reorganization Incentive Aid for building expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law) will total $1,234.90 million. The 10 percent Building Aid enrichment provided for projects approved July 1, 1998 and thereafter is continued in 2002-03. Projects approved by voters beginning July 1, 2000 receive Building Aid based on the greater of their current year AV/RWADA aid ratio or their 1999-00 Building Aid ratio reduced by 10 percentage points. Reforms included in Chapter 383 of the Laws of 2001 provide that, beginning July 1, 2002, the State share of all bonded projects, both existing and future, will be paid to school districts on the basis of assumed amortization. The reimbursement period will be tied to the useful life of the project. The 2002-03 State Budget conforms the payment of State aid for hard dollar projects with the recently enacted reforms for bonded projects. A total of $140 million in Capital Outlay Transition Grants is made available to school districts to aid in the transition from the previous reimbursement system for hard dollar projects to one based on assumed amortization. Beginning with Building Aid payable in the 2003-04 school year for school district expenditures made during the 2002-03 school year, aid for hard dollar expenditures will be calculated  13   based on the useful life of the project (15 years for reconstruction, 20 years for major construction/additions and 30 years for new buildings). Teacher Support Aid: For the 2002-03 school year, $67.48 million will be available for this Big Five City school district program. Growth Aid: Growth Aid to qualifying districts will be paid as a separate apportionment in June 2003. As provided for in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996, a district's growth index is calculated based on the change in enrollment rather than the change in average daily attendance. For 2002-03, Growth aid will total $30.20 million, an increase of $18.39 million. GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER AID CATEGORIES Teachers of Tomorrow: For 2002-03, $25 million will continue to be available for incentives such as awards and stipends to retain and attract teachers into New York's classrooms, particularly in areas where teacher shortages exist. Of available funds, $15 million, or 60 percent, will go to New York City. Teacher Resource and Computer Training Centers: General Support for Public School funding of $30.00 million is available for this program in the 2002-03 school year.

Senior homeowners at least 65 years old and with incomes up to $60,000 are eligible to receive exemptions of at least $50,000 from the full value of their primary residences for school tax purposes. The property tax component of the STAR program will also provide other homeowners with at least a $30,000 exemption from the full value of their primary residence for school property tax purposes. In those counties where the median value of homes exceeds the statewide median home value, as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS), the value of the exemptions will be increased. The State will reimburse school districts dollar-for-dollar for the property tax revenues foregone from these exemptions. School District Reimbursement for STAR STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies to the Commissioner of Education amounts payable under the STAR program and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements in the 2002-03 school year will follow the same accelerated formula as last year. Under the accelerated schedule, 35% of a district's school tax relief aid reimbursement will be paid in October and an additional 35% in November. Ten percent will be paid in December and the balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003. 2002-2003 Budget Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) for Senior Income Eligibility: A cost of living adjustment (COLA) will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income  24   will not make seniors who receive Enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. Effective for applications filed in 2003 and later, the $60,000 income limit will be increased annually in proportion to increases in the Consumer Price Index. Senior Income Verification: The Budget includes legislation which establishes a STAR income verification program for seniors applying for the enhanced exemption. With their 2003-04 application, seniors will have the option of allowing their income eligibility in future years to be verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Once they have chosen this option, seniors will no longer be required to reapply in subsequent years. Third Party Notice: School districts will no longer be responsible for administering third party notification for senior STAR recipients. As enacted in Chapter 83 of the Laws of 2002, effective for 2003 STAR applications, local assessors will take over the responsibility of sending renewal notices to designated third parties.  25   OTHER INITIATIVES Chapters 53 and 83 of the Laws of 2002, as well as other enacted 2002 legislation, include educational programs and initiatives regarding mandate relief measures, school personnel, extended day child education and teacher quality. Mandate Relief: Currently, school districts statewide must allocate staff time and resources to the completion of over 50 plans and reports imposed on the districts by the State Education Department (SED). In an effort to reduce this reporting burden, the enacted 2002-03 State budget directs the Commissioner of Education to review all of the plans and reports now required to be completed by school districts. On or before June 1, 2003, the Commissioner must report to the Director of the Budget and to the Legislature on SED's efforts to determine if there is a need for continued annual submission of such reports and on its efforts to reduce excess reporting requirements. Early Retirement: To help reduce local costs, Chapter 69 of the laws of 2002 provides two early retirement incentive programs for school district and other public employees. School districts may chose to ""opt in"" to the first, standard retirement incentive program, which allows for the accumulation of one month of additional service credit for each year of employment up to 36 months. An additional, one-time program, will enable anyone aged 55 with 25 years of service to retire without penalty. Advantage Schools: The Advantage Schools initiative continues to provide a secure and enriching environment for children during those hours after school ends but before many parents are home from work. At over 160 sites statewide, children from kindergarten through 12th grade have opportunities for enriching experiences that complement their education in a safe, supportive program operating in neighborhood schools. The State Budget appropriates $25.00 million, an increase of $5.00 million, to the Office of Children and Family Services for Advantage Schools in 2002-03. New York City School Reform: Chapter 91 of the Laws of 2002 amends the Education Law to give the Mayor of New York City new powers and greater control over City schools, including the power to appoint the New York City Schools Chancellor. The Chancellor will serve at the pleasure of the Mayor and will head a thirteen-member board  expanded from the previous seven-  26   member board - which will advise the Chancellor on matters of policy. The new law provides the Chancellor with the power to appoint community school district superintendents. The law gives the Mayor sole control of the School Construction Authority (SCA) by authorizing him to appoint two members of the board, with the Chancellor serving as the third member. Effective June 30, 2003, the law also repeals statutory provisions that originally established the existing thirty-two community school boards. A task force will be established to discuss possible models to replace the community school boards, and will submit its recommendations to the Governor and Legislature by February 15, 2003. Finally, the legislation includes a maintenance of effort provision which requires New York City to maintain its spending on its schools at least in the same amount as was provided in the preceding year. The City may only reduce its contribution to schools if overall City revenues decline. Roosevelt School District: In response to identified administrative and financial deficiencies in the Roosevelt School District, legislation was enacted in 2002 authorizing the Commissioner of Education to remove the Board of Education and replace it with an interim board. This interim board, under the oversight of the Commissioner, is charged with implementing a corrective action plan to improve both fiscal and academic performance in the district. This board will gradually transition to a locally elected board starting in 2007. In order to alleviate the financial problems faced by the district, the legislation also provided up to $6 million annually in special academic improvement grants to the Roosevelt School District, extended the payment of the existing $4 million State aid advance, authorized the issuance of bonds to address deficits in the district's general fund balance, and provided enhanced State assistance for construction of any new buildings deemed necessary. Stabilization Grants: In addition to the State aid formula amounts calculated for school districts, the May 2002 computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" and provided by the State Education Department in support of the 2002-03 enacted State budget includes $7.76 million in Stabilization Grant funds to 56 nonBig Five City school districts statewide.  27   SUMMARY OF 2002-03 SCHOOL YEAR/FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATIONS School Year/Fiscal Year Impact There are two time frames to consider when discussing 200203 New York State aid programs relating to support for public schools: the 2002-03 school year which runs from July 1, 2002 through June 30, 2003; and the 2002-03 State fiscal year which runs from April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003.

Each of the appendices is described below.  Appendix III-A summarizes the School Aid categories and adjustments enacted for 2002-03 and compares them with the 2001-02 aid categories. Appendix III-B provides the mathematical formulas for computing 25 different aids for 2002-03 school aid payments. Appendix III-C describes the pupil counts used in aid formulas. Appendix III-D describes the payment schedule for aids payable under section 3609 of the Education Law in the 2002-03 school year.       36   APPENDIX III-A COMPARISON OF 2001-02 AND 2002-03 GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROGRAMS Category COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING AID 2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Operating Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget. 2002-03 School Year No district will receive less that the Flex Aid amount allocated for each district in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget minus the 2000-01 school year amounts payable for Extraordinary Needs Aid, Minor Maintenance Aid, Public and Private Excess Cost Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid and Operating Standards Aid. Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio3 less than 1.000 will receive an additional one percent in Comprehensive Operating Aid. GROWTH AID4 A district's apportionment for 200102 Growth Aid was based on data on file with the commissioner of education for preparation of the 200102 Executive Budget Growth Index in excess of 1.004 * Formula Operating Aid5  3  A district's Combined Wealth Ratio for 2002-03 is equal to: (.5 x District Pupil Wealth Ratio) + (.5 x District Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio). The district Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: (1999 Actual Valuation)/2000-01 TWPU $264,200 ; and the Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio is equal to: 1999 District Income/2000-01 TWPU $110,100 Beginning with the 1997-98 school year, income and actual valuation data moved back one year from the previous year-prior-to-the-base-year data. The Actual Valuation (AV) for calculating a district's property wealth per pupil for 1997-98 was 1994 AV. The income wealth per pupil calculation used the 1994 Adjusted Gross Income of district residents. For the 2002-03 school year, 1999 Actual Valuation and Adjusted Gross Income will be used. 4  For the 1997-98 school year and after the Growth Index is defined as a measure of enrollment rather than attendance.  37   Category EXTRAORDINARY NEEDS AID Formula Ceiling  2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Extraordinary Needs Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.  2002-03 School Year A minimum of 11% of the Formula Operating Aid ceiling. If more than 74.5% of a district's enrolled students have extraordinary needs, the district receives more than 11% of its Formula Operating Aid ceiling. The calculation for Formula Operating Aid is described in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law. Alternate Pupil Wealth Ratio .60 100% of 2000-01 aid The sum of the percentage of eligible K-6 free and reduced price lunch applicants times 2001 enrollment, plus the number of Limited English Proficiency Students, plus a sparsity factor based on a calculation of enrollment per square mile times 2001 enrollment.  Wealth Measure State Share Save-Harmless Pupil Count  URBAN-SUBURBAN TRANSFER SUPPLEMENTATION  If formula operating aid per pupil is greater in the district of residence, the district of attendance will receive urban-suburban transfer aid equal to formula operating aid per pupil that the district of residence would have received.  Qualifying districts will receive the same aid that they would have received in the 2000-01 school year.  5  Where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Growth Aid, Formula Operating Aid (as cited in subdivision 13 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used.  38   Category GIFTED AND TALENTED AID Pupil Count Ceiling  2001-02 School Year None Funding in lieu of 200102 Gifted and Talented Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.  2002-03 School Year  3% of ADA $196  LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AID Weighting  None Funding in lieu of 200102 Limited English Proficiency Aid was provided in the $12,076.82 million amount set forth for school districts in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT0321"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget and which was included by the Legislature in the enacted budget.

Starting with all new building projects approved by the voters beginning July 1, 2000, the selected building aid ratio is based upon the greater of a school district's current-year building aid ratio or the aid ratio selected for use in 1999-00 reduced by 10 percentage points. School districts with a pupil wealth ratio greater than 2.50 and an alternate pupil wealth ratio less than .850 may select an aid ratio equal to 1.263 multiplied by the district's Formula Operating Aid Ratio. Incentive: For aid payable in 1998-99 and after for new projects approved by the voters after 7/1/98 districts will continue to receive an additional 10 percent State reimbursement. However, the sum of the incentive and the selected aid ratio may Not exceed .950.

Section 3609-a includes computerized aids payable as General Support for Public Schools (GSPS) except for aids which are covered under the Section 3609-b (Excess Cost) payment schedule and Section 3609-d (BOCES Aid) payments as well as Textbook, Software and Library Materials aids. Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will not be paid until June 2003. Building Aid will be paid based on an assumed amortization for the 2002-03 aid year. Small Cities Aid is covered by Section 3609-c. In addition Section 3609-e of the Education Law governs the schedule of school district payments for School Tax Relief (STAR). This payment is intended to reimburse school districts for school property tax exemptions granted pursuant to Section 425 of the Real Property Tax Law. For GSPS aid payable in the 2002-03 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003. The payment schedule has several features: GSPS Aids   Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on or before September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November. AFixed@ payments will be paid in the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's apportionments, after TRS payments, will be paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent by October 15, 18.75 percent by November 15 and 25.00 percent by December 15. AIndividualized@ payments will be calculated for the months of January through June. January through May payments are based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. The June payment is based on data available to the Commissioner as of May 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 2003. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31.      66     Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year will be paid to school districts on or before March 31 on a prorata basis using the district=s relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total monies designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the total monies designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies designated for March (if a negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General Support of Public Schools will be used. Any aid payable for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. Building Aid will be paid based on an assumed amortization for the 2002-03 aid year. In addition the total of such aid payable through June for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid cannot exceed the total of such aid as it appears on the computer listing ""SA020-3."" Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003.      STAR Aid  STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies to the Commissioner of Education amounts payable under the STAR program and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements in the 2002-03 school year will follow the same accelerated formula as last year. Under the accelerated schedule, 35% of a district's school tax relief aid reimbursement will be paid in October and an additional 35% in November. Ten percent will be paid in December and the balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003. Payment amounts will be based on current data on file at the time of each payment through January. Current statutory provisions authorizing the Commissioner to withhold State aid payments from school districts that have not submitted enrollment and expenditure data on a timely basis shall not apply to STAR aid payments. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that occur after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2003.         67   Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Reimbursement). Such State share monies will be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid Reimbursement. Any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids will be paid in accordance with the schedule below. Total Excess Cost Aids payable to a district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget.  The positive remainder of 25 percent of Excess Cost Aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November, 2002 will be paid on or before December 15. The positive remainder of 70 percent of such aids minus any apportionment previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-February 2003 will be paid on or before March 15. The positive remainder of 85 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-May 2003 will be paid on or before June 15. The positive remainder of 100 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 2002-July 2003 will be paid on or before August 15. Any excess of actual Excess Cost Aids payable over the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2003.          BOCES Aid  BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school districts of the BOCES, but the sum of all such payments are paid directly to the BOCES. Total BOCES Aid payable for the school year to each component school district may not exceed 100 percent of the amount of such aid as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" which was released in May 2002 with issuance of the 2002-03 Budget plus any BOCES Aid payable to contracting school districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts based on data on file at the time of each payment. BOCES obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will be paid by the State on behalf of the BOCES from the apportionment payable to the BOCES by the fifteenth of each of the months of September, October and November. An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on or before February 1 equal to 25 percent of the lesser of the actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" plus BOCES Aid payable for contracting school st      68   districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts, minus the payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf.  An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on the first business day of June equal to 55 percent of the lesser of the actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component school district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA020-3"" plus BOCES Aid payable for contracting school districts, less-than-eight teacher districts and Special Act school districts, minus the sum of all previous payments including payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf.

This unprecedented growth in State support to public schools includes the following components: C A $650 million school year. and secondary million. This State history. increase in computerized aids for the 1997-98 The total increase for all elementary, middle education programs is approximately $750 represents the largest funding increase in  C  A new STAR initiative that will provide homeowners across the State approximately $2.2 billion in direct property tax relief when fully implemented in 2001-02. A multi-year education investment that beginning in 1998-99 will support pre-kindergarten program expansion, full-day kindergarten incentive funding and a class size reduction initiative. In addition, school districts will be eligible in 1998-99 for enriched building aid support for new projects and minor maintenance aid. 1997-98 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS  C  A summary of the 1997-98 school aid programs contained in Chapter 436 of the Laws of 1997, as well as related programs contained in the Education, Labor and Social Services Budget (Chapter 53) of the Laws of 1997 and Chapter 389(STAR)are presented in this bulletin. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will increase the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools, BOCES Aid and Employment Preparation Education Aid by $679.31 million, from $10,271.89 million in 1996-97 to $10,951.20 million in the 199798 school year, an increase of 6.61 percent. Computerized aids will increase by $650.21 million or 6.71 percent. This is the largest enacted increase in State aid to public schools in history. The following major actions were taken: C Increased funding in the amount of $230.61 million is provided 1   for major operating aid programs subject to the transition adjustment to respond to growth in enrollment and increases in educational operating expenses. Of this amount, $91.18 million, or more than 39 percent will go to New York City. For 1997-98, no district will receive less than the previous year's sum of the aids subject to the transition adjustment. The transition adjustment will also allow districts to receive an increase in the sum of these aids over 1996-97 levels of up to 4.50 percent; or 17.60 percent of the amount withheld by the transition adjustment, whichever is greater. C An additional $16.39 million in State funding is available for textbooks and computer aids to be used to purchase new textbooks and to enhance the State's efforts to make computers accessible to students in every classroom. The General Fund portion of the Textbook Aid ceiling is increased to $25.00 for a total ceiling amount of $40.00. The Computer Software Aid ceiling is now $4.58 and that for Hardware Aid is $10.61. In the 1998-99 school year and after, these aids will also receive funding increases as a result of the multi-year STAR initiative highlighted below. Increased funding is provided to support services to students with special needs in regular classrooms. Additional State funding of $8.1 million is available for Educationally-Related Support Services Aid (ERSSA) and the declassification component of Public Excess Cost Aid is increased by $6 million to facilitate the transition of special needs students into regular classroom environments. Expense-based changes in building and transportation aids are provided under the same formulas used in 1996-97. Beginning in the 1998-99 school year the building aid formula will be enhanced to increase State support for school building projects and to recognize regional cost differences. Overall, for 1997-98 an additional $174.2 million is provided for building and transportation aids. The BOCES Aid limitation holding State support to 98 percent of present law has been eliminated. As a result, school districts will receive a $42.97 million BOCES Aid increase in 1997-98. $40 million is now available for prior year school aid claims, an increase of $18.2 million. $400,000 is now available for grants to school districts for school bus safety training purposes. 2  C  C  C  C C   COMPUTERIZED AIDS Major Operating Aids: As noted above, total State funding will be adjusted through a transition adjustment to ensure that no district receives less than its 1996-97 level for the major aids listed below. The transition adjustment will also allow districts to receive an increase in the sum of these aids over 1996-97 levels of up to 4.50 percent or 17.60 percent of the amount withheld by the transition adjustment, whichever is greater. Aids subject to the transition adjustment include:      Operating Aid Tax Effort Aid Tax Equalization Aid Gifted and Talented Aid Limited English Proficiency Aid  For the 1997-98 school year, aid provided to school districts under these programs totals $5,906.04 million, an increase of $230.61 million. Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of at-risk pupils. A recalculation of the formula's concentration factor will provide $544.52 million to school districts, an increase of $84.46 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula which supports school district programs for special needs students continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the selected Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum. The second uses the aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the extraordinary needs percent in excess of 60 percent and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The aid ceiling for the first per-pupil calculation continues to be $331.52; that for the second has been increased to $450.00. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 8 percent; that for the second has been increased to 12 percent (from 7 percent). For 1997-98, this aid will total $48.33 million, an increase of $8.13 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: This program supports the commitment to a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for pupils with disabilities. For aids payable in 199798, the calculation of public excess cost aid will be based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 1995-96 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $6,100. The aid ratio will be 3   determined using the combined wealth ratio, as used for operating aid, and based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. The saveharmless provision is continued. Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for public excess cost aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid now equals 50 percent of the public excess cost aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Public Excess Cost Aid will total $1,466.93 million in 1997-98, an increase of $88.41 million. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs offered by private schools and in the Stateoperated Rome and Batavia schools. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 1997-98 will total $117.98 million, an increase of $6.67 million. BOCES million. percent of districts Aid: For 1997-98, BOCES aid will total $368.47 The BOCES aid limitation holding State aid to 98 present law has been eliminated. As a result, school will receive a BOCES aid increase of $42.97 million.  Special Services Aid: This aid, which totals $139.68 million for 1997-98, an increase of $13.72 million, is provided to the Big Five city school districts for career education and computer services. Since these five districts are not permitted to join BOCES, a different formula is used to fund career education programs and computer services provided by such districts. The career education aid ceiling for 1997-98 is increased from 1996-97 and is set at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. Previously, the maximum expense had been $57.10. Transportation Aid: The minimum aid ratio for transportation aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, this aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved expenses). Transportation aid will total $713.10 million in 1997-98 an increase of $25.40 million. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred 4   only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year. Building Aid (BANS/New Debt Service): For 1997-98 building aid, a district may choose the highest of its current aid ratio or the aid ratio used for aid payable in the 1981-82 through 1996-97 school years (i.e., aid ratios based on current year or prior year selected actual valuations per resident pupil-AV/RWADA or the AV/RWADA for 1979-80 through 1994-95). For the 1997-98 school year and after, the 95 percent cap on aidable expenses pending submission of final cost reports has been eliminated. In addition, statutory provisions governing energy performance contracts have been clarified to exclude State building aid from the energy savings calculation and limit the payback period to 18 years. All building projects approved by the voters after July 1, 1998 will receive a 10 percent addition to their selected State aid ratio. Additionally, the minimum aid ratio will be 10 percent. A regional cost factor will help address the higher cost of building and repairing school facilities in certain areas of the State. These building aid enhancements will give school districts $28 million more in building aid reimbursements in 1998-99 and are expected to reach $170 million by 2001-02. As was the case last year, aid for bond anticipation notes (BANs) and for newly issued bonds and capital notes will be based on data reported to the Commissioner on or before November 15 or the actual claim submitted by the district on or before March 1. For 1997-98, building aid will total $775.36 million, an increase of $148.80 million. Reorganization Aid: Reorganization incentive aid is provided for both operating and building expenses incurred by those school districts scheduled for reorganization under section 3602 of the Education Law. It is paid as a supplement to regular operating and building aid when districts meet certain conditions prescribed by law. The statutory provisions for reorganization incentive aid remain unchanged for districts which have already undergone reorganization. Beginning in 1992, reorganization incentive operating aid for reorganizing districts was increased to 40 percent. Eligibility for reorganization incentive building aid on new projects for qualified districts was extended to July 1, 1998 in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996. In total, reorganization incentive aid will amount to $40.78 million in 1997-98, an increase of $2.79 million. 5   Growth Aid: Growth aid to qualifying districts will be paid as a separate apportionment in June 1998. As provided for in Chapter 474 of the Laws of 1996, beginning with aid for the 199798 school year, a district's growth index is calculated based on change in enrollment rather than average daily attendance. For 1997-98, growth aid will total $58.41 million, a decrease of $18.40 million. Textbook and Computer Aids: As noted previously, as part of the overall enacted budget, multi-year funding increases are provided for textbooks and computer aids. For the 1997-98 school year, the following provisions apply: C Textbook Aid: The lottery funded portion of textbook aid is $15 per pupil. The general fund portion has been increased from $21 to $25 per pupil, for a maximum total textbook aid payment of $40 per pupil. This aid will total $127.41 million in 1997-98, an increase of $12.71 million. The aid ceiling will continue to increase to $78.18 by 2001-02, resulting in a doubling of textbook aid. Computer Software Aid: Under this program, aid is apportioned to districts for the purchase and loan of computer software. Software programs designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils pursuant to Rules of the Board of Regents. Beginning with the 1997-98 school year, districts will be reimbursed for expenses up to $4.58 per pupil for 1996-97 pupils enrolled in both public and nonpublic schools. (By 2001-02 the aid ceiling will increase to $23.90.) For 1997-98, computer software aid will total $11.03 million, an increase of $1.09 million. Computer Hardware and Technology Aid: This aid category, which is no longer subject to the transition adjustment, provides funding for the lease or purchase of mini- and microcomputers, computer terminals or technology equipment for instructional purposes. Computer hardware aid equals approved expense (up to $10.61), adjusted by the current year AV/RWADA aid ratio, per pupil. For the 1997-98 school year, $13.36 million, an increase of $2.59 million, is provided in the enacted budget. Between 1997-98 and 2001-02 the formula aid ceiling will increase to $32.35, a four-fold increase over the 1996-97 ceiling of $8.00 per pupil.  C  C  Library Materials Aid: Districts are reimbursed for expenses up to $4.00 per pupil for 1996-97 pupils enrolled in 6   public and nonpublic schools. For 1997-98, library materials aid will total $12.42 million. Materials purchased under this program and designated for use in public schools are to be loaned on an equitable basis to nonpublic school pupils. NONCOMPUTERIZED AIDS Teacher Support Aid: A total of $67.48 million is provided in aid and grants to the Big Five City School Districts. This amount includes an increase of $10 million to New York City. Aid to Small City School Districts: Aid for small city school districts was instituted as a grant program by Chapter 288 of the Laws of 1979, and was intended to provide funds to districts at or near constitutional tax limits. With the removal of small city constitutional tax limits by a referendum in 1985, aid to small city school districts is provided to permit such districts to adjust their taxes gradually to an appropriate level. A total of $81.87 million, the same amount as in 1996-97, will be allocated to small city school districts for the 1997-98 school year. Employment Preparation Education (EPE) Aid: EPE funding available for adult education programs such as literacy, basic skills and high school equivalency programs. School districts and BOCES offering such programs are required to submit plans service to the Commissioner of Education for approval. Total for the 1997-98 school year continues to be capped at $96.18 million, and approved claims above such amount will be subject proration. is of aid to  Urban-Suburban Transfer: A total of $1.13 million will be provided in 1997-98 to districts that participate in a voluntary interdistrict transfer between an urban and suburban school district to reduce racial isolation. Related transportation expenses are eligible for transportation aid. Education of Homeless Children: Chapter 348 of the Laws of 1988, by amending section 3602 of the Education Law, instituted this program of State aid. Under this program, school districts where homeless children are temporarily located are reimbursed for the direct cost of educating such children. This cost to the State is partially recaptured from the district of last attendance for each such homeless child by deducting an amount equal to the district's basic contribution per pupil from the district's State aid. The net cost of aid for homeless pupils in 1997-98 is estimated at $4.0 million.  7   Aid for Incarcerated Youth: A total of $10.5 million is provided to continue support for the provision of educational services to youth detained in local correctional facilities. Pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 53 of the Laws of 1992, such services may now be provided, and aided, during summer sessions as well as the regular school year. Reorganization Study Grants: In addition to regular reorganization aid, the Commissioner of Education is empowered to provide reorganization study grants of up to $50,000 to encourage school districts to study the feasibility of combining with adjacent districts. In addition, $20,000 grants may be provided for the study of collaborative delivery systems, and training therefor, for school-age, at-risk youth. Such grants are also available for administrative and operational reviews of individual school districts. A total of $1.28 million is provided for such grants in 1997-98. State Bilingual Categorical Funds: In 1997-98, $11.20 million will be used to continue existing funding of regional bilingual programs at BOCES and to support innovative Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs which employ two languages (one of which is English) for the purpose of instruction, involving students whose native language is other than English. Categorical Reading Aid: This aid category is provided to the Big Five city school districts to help improve pupil reading skills and academic performance. Aid payments will total $63.95 million in 1997-98, the same amount as last year, to be distributed as follows:      New York City Buffalo Syracuse Rochester Yonkers $29.95 17.50 6.00 5.50 5.00 million million million million million  AI/DP Grants: $949,900 is available in 1997-98, for attendance improvement and drop-out prevention programs.

Pre-kindergarten Programs: Pre-kindergarten programs provide health, psychological and social services to four-yearold children from economically deprived neighborhoods. A total of $50.2 million has been budgeted for the 1997-98 school year. Grants to support existing programs will be awarded based on Regulations of the Commissioner subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget. Beginning in the 1998-99 school year, an additional $50 million will be made available for this program as the first phase of a multi-year STAR initiative discussed below. Lunch/Breakfast Programs: $31.7 million in State funds, the same as last year, including support for additional expenses of school breakfast programs for schools with extraordinary needs, is appropriated to subsidize school lunch and school breakfast programs.

STAR Property Tax Relief  Chapter 389 of the Laws of 1997 includes a multi-year School TAx Relief (STAR) program that will provide approximately $2.2 billion by 2001-02 to reimburse school districts for Stateauthorized property tax relief for homeowners. When fully implemented, the property tax component of the STAR program will provide homeowners with at least a $30,000 exemption from the full value of their primary residence for school property tax purposes. Senior homeowners at least 65 years old and with incomes up to $60,000 will receive exemptions of at least $50,000 from the full value of their primary residences for school tax purposes. The State will reimburse school districts dollar-fordollar for the property tax revenues foregone from these exemptions. STAR property tax exemptions will be phased-in, beginning with a $12,500 exemption for income-eligible senior homeowners for 1998-99 school year taxes. Senior exemptions will be increased to $25,000 in 1999-2000, $37,500 in 2000-01 and $50,000 in 2001-02. Other homeowners will be eligible for exemptions of: $10,000 in 1999-2000; $20,000 in 2000-01; and $30,000 in 2001-02. In those counties where the median value of homes exceeds the statewide median home value, as determined by the State Office of Real Property Services (ORPS), the value of the exemptions will be increased. A ""Property Taxpayer's Bill of Rights"" included in Chapter 389 provides that property tax bills include additional information, including the estimated full value of the property and the uniform percentage of value at which a municipality is assessing properties. Information on how to appeal assessments must be provided with the bill or through another notice. While local assessors will process applications for STAR property tax exemptions, school districts are required to notify residential property owners that they may qualify for such relief and must apply to their local assessor by the applicable taxable status date to receive the exemption. STAR exemptions will have no levies, rates or other State aid. reimbursed for the taxes foregone Office of Real Property Services.

Upon defeat of a school budget by voters, contingency budget increases will be capped at the lesser of 4 percent or 120 percent of the CPI. Districts adopting a contingency budget must also limit their administrative component to a percentage of the budget that is the lower of the previous year's percentage or that for the first rejected budget.

The 1997-98 budget enacts a multi-year commitment of State aid to expand pre-kindergarten programs, to reduce class sizes to foster an improved learning environment for children, and to preserve and expand school facilities. In addition, education programs are strengthened by providing additional funding for textbooks, computers and other educational technology. Major initiatives which will begin in the 1998-99 school year include: C A $50 million increase in aid for pre-kindergarten programs for four-year-old children ($500 million when fully implemented in 2001-02). A minimum of $2,000 and a maximum of $4,000 is provided for each pre-school child in a school district, based on wealth. Districts would be required to develop a plan in conjunction with local child-care agencies and pre-schools for providing pre-school education.  17   Provision of services would be a local option and not a mandate. C An estimated $28 million enhancement of the building aid formula to reflect regional costs and to support a State building aid enrichment that would add 10 percent to each school district's aid ratio up to a maximum of 95 percent ($170 million by 2001-02). The minimum aid ratio will be 10 percent. In addition, $50 million will be available for minor maintenance projects ($80 million by 2001-02). Textbooks and computer aids will receive $3 million in additional State funding in 1998-99, an amount which will increase to $120 million by 2001-02. By 2001-02 the computer hardware per pupil aid ceiling will increase fourfold over that for 1996-97; the computer software per pupil aid ceiling will increase five-fold. Furthermore, districts will be allowed to purchase computers through vendors and receive aid equivalent to BOCES aid. Big 5 city schools and other non-component districts will also receive aid on computer purchases at an aid ratio equivalent to BOCES aid, up to the amount appropriated statewide. Funding for education technology will expand by $9 million in 1998-99 and by an additional $91 million when fully implemented. An additional $1.5 million will be provided for instructional staff development grants ($10.0 million by 2000-01). In addition, the Big 5 city school districts will be able to contract for professional development through BOCES, on their own, or in collaboration with higher education institutions. Such expenses will be eligible for aid at a BOCES aid ratio, up to the amount appropriated statewide. Additional State aid, on a per pupil basis, will be provided to districts that decide to establish full-day kindergarten programs during the next five years.  C  C  C  C  Beginning in the 1999-2000 school year, $75 million in additional State aid will be available for reducing class sizes. This aid will increase to $225 million by 2001-02. The enacted budget also establishes a new $25 million Tax Freeze program that will provide State aid to those districts that voluntarily freeze or reduce their property taxes beginning with the 1999-2000 school year. 18   OTHER INITIATIVES There are several components of the 1997-98 enacted budget which will effect BOCES: C For the 1997-98 school year and after, all BOCES must develop a report card highlighting the fiscal and academic performance of the BOCES and its component schools plus comparing these measures to a statewide average for all BOCES.

C  C  Each BOCES must make public information regarding the total salary of its district superintendent including health insurance, travel expenses and other items. The Commissioner of Education will conduct a study of the services now provided to school districts by BOCES and will develop recommendations for reforming the approval process for new and existing services.  C  Chapter 436 of the Laws of 1997 also includes a number of provisions affecting special education by: C Requiring SED, in consultation with Advisory Panel for Special Education recommendations to the Governor and December 1, 1998 concerning ways to placements to special education; Extending 1997 which number of education for one provide disabled classes; the Commissioner's and others, to make the Legislature by reduce inappropriate  C  year provisions of law set to expire in school districts with flexibility in the students who may be enrolled in special and  C  Directing SED to require districts with rates of referral to special education which are significantly higher than the statewide average, with significant documented problems or which over-rely on restrictive placements, to submit an explanation for each identified issue.  19   II SUMMARY OF 1997-98 SCHOOL YEAR/FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATIONS School Year/Fiscal Year Impact There are two time frames to consider when discussing 199798 New York State aid programs relating to support for public schools: the 1997-98 school year which runs from July 1, 1997 through June 30, 1998; and the 1997-98 State fiscal year which runs from April 1, 1997 through March 31, 1998.

There are 78 districts that are projected to have losses of $24.13 million. The combined total of increases and losses produce a net increase statewide of $650.20 million, or 6.71 percent.  Table II-D lists the aid amounts allocated to each of the Big Five city school districts under 23 selected General Support programs. The aids analyzed are those shown in Table II-A. The table shows that Yonkers had the largest percentage increase (8.97 percent) of the Big Five cities. Table II-E lists changes in all General Support individual aid categories for New York City. The net increase for all aids is 7.43 percent. In Table II-F, 20 major 1997-98 aid categories have been combined to show the overall impact upon school districts in the State's 18 most populous counties, New York City, and the rest of the State. The State average increase for these aids will be 6.71 percent. The 371 districts in the 18 most populous counties contain 46.81 percent of the State's public school pupils. These districts will receive 43.61 percent of the 1997-98 combined aids total. Districts in the 18 most populous counties will have an average combined aids increase of 6.78 percent. Districts in the rest of the State, exclusive of New York City, will have an average increase of 5.44 percent and will receive 21.25 percent of the 1997-98 combined aids total.      25   TABLE II-D SUMMARY OF SELECTED AIDS TO THE BIG FIVE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCED THROUGH GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS APPROPRIATIONS: 1996-97 AND 1997-98 New York City Buffalo Rochester Syracuse Yonkers 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 1996-97 1997-98 (---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Amounts in Millions ---------------------------------------------------------------------------) $2,044.32 $2,080.06 $132.21 $131.68 $97.14 $99.75 $67.04 $68.01 $29.48 $31.62 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 34.10 49.69 14.96 26.69 8.13 12.28 0.00 0.00 5.20 5.28 0.24 0.24 0.18 0.19 0.12 0.12 0.11 0.12 48.41 57.73 1.34 1.38 1.24 1.27 0.57 0.55 0.99 1.03 (71.58) (25.53) (19.64) (28.07) (33.57) (39.51) (14.02) (15.75) (19.98) (18.28) $2,026.36 $2,117.54 $148.25 $154.92 $79.95 $88.39 $61.84 $65.21 $10.60 $14.49 284.83 4.40 55.79 16.43 488.57 103.54 179.46 182.73 41.38 $3,383.49 352.74 5.93 62.54 23.20 546.56 114.50 167.41 210.12 33.16 $3,633.69 $250.20 7.39% 15.17 0.28 2.47 1.06 39.86 8.87 20.64 1.79 0.00 $238.39 17.25 0.37 2.65 1.35 41.98 10.08 22.14 2.52 0.00 $253.26 $14.87 6.24% 12.52 0.20 1.82 0.81 37.46 5.11 21.18 15.08 1.55 $175.68 16.24 0.28 2.11 1.13 39.07 5.82 20.69 16.61 0.40 $190.74 $15.06 8.57% 5.89 0.14 0.83 0.51 22.18 5.85 8.93 8.08 1.34 $115.59 6.51 0.19 1.16 0.62 24.00 5.85 8.39 7.13 1.90 $120.96 $5.37 4.65% 4.86 0.06 1.27 0.25 12.18 2.60 4.88 1.26 1.00 $38.96 6.13 0.04 1.48 0.36 13.32 3.43 5.15 1.49 0.60 $46.49 $7.53 19.33%  AID CATEGORY I.

EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION EDUCATION (EPE) AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 24 Districts are eligible for EPE aid for the attendance of pupils age 21 or older who have not received a high school diploma or equivalency diploma. Beginning in 1991-92, aid paid directly to BOCES for approved BOCES EPE programs is based on component districts' aid ratios. Beginning in 1995-96, the BOCES EPE aid ratio is based on the aggregate actual valuation and TWPU of the component districts of the BOCES. Adults can register with BOCES for participation at a BOCES site. Beginning in 1996-97, the BOCES EPE aid ratio is the greater of the EPE aid ratio based on the aggregate wealth of the component districts or 85 percent of the highest EPE aid ratio of a component district of the BOCES. EPE Aid = $6.10 x EPE Aid Ratio x EPE Hours EPE Aid Ratio = 1 - (Pupil Wealth Ratio x .40) Minimum: .400 1994 Actual Valuation/TWPU State Average Full Value/TWPU ($251,100)  Pupil Wealth Ratio =  EPE Hours = Total hours of instruction for all students in EPE programs between July 1 and June 30 of the current year. EPE aid will be reduced if it and other State and Federal sources of aid for EPE programs exceed the entire cost of such program in that year. For the 1997-98 school year, total aid is limited to $96.18 million. INCARCERATED YOUTH AID Education Law, Section 3602, Subdivision 35 All districts are eligible for incarcerated youth aid.

Average Daily Attendance/Average Daily Membershipa A. Average Daily Attendance (ADA) is the average number of pupils present on each regular school day in a given period, such average is determined by dividing the total number of attendance days of all pupils by the number of days school was in session. Average Daily Membership (ADM) is a measure of enrollment. It is the total possible aggregate daily attendance of all pupils in the district divided by the days of session.  B.  II.

Section 3609-a includes all computerized aids except Textbook, Software, and Library Materials aids and Excess Cost aids which are covered under the section 3609-b payment schedule (which also includes Medicaid payments). Growth Aid and Building Aid for new debt service and BANS are not paid until June, 1998. Small Cities Aid for 1997-98 is covered by section 3609c and BOCES Aid for 1997-98 by section 3609-d. As was the case last year, for the 1997-98 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 State Aid to Localities Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998. The payment schedule has several features: General Aids C C Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November. ""Fixed"" payments will be paid in the months of October, November and December. These payments guarantee that a ""fixed"" percentage of a district's apportionments, after TRS payments, will be paid through the sum of Lottery payments and regular aid payments by given points in time: 12.50 percent by October 15, 18.75 percent by November 15 and 25.00 percent by December 15. ""Individualized"" payments will be calculated for the months of January through June, based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 1998. If necessary, the March payment may also be reduced to ensure that no more than the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools is expended by March 31. Sustaining advance payments and a final payment for the State Fiscal Year will be paid to school districts on March 31 on a prorata basis using the district's relative share of either: (1) for the sustaining advance payments, the total monies designated for payment in April, then May and finally June or (2) for the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the total monies designated for June (if a positive payment is to be made) or the total monies designated for March (if a negative deduction is to be made). For purposes of calculating the final payment for the State Fiscal Year, the remaining unexpended portion of the State Fiscal Year appropriations for General Support of Public Schools will be used. Any aids payable for new debt service and bond anticipation notes (BANS) or for Growth Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. However, for  C  C  C  C  52   new debt service or bond anticipation notes (BANS), if the actual claim is submitted by March 1 then the district will receive the lesser of the aid based on 11/15/97 data or the actual claim submitted on or before 3/1/98. In addition, such aid payable through June cannot exceed the aid for new debt service or BANS as it appears on computer listing ""SA9798"". C Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998.  Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Reimbursement). Such State share monies will be paid in conjunction with the scheduled monthly payment of federal share monies for Medicaid Reimbursement. Any remaining balances of Excess Cost Aids will be paid in accordance with the schedule below. Total Excess Cost Aids payable to a district for the school year may not exceed the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 Aid to Localities Budget. C The positive remainder of 25 percent of Excess Cost Aids minus any State share monies paid in the months of August-November, 1997 will be paid on December 15. The positive remainder of 70 percent of such aids minus any apportionment previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-February 1998 will be paid on March 15. The positive remainder of 85 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-May 1998 will be paid on June 15. The positive remainder of 100 percent of such aids minus any apportionments previously paid and any State share monies payable in the months of August 1997-July 1998 will be paid on August 15. Any excess of actual Excess Cost Aids payable over the sum of such aids as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9697,"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 1998.  C  C  C  C  BOCES Aida C BOCES Aid is calculated by individual component school district of the BOCES, but the sum of all such payments are paid directly to the BOCES. Total BOCES Aid payable for the school year to each component school district may not exceed 100 percent of the amount of such aid as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" which was released in August 1997 with enactment of the 1997-98 Aid to Localities Budget. BOCES obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will be paid by the State on behalf of the BOCES from the apportionment payable to the BOCES by the fifteenth of each of the months of September, October and November. By February 1 an additional payment will be made to BOCES equal to 25 percent of the total BOCES Aid payable for the school year less the payments made to TRS on the BOCES' behalf. BOCES Aid for special act, less-than-eight teacher, and special contracting districts will be added to the ""SA9798"" amounts. a  C  C  53   C  An additional payment will be made to the BOCES on the first business day of June equal to 55 percent of the lesser of actual BOCES Aid payable to each component school district or the amount of BOCES Aid payable to each component school district as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798,"" minus the sum of all previous payments including payments made to TRS on the BOCES behalf. Any remaining apportionment payable to the BOCES, including any excess of actual BOCES Aid payable over the amount of such aid reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA9798"" will be paid to the BOCES on the first business day of September, 1998.  C  Aid to Small City School Districts Payments to small city school districts will be made pursuant to Section 3609-c of the Education Law.

For the 2003-04 school year, funding for General Support for Public Schools will be reduced by $185.84 million, or 1.27 percent, from $14,615.60 million to $14,429.76 million. Major elements of State support for elementary and secondary education include the following:  An overall decrease of $185.84 million (1.27 percent) in school aid, including a decrease of $206.80 million (1.48 percent)in formula-based computerized aids. A new Comprehensive Operating Aid totalling $6,840.78 million which will replace four previous aid categories and which incorporates a reduction of $285.35 million, or 4.00 percent. A $18.63 million, or 2.71 percent, increase to a total of $704.91 million in funding for Extraordinary Needs Aid for districts with concentrations of at-risk pupils. An increase of $42.95 million (1.88 percent) to a total of $2,332.94 million for Public and Private Excess Cost Aid funding for programs for pupils with disabilities. To promote the education of disabled children with their non-disabled peers, and to generate additional aid for such children, a pupil weighting of 0.5 continues to be added to the existing public excess cost aid weighting for severely disabled children. These are children who require special education services at least 60 percent of the time and who receive such services in a general education setting. Funding of $201.04 million is provided for Universal Prekindergarten Aid and funding of $136.40 million is          1   available for Class Size Reduction Aid.1 Minor Maintenance Aid is continued at $49.97 million. An allocation of $5.64 million is provided for Full-Day Kindergarten Incentive Aid, reflecting a decrease of $11.56 million due to a decline in new incentive grant applications from school districts.  Building Aid funding of $1,168.69 million, a decrease of $115.20 million. This funding level reflects full implementation of recent reforms whereby the State will reimburse its share of school construction projects over the useful life of the project. Reforms will also authorize 2003-04 Building Aid payments for projects for which a construction contract has been signed and notification received by the State Education Department by February 15, 2003. Projects for which notification is received by the State Education Department after such date are eligible for Building Aid in 2004-05. A total of $264.13 million, an increase of $0.34 million, is provided for expense-based instructional materials aids including the textbook, software and hardware aid categories. Computer Software Aid is increased by $0.47 million or 1.03 percent. Textbook Aid will decrease by $0.83 million or 0.44 percent. Computer Hardware Aid is increased by $0.70 million or 2.53 percent. An increase of $93.37 million, for a total of $1,093.37 million, is provided for expense-based Transportation Aid. Statewide, up to $5.00 million continues to be available for reimbursement of summer school transportation expenses. A total of $35.82 million, a decrease of $5.34 million (12.97 percent), is available to fund school district summer programs to improve student performance in required academic subjects or to prepare for Regents examinations. Aid for BOCES services will total $522.02 million, an increase of $27.45 million or 5.55 percent.          1  Legislation enacted with the 2003-04 State Budget provides for program totals of up to $204.68 million for Universal Prekindergarten Aid and up to $139.97 million for Class Size Reduction Aid.  2     For the 2003-04 school year, $122.16 million will be available for Special Services Aid for career education programs and school computer services. This aid is provided to both Big Five City school districts and other districts that are non-components of BOCES. Formula revisions will enhance funding for Limited English Proficiency Aid ($86.49 million) and for Tax Limitation Aid ($29.96 million). Continued General Support for Public School funding at 2002-03 levels is provided for various categorical aid programs including Teacher Support Aid ($67.48 million), Small Cities Aid ($81.88 million) and Bilingual Grants ($11.20 million). The Teacher-Mentor Intern program will be funded at $4.00 million, a decrease of $1.00 million, while Teacher Centers will be funded at a level of up to $31.00 million. The ""Teachers of Tomorrow"" initiative will be funded at $20.00 million, a decrease of $5.00 million. This program provides assistance to school districts, including the Big Five City schools, in their efforts to increase the supply of qualified entry-level teachers and to improve teacher retention. The 2003-04 State Budget provides funding of $90.00 million, an increase of $33.00 million, for payment of statewide prior year claims and/or fiscal stabilization grants. This includes up to $62.00 million for payment to New York City. STAR property tax relief will increase by $136 million, from $2.12 billion in 2002-03 to an estimated $2.26 billion in 2003-04, to support the $50,000 full value exemption for income-eligible seniors and the $30,000 full value exemption for other homeowners. Enacted in the 2002-03 budget, the STAR cost of living adjustment (COLA) for senior income eligibility will raise the income ceiling from $60,000 to $62,100. This COLA will ensure that modest increases in Social Security or other retirement income will not make seniors who              3   receive enhanced STAR benefits ineligible in future years. In addition, legislation was enacted which provides seniors with the option of having their income eligibility for the enhanced STAR benefit verified by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Seniors who elect the income verification option as part of their application for the 2003-04 school year will not have to reapply for the exemption in the following years. They will be automatically renewed as long as their income eligibility and homeowner status remain unchanged.  2003-04 SCHOOL AID PROGRAMS Most major formula provisions remain unchanged for the 2003-04 school year. However, the enacted Budget does include changes in Comprehensive Operating Aid, Extraordinary Needs Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Tax Limitation Aid and Building Aid. A. GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS The enacted school aid program will decrease the aids comprising General Support for Public Schools (GSPS) by $185.84 million, from $14,615.60 million in 2002-03 to $14,429.76 million in the 2003-04 school year, a reduction of 1.27 percent. Formula-based computerized aids will decrease by $206.80 million, or 1.48 percent, to $13,800.73 million. FORMULA-BASED AIDS Comprehensive Operating Aid: For 2003-04, school districts statewide will receive $6,840.78 million in new Comprehensive Operating Aid  a decrease of $285.35 million, or 4.00 percent. The Comprehensive Operating Aid category now consolidates four 2002-03 aids into a single funding source. The combined aid replaces Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid. For 2003-04, school district aid totals also incorporate a wealth- and pupilbased formula reduction which will affect all districts, however, low wealth districts and districts with a high proportion of at-risk pupils will experience a lesser reduction.  4   Comprehensive Operating Aid decreases will be allocated based on the following two-step calculation:  Aid provided to each district will be reduced by an amount equal to 1.75 percent of its 2002-03 total for the four consolidated aid categories noted above. An additional reduction amount will be calculated using free and reduced price lunch and school district combined wealth data. The higher the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced price lunch programs and the lower the per pupil income and property wealth of the district, the smaller the amount of the district's additional reduction. The combined reduction for districts will range from 2.25 percent to 6.30 percent of their 2002-03 aid total for Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid.      Extraordinary Needs Aid: This aid category provides funds to school districts with high concentrations of limited English proficient and other at-risk pupils. For the 2003-04 school year, the formula includes a recalculation of the concentration factor which provides additional aid to districts with more than 74.5 percent of their students identified as at-risk pupils. The save-harmless provision is continued and guarantees that no district will receive less aid than it received in 2002-03. Extraordinary Needs Aid will provide $704.91 million to school districts, an increase of $18.63 million. Public Excess Cost Aid: Public Excess Cost Aid will total $2,152.46 million in 2003-04, an increase of $35.81 million. This program supports the additional costs of providing a free and appropriate education in a public school setting for students with disabilities. Aid payable in 2003-04 will be calculated based on approved operating expense and total aidable pupils for expense of the 2001-02 school year. The statewide average approved operating expense per pupil is $7,650. The aid ratio is determined using the Combined Wealth Ratio and is based on a 49 percent State share for a district of average wealth and a minimum aid ratio of 25 percent. For 2003-04, the public excess cost pupil weightings continue to contain a 0.5 weighting for those children who required special education services in the year prior to the base year at least 60 percent of the time and who received these 5   services in a general education setting. The pupil weighting for students requiring special education services more than 60 percent of the day in the base year will be 1.65 for aid paid in 2003-04. The save-harmless provision ensures that no district will receive less than 95 percent of the aid amount paid for 2002-03. (Integrated settings aid is not subject to the Public Excess Cost Aid save-harmless calculation.) Funding for the Declassification Support Services Aid program is also included within the estimates for Public Excess Cost Aid. Under this program, moneys are provided to school districts for the provision of support services for teachers and pupils in the first year that a pupil moves from a special education program to a full-time regular education program. In order to encourage the increased movement of pupils into a regular classroom environment, this aid equals 50 percent of a district's Public Excess Cost Aid per pupil multiplied by the number of pupils moving to a regular education program. Private Excess Cost Aid: This program supports special education programs serving public school children placed in private school settings and in the State-operated schools in Rome and Batavia. All existing provisions of law are continued. State funding in 2003-04 will total $180.48 million, an increase of $7.14 million. Educationally Related Support Services Aid: This formula supports school district programs for students at risk of requiring special education services. It continues to include two per pupil aid calculations. The first uses a $365.00 aid ceiling, selected TAPU, and the formula Operating Aid ratio with a .25 minimum2. The second uses a $635.00 aid ceiling, selected TAPU, the Extraordinary Needs percent (to the extent that the percentage of students with Extraordinary Needs is in excess of 60 percent) and the aid ratio for Public Excess Cost Aid. The percent of selected TAPU for the first per-pupil calculation is 9 percent; that for the second is 15 percent. For 2003-04, this aid will total $72.48 million, an increase of $2.11 million. BOCES Aid: For 2003-04, aid to reimburse districts for expenditures for BOCES services in the 2002-03 school year will total $522.02 million, an increase of $27.45 million. The use of BOCES in the provision of Academic Intervention Services (AIS) 2  Formula Operating Aid components (as described in subdivision 12 of Section 3602 of the Education Law) will be used where appropriate to the aid category calculation, such as for Educationally Related Support Services Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid and Growth Aid.  6   to improve student performance must continue to be approved by the State Education Department to be aid eligible. Districts must demonstrate, not only that district resources were insufficient to provide appropriate Academic Intervention Services, but that accessing BOCES services is a cost-effective solution. Special Services Aid: Special Services Aid funds career education programs and computer services for school districts which are not components of a BOCES. The career education aid ceiling for 2003-04 is continued at $3,720. Computer services aid is based upon an aid ratio multiplied by expenses up to $62.30 multiplied by the district's K-12 enrollment. For 200304, this aid will total $122.16 million, a decrease of $4.83 million. Transportation Aid: Transportation Aid will total $1,093.37 million in 2003-04, an increase of $93.37 million. The minimum aid ratio for Transportation Aid continues to be 6.5 percent (dependent on district wealth, aid will range from 6.5 to 90 percent of a district's approved transportation expenses). The aid ratio choice permitting school districts to receive aid based on public and non-public enrollments is continued and will benefit districts transporting large numbers of nonpublic school students. District expenditures for transportation to and from school district operated summer classes to improve student performance will be aided up to a maximum of $5.00 million statewide. Districts may claim aid based on the transportation of pupils in summer school courses to improve performance during the summer of 2002. Schools will continue to receive aid for non-emergency bus purchases or leases in the year after the expense is incurred only if the amount expended is reported to the Commissioner of Education by November 15th of the base year. Any amount exceeding the reported figure will be aided in the subsequent year.

There are 251 districts that are projected to have increases of $101.99 million. The combined total of increases and reductions produce a net decrease statewide of $206.80 million, or 1.48 percent.  Table II-C lists the aid amounts allocated to each of the Big Five city school districts under selected General Support programs. The aids analyzed are those shown in Table II-A. Table II-D lists changes in all General Support individual aid categories for New York City. The net decrease for all aids is 1.01 percent. In Table II-E, major 2003-04 aid categories have been combined to show the overall impact upon school districts in the State's 18 most populous counties, New York City, and the rest of the State. The State average decrease for these aids will be 1.48 percent. The 371 districts in the 18 most populous counties contain 48.36 percent of the State's public school pupils. These districts will receive 43.30 percent of the 2003-04 combined aids total. Districts in the 18 most populous counties will have an average decrease in combined aids of 1.30 percent. Districts in the rest of the State, exclusive of New York City, will have an average decrease of 1.91 percent and will receive 19.62 percent of the 2003-04 combined aids total.      25   TABLE II-C SUMMARY OF SELECTED AIDS TO THE BIG FIVE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICTS FINANCED THROUGH GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS APPROPRIATIONS: 2002-03 AND 2003-04 New York City AID CATEGORY I.

Each of the appendices is described below.  Appendix III-A summarizes the School Aid categories and adjustments enacted for 2003-04 and compares them with the 2002-03 aid categories. Appendix III-B provides the mathematical formulas for computing 23 different aids for 2003-04 school aid payments. Appendix III-C describes the pupil counts used in aid formulas. Appendix III-D describes the payment schedule for aids payable under section 3609 of the Education Law in the 2003-04 school year.       29   APPENDIX III-A COMPARISON OF 2002-03 AND 2003-04 GENERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PROGRAMS Category COMPREHENSIVE OPERATING AID 2002-03 School Year No district will receive less that the Flex Aid amount allocated for each district in the school aid computer listing entitled ""BT032-1"" which accompanied the 2001-02 Executive Budget minus the 2000-01 school year amounts payable for Extraordinary Needs Aid, Minor Maintenance Aid, Public and Private Excess Cost Aid, Limited English Proficiency Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Educationally Related Support Services Aid and Operating Standards Aid. Districts with a Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR)5 less than 1.000 will receive an additional one percent in Comprehensive Operating Aid. 2003-04 School Year School districts statewide will receive aid equal to the 2002-03 sum of Comprehensive Operating Aid, Gifted and Talented Aid, Operating Standards Aid and Academic Support Aid minus a reduction calculation described below. Each district will be assessed a reduction amount equal to 1.75 percent of its 2002-03 total for the 4 aid categories noted above. All districts will be assessed an additional reduction amount calculated using Free and Reduced Price Lunch (FRPL) data and the school district's Combined Wealth Ratio (CWR).

The assumed amortization is based on approved project costs, the term of borrowing and an assumed interest rate. New projects subject to prospective assumed amortization are those that were either approved by the Commissioner of Education on or after December 1, 2001, or, for which debt (bonds, BANs, and capital notes) is first issued on or after such date. Each project is assigned a useful life, cost allowance and assumed interest rate. The State share of financing costs associated with refinancings are reimbursed in full to districts. In addition, districts are reimbursed for lease expenses and on a one year lag for costs of exceptional expenses including metal detectors, condition surveys, and capital outlay exception. Selected Aid Ratio: Districts may use the higher of the current year aid ratio or the aid ratio computed for use in any year commencing with the 1981-82 school year. Starting with all new building projects approved by the voters after July 1, 2000, the selected building aid ratio is based upon the greater of a school district's current-year building aid ratio or the aid ratio selected for use in 1999-00 reduced by 10 percentage points. School districts with a pupil wealth ratio greater than 2.50 and an alternate pupil wealth ratio less than .850 may select an aid ratio equal to 1.263 multiplied by the district's Formula Operating Aid Ratio. Incentive: For aid payable in 1998-99 and after for new projects approved by the voters after 7/1/98, districts will continue to receive an additional 10 percent State reimbursement. However, the sum of the incentive and the selected aid ratio may not exceed .950. In addition, cost allowances on all contracts awarded after 7/1/98 will be adjusted to reflect regional costs for school districts in high cost areas of the State.

Since 1991-92, aid paid directly to BOCES for approved BOCES EPE programs has been based on component districts' aid ratios. Beginning in 1995-96, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been based on the aggregate actual valuation and TWPU of the component districts of the BOCES. Adults can register with BOCES for participation at a BOCES site. Since 1996-97, the BOCES EPE aid ratio has been the greater of the EPE aid ratio based on the aggregate wealth of the component districts or 85 percent of the highest EPE aid ratio of a component district of the BOCES. EPE Aid = $7.65 x EPE Aid Ratio x EPE Hours EPE Aid Ratio = 1  (Pupil Wealth Ratio x .40) Minimum: .400  51   Pupil Wealth Ratio = 2000 Actual Valuation/2001-02 TWPU State Average ($281,000) EPE Hours = Total hours of instruction for all students in EPE programs between July 1 and June 30 of the current year.

For GSPS aid payable in the 2003-04 school year, school districts will receive the lesser of (i) the sum of the aid calculated at the time of enactment of the Aid to Localities Budget or (ii) actual claims at the time of payment. A district may not exceed the sum of apportionments reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA030-4,"" which was released in April 2003 with the issuance of the 2003-04 Budget. Any remaining unpaid amount of aid due to a school district will be paid on the first business day of September, 2004. The payment schedule has several features: GSPS Aids   Lottery Aid will continue to be paid in full on or before September 1. School district obligations to the New York State Teachers Retirement System (TRS) will continue to be paid by the State on behalf of school districts in September, October and November.

""Individualized"" payments will be calculated for the months of January through June. January through May payments are based on school district State Aid claims or data available to the Commissioner as of December 1. The June payment is based on data available to the Commissioner as of May 1. These will be calculated to guarantee that each district receives 50 percent of the sum of its State and local revenues by the first business day of January, 60 percent by February, 70 percent by March, 80 percent by April and 90 percent by May. All of the April payment, all, or most of the May payment and some of the June payment may be paid as part of the sustaining advance payments and the final payment for the State Fiscal Year in order to fully expend the State Fiscal Year appropriation for General Support of Public Schools in March 2004.

Any aid payable for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid will be paid in addition to any remaining balance of the June General Aid payment on the first business day in June. In addition the total of such aid payable through June for Growth Aid and Full Day Kindergarten Aid cannot exceed the total of such aid as it appears on the computer listing ""SA030-4."" Any excess of actual General Aid apportionments over the sum of such apportionments as reported in the school aid computer listing entitled ""SA030-4"" will be paid on the first business day of September, 2004.      STAR Aid  STAR exemptions have no effect on determining tax levies, rates or other State aid. School districts are reimbursed for the taxes foregone upon application to the State Office of Real Property Services. ORPS certifies amounts payable under the STAR program to the Commissioner of Education and school districts receive reimbursement from the State Education Department pursuant to a separate STAR payment schedule established in section 3609-e of the Education Law. STAR reimbursements commencing in the 2003-04 school year are governed by a formula designed to ensure that outstanding STAR balances do not exceed specified percentages of a district's property tax levy. Assuming timely filing of claims by districts, any STAR amounts that exceed 25% of a district's property tax levy will be paid in October. Remaining STAR amounts that exceed 20% of levy will be paid in November and STAR owed in excess of 15% of levy will be paid in December. The balance of STAR due to districts will be paid by the first business day of January. Any increase in STAR aid that occurs as a result of adjustments that are made after the January payment will be paid by March 31, 2004. Payment amounts will be based on current data on file at the time of each payment through January. Current statutory provisions that authorize the Commissioner to withhold State aid payments from school districts that have not submitted enrollment and expenditure data on a timely basis shall not apply to STAR aid payments.       57   Excess Cost Aids Section 3609-b of the Education Law requires that apportionments payable to school districts for Excess Cost Aids shall be designated as State share monies due to school districts pursuant to Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid reimbursement).
