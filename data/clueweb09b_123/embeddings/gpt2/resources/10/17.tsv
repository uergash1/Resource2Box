(we're all war-minded right now, you know. it's easy for the media to distract us by throwing us into our own verbal wars here at home.) ) what to do, what to do.... the rest of the public is given an animation of rick warren... and then my wife meets the man behind the projections, the quotes, the ""OTHER SIDE"". and he is warm, caring, effusive, and LOVES gays.""    -- Melissa Etheridge's wife, Tammy Lynn Michaels, blogging about Melissa's phone call and subsequent  meeting with Rick Warren  over the weekend.

If Warren loves gays, why does he say we need to 'repent' of our 'homosexual sin' in order to become members and serve in his church? This baffles me.    Happy Holidays,    EP                  Existential Punk  |  December 22, 2008 11:28 AM Reply to this comment                               Melissa has a Xmas album out and Rick Warren said he loved it.  All his sheep people at Saddleback will like to buy it also.  Melissa melted. I don't have anything to sell so I am not giving him any slack.  The policy of the Saddleback church is to not accept any openly LGBT's as members.  Melissa and her wife can attend as guests only.

They didn't get married, remember?  They had the same chance the rest of us did, they didn't do it.  I did.  I have a wife, I have a marriage.  They have neither and so forgive me if I ask both of them to shut the hell up as spokespeople for married gay folk like me.    The words may not matter to some people (like Michaels', who said on Oprah following Prop 8's passage that if the word 'marriage' is such a big deal, we should just take a 'civil union' instead) --but for me , the words do matter -- and they certainly matter to Rick Warren and his ilk.    It's not hard to see why we continue to have our asses handed to us by these people (elitists on left, evangelicals on the right, politicians everywhere), when all it takes is a hug and an autograph to sell our dignity, and the dignity of fellow LGBT people down the river--oh yeah, that's all it took, read the whole post people.                      Jennifer  |  December 22, 2008  4:17 PM Reply to this comment                               I feel obliged to point out that if you visit Tammy's blog, you'll see that she's  not  a big fan of making nice with Warren.  I believe the word she used to describe him was ""Dick.""    I added her blog to my RSS feed.  She's rather spunky and funny in her writing.                      Bil Browning  |  December 22, 2008  4:26 PM Reply to this comment                               Do Obama and Etheridge know that we can't all meet the man? And he could just be putting on a mask for them.    This post gives me a headache. If Warren is such a great intelligent guy he  KNOWS  that civil marriage is different from religious marriage. And Tammy's analogy of caps and yarmulkes  should  be referring to the differences between civil and religious marriage, not civil marriage and civil unions.                  Eric |  December 22, 2008  4:39 PM Reply to this comment                               So did Melissa get Warren to dump the language on his SaddlebackFamily.com website concerning gays?   This page:   http://www.saddlebackfamily.com/membership/group_finder/faqs_smallgroup.asp?id=7509  Which said, among other things:   Because membership in a church is an outgrowth of accepting the Lordship and leadership of Jesus in ones life,  someone unwilling to repent of their homosexual lifestyle would not be accepted as a member at Saddleback Church . That does not mean they cannot attend church  we hope they do! Gods Word has the power to change our lives.  Is no longer on the site.                      Lynn David |  December 23, 2008  1:45 AM Reply to this comment                               I feel pretty betrayed by this, actually. Melissa Etheridge is, of course, entitled to her own personal opinion (as is Warren), but to presume to tell the LGBTQ community to not be angry with Warren and reach out  to him  is insulting to my intelligence, integrity and sense of personal dignity. Etheridge admits herself that she knew very little about Warren before the inauguration kerfuffle, but yet she feels she now has the authority to say he's just been misunderstood and actually ""loves"" gays and believes in equal rights for LGBTQ folks? Highly doubtful. I think he flattered her and now can use her as his token gay ""friend"" (as in, ""I'm not a bigot. Look I have gay friends,"" and we all know that when you say that you really must not be a bigot, when you need to qualify it like that). Argh.                  fourthwave  |  December 23, 2008 10:16 PM Reply to this comment                                           Leave a comment     To help avoid spam, all comments from unregistered users are held for moderation.

We have spent a long time climbing up this mountain, looking at the impossible, changing a thousand year-old paradigm. We have asked for the right to love the human of our choice, and to be protected equally under the laws of this great country. The road at times has been so bloody, and so horrible, and so disheartening. From being blamed for 9/11 and Katrina, to hateful crimes committed against us, we are battle weary. We watched as our nation took a step in the right direction, against all odds and elected Barack Obama as our next leader. Then we were jerked back into the last century as we watched our rights taken away by prop 8 in California. Still sore and angry we felt another slap in the face as the man we helped get elected seemingly invited a gay-hater to address the world at his inauguration.     I hadn't heard of Pastor Rick Warren before all of this. When I heard the news, in its neat little sound bite form that we are so accustomed to, it painted the picture for me. This Pastor Rick must surely be one hate spouting, money grabbing, bad hair televangelist like all the others. He probably has his own gay little secret bathroom stall somewhere, you know. One more hater working up his congregation to hate the gays, comparing us to pedophiles and those who commit incest, blah blah blah. Same 'ole thing. Would I be boycotting the inauguration? Would we be marching again?    Well, I have to tell you my friends, the universe has a sense of humor and indeed works in mysterious ways. As I was winding down the promotion for my Christmas album I had one more stop last night. I'd agreed to play a song I'd written with my friend Salman Ahmed, a Sufi Muslim from Pakistan. The song is called ""Ring The Bells,"" and it's a call for peace and unity in our world. We were going to perform our song for the Muslim Public Affairs Council, a group of Muslim Americans that tries to raise awareness in this country, and the world, about the majority of good, loving, Muslims. I was honored, considering some in the Muslim religion consider singing to be against God, while other Muslim countries have harsh penalties, even death for homosexuals. I felt it was a very brave gesture for them to make. I received a call the day before to inform me of the keynote speaker that night... Pastor Rick Warren. I was stunned. My fight or flight instinct took over, should I cancel? Then a calm voice inside me said, ""Are you really about peace or not?""     I told my manager to reach out to Pastor Warren and say ""In the spirit of unity I would like to talk to him."" They gave him my phone number. On the day of the conference I received a call from Pastor Rick, and before I could say anything, he told me what a fan he was. He had most of my albums from the very first one. What? This didn't sound like a gay hater, much less a preacher. He explained in very thoughtful words that as a Christian he believed in equal rights for everyone. He believed every loving relationship should have equal protection. He struggled with proposition 8 because he didn't want to see marriage redefined as anything other than between a man and a woman. He said he regretted his choice of words in his video message to his congregation about proposition 8 when he mentioned pedophiles and those who commit incest. He said that in no way, is that how he thought about gays. He invited me to his church, I invited him to my home to meet my wife and kids. He told me of his wife's struggle with breast cancer just a year before mine.     When we met later that night, he entered the room with open arms and an open heart. We agreed to build bridges to the future.      Brothers and sisters the choice is ours now. We have the world's attention. We have the capability to create change, awesome change in this world, but before we change minds we must change hearts. Sure, there are plenty of hateful people who will always hold on to their bigotry like a child to a blanket. But there are also good people out there, Christian and otherwise that are beginning to listen. They don't hate us, they fear change. Maybe in our anger, as we consider marches and boycotts, perhaps we can consider stretching out our hands. Maybe instead of marching on his church, we can show up en mass and volunteer for one of the many organizations affiliated with his church that work for HIV/AIDS causes all around the world.     Maybe if they get to know us, they wont fear us.    I know, call me a dreamer, but I feel a new era is upon us.     I will be attending the inauguration with my family, and with hope in my heart. I know we are headed in the direction of marriage equality and equal protection for all families.      Happy Holidays my friends and a Happy New Year to you.    Peace on earth, goodwill toward all men and women... and everyone in-between.

I was listening when you called her to let her know about Warren and I could feel the emotions that you were fighting with. I am so proud of you for having the courage to do the ""hard"" thing and meet with this man. He needs to understand the responsibility he has and that what he says and how he says it affects not only his followers, but all of us! But the thing that struck me about the whole thing is the fact that in your determination to do what your heart told you to do, you not only opened a door and passed through it with Warren, you performed, on stage, as a woman at a Muslim gathering and you opened more doors and hearts with that performance than many Muslim women could have hoped for. In a wonderful twist of fate you chosing to do the hard thing turned out to benefit more people than you know. You are an amazing woman, and although you don't deserve the backlash you're getting in some of these posts, I know you understand that there are millions of us cheering you on and we know that moving forward is always in small steps. Keep the faith, love and happy new year to you and your family and we look forward to seeing you at the inauguration.                                                                                                                                               Reply                                                                    Favorite                                   Flag as abusive                                                                     Posted 03:01 AM on 01/10/2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                     +                                                                                                        1of1800  See Profile   I'm a Fan of 1of1800          I'm a fan of this user                                          permalink                                                                                                                                                                                        Melissa,    As you, I am one of 1800 same sex couples who took advantage of the opportunity to be married in CA. I chose to have a confidential ceremony with no witnesses which is also not public record. My partner of 31 years and I have an ""invisible"" marriage. Why did we do it that way? Because of 31 years of living in the majority heterosexual world wherein besides our best efforts to let people ""just get to know us"", it resulted in only a few friendly neighbors and mostly not. We own our own business and home, vote and pay our taxes. We are, by all measures, productive members of society. But, Melissa, we would not have been so eager to believe Pastor Warren's epiphany which he shared with you. Remember, actions speak louder than words. Only time will tell if he really is serious about bridging our community's differences. He has a golden moment during his inaugural invocation to offer an olive branch.

Warren and his ilk cannot be trusted to change. Why is it always the group that is being oppressed is seen as the one that should turn the other check and be nice and understand and beg for understanding by the unenlightened? I am one gay person who wants Obama,  Warren and all the anti-gay, homophobic Americans to provide us not with special rights, but equal rights. Militant? Yes. Unapologetic?  Yes. I am not a second-class citizen -- I want those who choose to discriminate to show some understanding. I am tired of being treated unfairly. I demand my rights. All gays should demand their rights. I have no faith that honey will be more successful than vinegar in our quest for equal rights.                                                                                                                                               Reply                                                                    Favorite                                   Flag as abusive                                                                     Posted 10:02 PM on 01/09/2009                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -                                                                     +                                                                                                        Meesha  See Profile   I'm a Fan of Meesha          I'm a fan of this user                                          permalink                                                                                                                                                                                        A new ERA is upon us.

Fresh off his Golden Globe-nominated turn as a faux airline pilot in Steven Spielberg's cat-and-mouse caper Catch Me If You Can, the 28-year-old actor will next portray Howard Hughes in the big-budget biopic The Aviator.

With shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Cheers ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Will & Grace ,  Mad About You ,  Frasier , and  Friends , NBC dominated the ratings during the competitive Thursday night prime time timeslots.             Contents       1   Usage   2   Advertising   3   Decline   4   NBC Thursday-night lineup history   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Usage   In popular culture the phrase is most strongly associated with the network's entire Thursday night lineup, including both sitcoms and dramas, which dominated the ratings from the 1980s through late 1990s. Over the course of two decades, NBC's Thursday lineup featured such popular shows as  Hill Street Blues ,  The Cosby Show ,  Family Ties ,  Cheers ,  A Different World ,  Wings ,  Night Court ,  L.A. Law ,  Frasier ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Friends , and  Will & Grace .   However, contrary to popular belief, ""Must See TV"" originally applied to sitcoms only (dramas would normally be promoted separately), and for much of the 1990s the phrase was used several nights a week as an attempt at  brand extension . At one point in fall 1997, the brand was used five nights a week, with four sitcoms a night from Monday to Thursday, and two on Sunday. [ 1 ]  NBC itself would later adopt the more common interpretation; the 2002 retrospective,  20 Years of Must See TV , focused on NBC's overall Thursday-night dominance from 1982 onwards, and overlooked extensions such as ""Must See TV Tuesday"".   However, the popularity of NBC's ""Must See TV"" in the 1990s was not universal. Many  African American  viewers flocked to  FOX 's Thursday night line-up of  Living Single ,  New York Undercover , and  Martin . In fact, these were the three highest rated series among Black households (in this respective order) for the 1996-1997 season. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Advertising   Thursday nights are coveted by advertisers due to the large proportion of young, affluent viewers who tune in. Of particular interest, movie advertisers promote their titles to this target demographic on Thursday night, in hopes of influencing what movies they see on the following Friday night, the traditional opening night for most films outside of holiday periods. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Decline          From a promo for ""Comedy Night Done Right"" in October 2007. The image features [From Left]  Earl Hickey  (Of  My Name Is Earl ),  Michael Scott  (Of  The Office ),  John Dorian  (Of  Scrubs ) and  Liz Lemon  (Of  30 Rock ).       By the early 2000s, the ""Must See TV"" slogan had fallen by the wayside in NBC's promotions; more importantly, NBC had gone from the top-rated network on Thursday nights to second behind CBS, and eventually third behind ABC. Some of the reasons for NBC's failure in recent years on Thursdays was due to the lack of strong shows to replace staples such as  Friends ,  Frasier  and  Seinfeld . Another reason was due to the  Donald Trump  reality series  The Apprentice , which broke the traditional ""Must See TV"" line up containing four comedies and one drama when it debuted in winter 2004. However, most of the  NBC  lineup still finished in the top 20 weekly shows according to  Nielsen Media Research . [ 4 ]   Other networks' Thursday programming has also gotten increasingly stronger.  CBS  was first to break through with the Thursday-night schedule of  Survivor ,  CSI , and later  Without a Trace .  ABC  had success on Thursday nights with its hit  reality  series,  Dancing with the Stars .  In fall 2006,  Grey's Anatomy  was moved to Thursdays to counter  CSI ; ABC's lineup of  Ugly Betty  and  Grey's Anatomy  has proved successful in the 18-49-year-old demographic.   The ""Must See TV"" slogan reappeared briefly in early 2006 with the addition of two critically acclaimed and ratings-successful comedies,  My Name Is Earl  and  The Office . This was an attempt to re-establish a four-sitcom block after the rise and fall of  The Apprentice , which was moved to Monday nights.   In November 2006, NBC rebranded the Thursday format with a new different slogan, ""Comedy Night Done Right"", and added  Scrubs  and  30 Rock  to the lineup, forming an entire lineup without  laugh tracks  or the  multiple-camera setup  typical of past Must See TV comedies.

And I was reminded of why that show set everyone on their ear 14 years ago. Why the so-called ""war of the hospital shows"" turned quickly into a rout, with ""ER"" becoming the No. 1 show in television and ""Chicago Hope"" turning into a soap opera occasionally punctuated by Mandy Patinkin bursting into song.                        As I stood in the trauma unit of County General Hospital on the Warner studio lot, and as I reflected on the battered drop ceiling and screened flourescent lighting and carefully arranged hospital gear and bedding, I was reminded of nothing so much as my one night in a real-life Chicago emergency room; of a bright-eyed young M.D. walking in and doing instant triage with a dozen or so of us arranged in a semi-circle; of waiting my turn on a gurney that smelled of pee while the guy with the bloody gauze around his head and other injured souls took precedence over my  bread-knife wound; and of realizing there is nothing more democratic in this country than trauma care (this was before I knew anything about the uninsured).    ""ER"" was a revelation. The doctors on the show were handsome, and they inevitably fell in and out of love with each other, and they saved lives and all those things TV docs are supposed to do. But they also seemed like real doctors in the way they responded to each new case that came bursting into their sanctuary of work. That's why I was pleased to learn recently that Anthony Edwards, whose Dr Mark Greene tried never to let his emotions show, whose competence felt hard-earned and not given to him by the script gods, will make an appearance this season. (To those partial to Noah Wyle, you already know he is coming back because you saw the commercial all summer.)    Even through the hostage dramas and multiple explosions (including the one that ended season 14 in a cliffhanger) and other absurdities, ""ER"" never stopped trying to recreate the authenticity of being a patient, sick and fearful in a room full of strangers; or of being a doctor, being professional under fire, sardonically swapping stories with colleagues, dealing with incompetent and malicious higher-ups and doing things to kill the pain of not saving the world.    In a way, though, ""ER"" got stuck in the era of '90s television that it dominated. With rare exceptions (like the episode where Ray Liotta played a dying alcoholic), its patient seemed less true-to-life, the situations more outlandish, the doctors more like TV doctors.     TV shows became more complex and ambitious. ""ER"" was supplanted as the top-rated medical drama by ""House,"" a show that combines a disease whodunit of the week with a preternaturally smart solver who has the pathologies of any 10 doctors on ""ER"" combined. (Tellingly, an ""ER"" last April smacked of a ""House"" ripoff, with a hidden secret revealing a moral dilemma linked to a fatal ailment.)    And then there was reality TV. From ""Trauma in the ER"" to this summer's surprise hit ""Hopkins,"" lightweight cameras and microphones have allowed TV crews to document all the drama and emotion of actual ERs without those pesky writers and actors. The ratings for reality medical shows can't match ""ER"" at its peak, but then again, what show ever will? The point is, the realism of these unscripted shows made the scripted one  seem contrived and hokey.    ""ER's"" strong suit remains the romance of medics under fire, such as the darling attraction of opposites Tony (John Stamos) and Sam (Linda Cardellini). Cast changes will continue, with the arrival of Angela Bassett as a tough-minded administrator (Courtney B. Vance will play her husband) adding even more interest to what will likely be a parade of guest appearances by ""ER"" alumni all season long.    And truth be told, its ratings are doing just fine.  That's not what killed ""ER.""  It's suffering from the chronic problems of an old TV show: bloated production costs and a lack of attention. (More than one person, on hearing I was working on this story, said, ""'ER' is still on the air?"") The show's executive producer John Wells, sitting in a director's chair on the set, told me that NBC is paying three and a half times for his show what it would be paying for a new seris.  So even if two out of three of the new ones flopped, the network's still ahead if it gets rid of ""ER.""     And yet, said the producer of ""Third Watch"" and ""West Wing,"" ""I've never had a show cancelled where the network didn't come back a year later and say, 'We shouldn't have cancelled that show.'""

That show gave NBC its only saving grace on Friday nights and was still doing all right ratings wise when nbc decided to call it a day. at least they got to make a satisfying finale though. ah i always liked that show. it was better acted then it was ever given credit for being.

""You know, I have yet to meet a person who says they wish they spent less time with their kids when they were younger,"" says Edwards, who nonetheless will make one final appearance on  ER  Thursday (Nov. 13) as part of the NBC show's farewell season. ""And I'm really lucky that I have that opportunity. So it's going to be a few more years before my kids are really, really sick of me and want me gone. So when I get the final, 'You really have to go back to work,' then my mind will be a little more open to that.""    For now, though, Edwards has a production deal at CBS -- where he's developing a script with  30 Rock   writer Jack Burditt -- the occasional film role (most recently in last year's  Zodiac ) and dad duties with his four kids, ranging in age from 6 to 14, to keep him busy. ""I've been working as an actor since I was 16, so when I hit 40, I was OK about leaving and not doing as much for a while,"" he says. ""I didn't have that, 'What's the next movie?' [impulse] that I'd had for 24 years before, you know? So that was part of it. I think hopefully a little maturity and some moolah.""    Edwards has also thrown himself into philanthropic work since leaving  ER . He's currently working with a group called  Shoe4Africa  to help build a 250-bed children's hospital in Kenya, and he says part of his motivation for appearing in the episode was the chance to promote the cause.     He's also putting his money where his mouth is. Instead of being paid for his guest spot, Edwards asked  ER  producer Warner Bros. to donate $125,000 to the charity, which has since snowballed: ""Steven Spielberg found out about [it] and he matched, and [ ER  executive producer] John Wells kicked in $50,000,"" he says.      As for Thursday's episode, Edwards appears in a series of flashbacks that connect County General's newest attending physician, Dr. Cate Banfield ( Angela Bassett ) with Mark Greene's time. The scenes are set near the end of Greene's time at the hospital -- when he's undergoing treatment for the cancer that eventually caused his death -- and feature several other former  ER  regulars as well (whose identities we won't spoil here).    ""After about half an hour it really felt like I'd never left,"" Edwards says. ""The same conversations were happening that were happening six years ago, the same dynamics between the crew members, the same jokes. And they had gone to great effort to make it look like it did [six years ago] -- you know, when I look at the show now I see how different the ER looks than when I was on it. And they went to great effort to have all the props, everything back to 2002. So it was really -- I had a really great four days there.""    More from Edwards about his  ER  swan song:    On the decision to return:  ""It sounds kind of silly, but I mean, I really did have eight really good years on the show, and so much of that is about trust. And I'd had 180 episodes of trust, knowing that they were going to do interesting stories, and they always did.    ""So I really wasn't -- I knew they would take care of him and take care of it. ... It's a funny thing. You feel as an actor that you own the character, but the truth is so do the writers. The writers really feel an ownership of Greene, so they want to do right for him. So there's actually more people looking out for you than yourself in the end.""    On the ease of revisiting the character:  ""When you do a series and you do television like that for so many years, so much of the character is similar to yourself. Writers pick up on things that you do that they add to the character. So, you know, I'm not as -- I'll never be as smart as Dr. Greene, but there's a lot of familiarity in who he is.    ""So I think that bottom line thing that I always cared the most about him was there, which is that he really loved being a doctor. That's not a hard thing to jump back into.""    On  ER 's place in television history:  ""I think it's one of those  Gunsmoke s of TV. ... In its heyday, the numbers and the world that it had.     ""I just was in my attic the other day and had all these boxes that had been sent to L.A., and it was full of all these covers of -- magazine covers and things, a ton. And you forget -- [it was] like, Wow, there was a time when we were on the cover of  Newsweek . And so, you know, hopefully you'll think of it as  M*A*S*H . That would be the perfect thing.""    Are you excited to see Edwards return to the  ER ? Which other former cast members do you want to see return?                 in                     ER                       ,                 Interviews                                Permalink     Comments (10)                     Comments               I can't wait to see Dr. Greene back. I'd love to see his wife Dr. Corday back too, but I heard there is bad blood with the producers. Carter's coming back at some point, so I guess Dr. Chen, and Dr. Pratt would be great to see.     Alan | Nov 11, 2008 1:40:22 PM |  #                  There was a time that ER was my favorite show.  After a time, I was getting closer and closer to letting the show go, and the death of Dr. Greene was the natural end of the series for me.  I haven't watched an episode since.  I probably will watch this one, however, since Dr. Greene is back, and I missed the show for the first time in a long time when I heard the news that Michael Crichton died.  It will be like a nice memory shared one last time and a proper way to acknowledge everything the show did mean to me at one point even though I haven't paid attention to it in quite some time.      Josh Man  | Nov 11, 2008 2:09:14 PM |  #                  ER was one of the best--at one time.  Anthony Edwards was in my opinion( with Noah Wylie)the true stars of the show and after that powerful episode in which Dr. Greene eventually succumbed to his cancer it was almost like the beginning of the end for the show.  Then when Dr. Carter finally left it really should have concluded.  There have been some good, even some very good episodes since then with Pratt, Morris, Abby and others doing a decent job.  BUT....it really was not the same after Edwards and Carter and even Ross and Hathaway and Benton left.  I do like how they are bringing back most of the earlier characters though.     G | Nov 11, 2008 11:20:00 PM |  #                  I was a recurring extra on the show back in the 90s when most of the original cast was still there. Tony is truly a class act and it's great to see him back.     When ER debuted in 1994 I was a Sophomore in High School. Now I'm 31 and have a career. I've always been a fan of the show and I can say that I've seen every episode from day 1. There have been some middle of the road episodes and some bumps in the road. You can't expect that there wouldn't be for a show that has run 15 seasons.     What I love about the show is that it has always stayed true to what it is: A medical drama driven by stories and the characters who tell them.     One of my first ""real"" jobs out of college was working as a computer tech in a hospital. One of the things ER has so accurately represented over the years is its portrayal of a real hospital. I know this evolved out of actor's contracts and schedule changes, but I found that much like the TV ER, Nurses are the constant, some working there for over 20 years, while all the doctors come and go.     I am sad to see ER go. Grey's Anatomy can only hope to be half the show ER was.      Soul Reaper | Nov 12, 2008 12:33:45 AM |  #                  I want to rub myself all over Dr. Green. Deelicious!     Mel | Nov 12, 2008 7:19:22 AM |  #                  I finally gave up on ER during the season following Noah Wyle's Doctor Carter's departure from the show.  Without his presence grounding things back to the days of greatness I remembered, I no longer cared about it.  It's characters had become very card board and very boring and uninteresting.  AE's return as Dr. Greene will see me watch once again for the first time since the shows true series finale, when Wyle/Carter left the show.  I might tune in for the series finale as well, but doubt it will be as good as seeing Greene again.  The show should have been canceled years ago, I fear.  I said such years ago as well.  Not every show has the Law & Order ability to survive the cast transitions it's endured.  Even the original Law & Order almost died these past few years from it, only last year with a 13-episode half-season reviving itself (finally) once more.  It's often better to go out on top than to wait and fizzle away.     Doug | Nov 12, 2008 8:45:40 AM |  #                  Hey Doug...L&O had a full season last year (18 eps due to the writer's strike)...just an fyi     Deep Throat | Nov 13, 2008 12:10:32 AM |  #                  I am soooooooooo excited about Dr. Greene being back on ER tonight.  I've stayed with ER thru the years even after the original characters had all gone.  They did what a lot of shows don't do when introducing new characters...they would show them with the veteran characters for a long enough time to make us care about them so when a vet left, it wasn't so jarring.  It has changed a lot, but it's still a good show & worth watching.  I usually record it & watch it later, but I think I'll watch it live tonight.     DG | Nov 13, 2008 5:00:55 AM |  #                  I will miss ER so much. It's been my favourite show for so long now. To all of the people that quit watching after ""this one"" or ""that one"" left, you have missed so much good tv! The characters have changed over time, but the drama and story lines have continued to be the best on tv! I will truly miss it!     Dizzy | Nov 13, 2008 10:54:41 AM |  #                  I will also miss ER a lot when it is gone.  Yes, I'd gotten attached to different characters, but others came in that brought a different dimension to the show.  As much as I loved some of the departed characters, I think the series would have gotten stale if all the same people had been there the entire run.    I've watched the episode with Anthony Edwards in the flashbacks as Dr. Greene, and I have to say that in my opinion it was excellent.  And I liked it that Eriq La Salle (Dr. Benton) was the one who did the intro about the death of Michael Crichton.  When I saw that I was wondering if Dr. Benton was going to be one of the cameos in the show, but he wasn't.

With shows such as  The Cosby Show ,  Cheers ,  Seinfeld ,  ER ,  Will & Grace ,  Mad About You ,  Frasier , and  Friends , NBC dominated the ratings during the competitive Thursday night prime time timeslots.             Contents       1   Usage   2   Advertising   3   Decline   4   NBC Thursday-night lineup history   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Usage   In popular culture the phrase is most strongly associated with the network's entire Thursday night lineup, including both sitcoms and dramas, which dominated the ratings from the 1980s through late 1990s. Over the course of two decades, NBC's Thursday lineup featured such popular shows as  Friends ,  Hill Street Blues ,  The Cosby Show ,  Family Ties ,  Cheers ,  A Different World ,  Wings ,  Night Court ,  L.A. Law ,  Frasier ,  Seinfeld ,  ER  and  Will & Grace .   However, contrary to popular belief, ""Must See TV"" originally applied to sitcoms only (dramas would normally be promoted separately), and for much of the 1990s the phrase was used several nights a week as an attempt at  brand extension . At one point in fall 1997, the brand was used five nights a week, with four sitcoms a night from Monday to Thursday, and two on Sunday. [ 1 ]  NBC itself would later adopt the more common interpretation; the 2002 retrospective,  20 Years of Must See TV , focused on NBC's overall Thursday-night dominance from 1982 onwards, and overlooked extensions such as ""Must See TV Tuesday"".   However, the popularity of NBC's ""Must See TV"" in the 1990s was not universal. Many  African American  viewers flocked to  FOX 's Thursday night line-up of  Living Single ,  New York Undercover , and  Martin . In fact, these were the three highest rated series among Black households (in this respective order) for the 1996-1997 season. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Advertising   Thursday nights are coveted by advertisers due to the large proportion of young, affluent viewers who tune in. Of particular interest, movie advertisers promote their titles to this target demographic on Thursday night, in hopes of influencing what movies they see on the following Friday night, the traditional opening night for most films outside of holiday periods. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Decline          From a promo for ""Comedy Night Done Right"" in October 2007. The image features [From Left]  Earl Hickey  (Of  My Name Is Earl ),  Michael Scott  (Of  The Office ),  John Dorian  (Of  Scrubs ) and  Liz Lemon  (Of  30 Rock ).       By the early 2000s, the ""Must See TV"" slogan had fallen by the wayside in NBC's promotions; more importantly, NBC had gone from the top-rated network on Thursday nights to second behind CBS, and eventually third behind ABC. Some of the reasons for NBC's failure in recent years on Thursdays was due to the lack of strong shows to replace staples such as  Friends ,  Frasier  and  Seinfeld . Another reason was due to the  Donald Trump  reality series  The Apprentice , which broke the traditional ""Must See TV"" line up containing four comedies and one drama when it debuted in winter 2004. However, most of the  NBC  lineup still finished in the top 20 weekly shows according to  Nielsen Media Research . [ 4 ]   Other networks' Thursday programming has also gotten increasingly stronger.  CBS  was first to break through with the Thursday-night schedule of  Survivor ,  CSI , and later  Without a Trace .  ABC  had success on Thursday nights with its hit  reality  series,  Dancing with the Stars .  In fall 2006,  Grey's Anatomy  was moved to Thursdays to counter  CSI ; ABC's lineup of  Ugly Betty  and  Grey's Anatomy  has proved successful in the 18-49-year-old demographic.   The ""Must See TV"" slogan reappeared briefly in early 2006 with the addition of two critically acclaimed and ratings-successful comedies,  My Name Is Earl  and  The Office . This was an attempt to re-establish a four-sitcom block after the rise and fall of  The Apprentice , which was moved to Monday nights.   In November 2006, NBC rebranded the Thursday format with a new different slogan, ""Comedy Night Done Right"", and added  Scrubs  and  30 Rock  to the lineup, forming an entire lineup without  laugh tracks  or the  multiple-camera setup  typical of past Must See TV comedies.
