A day to remember all they have given us,  each day, and throughout every year.  When I think about you on this day,  my heart misses you so very much.  I miss the love only a Mother can give,  with her gentle, and caring touch.  But I do know that even in Heaven,  God remembers the Mothers He called home.  And He will bless you for all you gave,  before returning to the kingdom of His throne.  So as you celebrate Mother's Day in Heaven,  know you are loved by your children this day.  As the love for a mother is a very special love,  which nothing, or time, can ever take away.  Yet I don't need Mother's Day to remind me,  of all the love I hold so deeply in my heart.  Not a day has past when I don't think of you,  since the Angels came, and we had to part.  Today I am sending my love up to Heaven,  to you my precious Mother, on Angels' wings.  And I give thanks for everything you gave me,  as a Mother's love is one of life's true blessings.

Author Unknown        ""A  Child's  Love""    You have given to me the precious gift of life,  and a wonderful place for me to call my home.  But most of all, you have freely given to me,  the greatest unconditional love, I've ever known.  I feel blessed having been born out of your love;  for you wanting me, without knowing who I'd be.  And now you know who I am, not a day has past,  when I have ever felt that you did not want me.  Without me ever needing to ask for it from you,  you've always been right here for me over the years.  Sharing in so many smiles, as you have felt my joy,  and comforting me in sorrow, wiping away my tears.  You have taught me so much over the many years;  some I was too young to remember, but lots I do.  But those not remembered, are still part of me,  and I've become who I am today, because of you.  Although I am ""my own person"", an individual,  I'm thankful that so much of you lives inside me.  If I'd been able to choose my own personality traits,  it would have been yours, that I wanted them to be.  I just want you to know how much I do love you,  and have appreciated everything you have ever done.  I could not have asked for a more special parent,  as in my heart, you will forever be,  my number ONE!

Teach me to understand my children,  to listen patiently to what they have to say,  and to answer all their questions kindly.  Keep me from interrupting them or contradicting them.  Make me as courteous to them as I would have them be to me.  Forbid that I should ever laugh at their mistakes,  or resort to shame or ridicule when they displease me.  May I never punish them for my own selfish  satisfaction or to show my power.  Let me not tempt my child to lie or steal.  And guide me hour by hour that I may demonstrate by all  I say and do that honesty produces happiness.  Reduce, I pray, the meanness in me.  And when I am out of sorts, help me, O Lord, to hold my tongue.  May I be ever mindful that my children are children  and I should not expect of them the judgment of adults.  Let me not rob them of the opportunity to wait  on themselves and to make decisions.  Bless me with the bigness to grant them all their reasonable requests,  and the courage to deny them privileges I know will do them harm.  Make me fair and just and kind.  And make me fit, O Lord, to be loved  and respected and imitated by my children.  AMEN  Author Unknown         A Song From Heaven    In the last months of my Mothers life, she would slip in  and out of a worldnown only to her.  When she was in ""Her World"", we would all try to reach her,  to try and draw her back to us. But we had no control.  So we lived for the clear days, when she was in ""Our World"".  On one of those clear days, Mother drew me to her  bedside, and lookingnto my face she said,  "" Mum came to me yesterday.""  I can tell you I was not prepared for the words my Mother  spoke,ut as she told me of the visit, I listened,  daring not to speak. ""Mum was trying to teach me  something,"" she said, "" It was like a dream,ut more real.  I understood clearly what she was saying.""BR>  Mother paused, then looked deeply into my eyes.  ""Mum sang an old songhat she used to sing while she went  about her work in theitchen. I had forgotten that song.  I wish I had the words.""  I caught my breath and asked her the name of the song.  She didn't knowhe name, but she sang me the chorus,  struggling to recall the words.  "" Far away, beyond the starry night,"" my Mother sang.  I sensed themportance of the song and hung on every word.  Before I lefthat day, I promised to look for the words.  I looked everywhere, but not knowing the title and it  being suchn old song, I didn't have any luck.  My Mother's birthday was fast approaching, and I knew  that this songould be the perfect gift. I had all  but given up, when one day, as Ias listening to a  ""talk radio "" show, I decided to appeal to the goodBR> people in Arkansas. I called in and told them about my Mother'sBR> desire and I gave them what I had of the song.  Before the afternoon was done, I not only had the words  to Mother's song, had the music and a tape.  The folks that made the tape for me, filled the rest of  the tape with songs about Mothers. And not one ofhose  beautiful people would take a dime for the time spent.  Oh what a birthday that was. I popped that tape into  Mother's playernd watched, as her face flooded  with tears of joy. Mother played thatong so much,  that before long, we both had it committed to memory.  Little did I know what an important roll that song  wouldlay in months to come.  Soon, Mother slipped into ""Her World"", and nothing we  could doould draw her back to ours. We knew the end was near.  Before her health failed, Mother had crocheted everyone a  beautifulfghan, except for my younger sister.  I recall her asking me what colourshe should make Donna's  afghan. I told her I would find out, but whenother  became ill, we all forgot about the afghan...  all that is,xcept Mother.  There in her hospital bed, away in her world, she  would sit for hours,orking in a strained position  on an imaginary afghan. I tried inain to pull her  back to us. I would beg her to lay down her ""yarn""  and rest,ut she would take on that determined look  that I knew so well,ull away and continue working.  One day, as I watched her work with her imaginary yarn,  I decided to go to Mother instead of trying to pull her  back to me. admired her afghan and the pretty colours.  She smiled!She had ""Heard"" me.  I asked her who the afghan was for, and in broken speech  she said,My girl."" I promised her that when she finished,  I would see that Donna got that beautiful afghan.  Then I started to sing her song.  ""Twilight is stealing over the sea.""  An amazing thing happened. Mother stopped her crocheting  and egan to sing. She only hit every other word or so,  but oh those words ere precious to me. As I started  to sing the chorus, became aware of a bird singing  outside the window. walked to the window as I sang,  and there, perched on theement ledge of the 4th floor  window, was a red and brown finch,inging his heart out!  What a sight we were that day. Mother and I andhat  little bird,inging at the top of our lungs!  One month latter, I was listening to the  tape at my Mother's funeral.  nd I could almost hear her... singing along.  I will always believe that God sent me and Mother  that song.As for that little bird... well...  he must have been an Angel... sento put a song  in our hearts at a time when we needed it the most.  Bobby Smith        ""A  Mothers  Love""    l have watched you grow up over the years,  and shared in the learning, the joys and the tears.  l've seen you become the person who you are today,  A child of mine, and so very special to me, in every way.

Your hands love without end,  Gently tend the fevered brow,  until the morning comes again.  No other hands will ever feel  the same as a mother's touch,  No others hands love truer,  none could ever care so much.  Your hands will show the way  on the wings of mother's prayers,  They'll find the grace to grow each day.  Your hands love faithfully,  They're a picture of the love  of God and Jesus, they can see.  Written by  -  Lisa JohnsonBR>         A Touch of Love    You were six months old and full of fun,  With the blink of an eye, you were suddenly one.  There were so many things we were going to do,  But I turned my head, and you turned two.  At two you were very dependent on me,  But independence took over when you turned three.  Your third birthday, another year I tried to ignore.  But when I lit the candles there weren't three, but four.  Four was the year that you really strived,  Why, look at you now, you're already five.  Now you are ready for books and for rules.  This is the year that you go to school.  The big day came, you were anxious to go.  We walked to the bus, going oh, so slow.  As you climbed aboard and waved goodbye,  I felt a lump in my throat and tears stung my eyes.  Time goes so fast, it's hard to believe  That just yesterday you were home here with me.  And tomorrow when the bus brings you home  and you jump to the ground,  You'll be wearing your cap and graduation gown.  So, I'm holding to these moments as hard as I can,  Because the next time I look, I'll be seeing a man.  Author Unknown         Walking With Grandma    I like to walk with Grandma,  Her steps are short like mine.  She doesn't say ""Now hurry up.""  She always takes her time.  I like to walk with Grandma,  Her eyes see things like mine do...  Wee pebbles bright, a funny cloud,  Half hidden drops of dew.  Most people have to hurry,  They do not stop and see...  I'm glad that God made Grandma,  Unrushed and young like me!  Author Unknown         No Charge    My little boy came into the kitchen this evening  while I was fixing supper.  And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on.  So, after wiping my hands on my apron, I read it,  and this is what it said:   For mowing the grass, $5.  For making my own bed this week, $1.  For going to the store $.50.  For playing with baby brother while you  went shopping, $.25.  For taking out the trash, $1.  For getting a good report card, $5.  And for raking the yard, $2.   Well, I looked at him standing there expectantly,  and a thousand memories flashed through my mind.  So, I picked up the paper, and turning it over,  this is what I wrote:   For the nine months I carried you,rowing  inside me, No Charge.  For the nights I sat up with you,octored you  prayed for you, No charge.  For the time and the tears,nd the cost  through the years, No Charge.  For the nights filled with dread,nd the  worries ahead, No Charge.  For advice and the knowledge,nd the cost of  your college, No Charge.  For the toys, food and clothes,nd for  wiping your nose, No Charge.  Son, when you add it all up,he full cost  of my love is No Charge.   Well, when he finished reading, he had greatBR> big tears in his eyes.  And he looked up at me and he said,  ""Mama, I sure do love you.""BR> Then he took the pen and in great big letters he wrote,  ""Paid In Full""  Written by - Shirley Caesar  These words were put to music, one of my all time favourite songs.      When God Created Mothers    When the good Lord was creating mothers, He was into  His sixth day of overtime, when an angel appeared and said,   ""You're doing a lot of fiddling around on this one.  "" And the Lord said, ""Have you read the spec on this one?  She has to be completely washable, but not plastic;  have 180 moveable parts, all replaceable; run on  black coffee and leftovers; have a lap that disappears  when she stands up; A kiss that can cure anything from  a broken leg to a disappointed love affair; and six pair of hands.""  The angel shook her head slowly and said,  ""Six pairs of hands...no way.  It's not the hands that are causing me problems,""  said the Lord.  ""It's the three pairs of eyes that  Mothers have to have.""  ""That's on the standard model?"" asked the angel.  The Lord nodded. ""One pair that sees through closed doors  when she asks, ""What are you kids doing in there?""  when she already knows. Another here, in the back  of her head that sees what she shouldn't, but  what she has to know, and of course the ones here  in front that can look at a child when he goofs up  and say, ""I understand and I love you,"" without  so much as uttering a word.""  ""Lord,"" said the angel, touching his sleeve gently,  ""Rest for now. Tomorrow.....""  ""I can't,"" said the Lord. ""I'm so close to creating  something close to myself. Already I have one who  heals herself when she is sick, can feed a family  of six on one kilo of hamburger mince and can  get a nine year old to stand under a shower.  The angel circled the model of the Mother very slowly.  ""She's too soft,"" she sighed.  ""But tough!"" said the Lord excitedly.  ""You cannot imagine what the mother can do or endure.  ""Can she think?""  ""Not only think, but she can reason and compromise,""  said the Creator.  Finally the angel bent over and ran her finger across the cheek.  ""There's a leak,"" she pronounced. ""I told you, you were  trying to put too much into this model.""  ""It's not a leak,"" said the Lord. ""It's a tear.""  ""What's it for?""  ""It's for joy, sadness, disappointment, pain,  loneliness and pride.""  ""You're a genius,"" said the angel.  The Lord looked sombre, ""I didn't put it there.""

Walker was the daughter of slaves, married at 14, a widow with a baby daughter at 20. But, by the time that she was 40, Madam C. J. Walker (1867-1919) was making as much money as a white corporate executive, thanks to her popular hair-care products for black women and her brilliance at marketing them. She created a workforce of sales agents that gave African American women job options other than being washerwomen or domestics. As her prominence and wealth increased, she became a generous benefactor of black educational institutions, and such a staunch supporter of the anti-lynching movement that the State Department labeled her a ""race agitator"" and denied her a passport in 1919. Yet, she had plenty of time for fun, too; she built a lavish mansion (near John D. Rockefeller's) in Irvington-on-Hudson, New York, and her daughter Lelia entertained the Harlem Renaissance elite in a spectacular Manhattan townhouse that was renovated with revenues from the company's New York branch. Madam C. J. Walker as she chose to call herself after marrying Charles J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove in 1867 to former slaves. She was orphaned at age 7 when her parents died in a yellow fever epidemic. As a child she picked cotton and helped do laundry for others. After the death of her parents she lived with her sister and brother-in-law, Willie. At 14 she married Moses McWilliams ""to get a home of my own."" Three years later she had a baby girl, Lelia, and two years later she was widowed. She was a very driven person who wanted to provide well for herself and young daughter. As a child she had never been educated, so she worked during the day and went to school at night. She even saved enough money to send her daughter to college. All this before she founded her company. But it was a difficult time for blacks and it wasnât until Sarah had a dream in which a man gave her a secret formula for a hair care product that her life began to change for the better. Sarah had been experiencing hair loss herself and decided to try the formula. She found it worked wonderfully and tried it on family and friends. Everyone loved it. She began mixing her new product, Wonderful Hair Grower, in an attic and selling it door-to-door. Eventually she opened her own factory. Her daughter managed the company and Madame Walker traveled promoting and demonstrating her products.  Madam Walker had always wanted to help others and now she had the money to do so. Her employees, mostly black women, received better pay and were treated with dignity and offered opportunities for advancement. She gave money to Mary Bethuneâs school, the NAACP, many black writers and artists, churches, YMCAâs, and various charities.   At only 51 years of age, on May 25, 1919, Madam C. J.

As America's ""Family Manager,"" bestselling author Kathy Peel has shown millions of moms that running a household is like operating a business. Like any good C.E.O., every mother must know her goals, determine her strategies, and manage her human resources.       Delegate-Motivate-Organize...Relax!       Every smart manager knows that success depends on teamwork. Kathy shows readers how to get kids and spouses to help around the house-with lots of practical advice and encouragement to get them motivated and keep them going.       Save Time, Money, and Your Sanity      With hundreds of time-saving, money-saving, and stress-reducing ideas, this indispensable handbook also shows readers how to take charge of running the home-without running themselves into the ground.                                                                                                                 ,                                                          s                                           p: 10       sGU:                                :  WiseMomma  CT, USA - 2008t75           HomeManager101           Upon leaving the corporate world to nurture our first born, I came across this book. It was a very helpful tool! It gave me help I needed to transition rolls from Corp Woman to Family Manager. It helped me see myself in a new light. The term HomeMaker is so matronly and out dated. With my new title as Home Manager and new job description I was ready to tackle the days ahead with confidence. This book gives sooo much practical advice. It's like having a granny sharing all her secretes and golden nuggets to keeping a house in order all the while balancing the delicate relationships of wife, mother and friend. Written well, organized chapters by subject, meaty & written in plain english with no unnecessary fluff. It is a wonderful book and I'm so glad I got my hands on it! More than a good read, it has templates and loads of suggestive advise to getting the job done efficiently and quickly. The Family Manager Takes Charge is a must have for those seeking more sanity while running the home.                                   :  Mommie of Mollie  San Antonio, TX - 2007t87           Things I never thought to do (or never knew how)           I just got this book a few days ago, and have been reading it in my spare time, but already I've organized the office, my daughter's closet, and the kitchen cupboards with Kathy Peel's advice.  This book not only gives great tips and advice, but gets you motivated to keep a clean, organized and orderly home.  I'm only in the 4th or 5th chapter so far, and have gotten so many great ideas for keeping a more smooth-running home.  My husband has really enjoyed coming home every day to a more organized, neater home.  Our biggest problem is clutter, and she gives great advice for getting rid of clutter and controlling the influx.  We have a lot to do yet, but I'm excited to take back our home with Kathy Peel's helpful instructions.                                   :  KJK  boulder, co - 2007t410           A must for new brides!           I have been a housewife for 17 years and I still learned a lot of great time saving tips from this book.  This is definately the kind fo book you have to buy, not borrow, so you can hilight and tag pages that jump out at you.  It has columns for notes, budgets, etc.  This is an absolutely perfect book for a shower gift or anniversary gift for a new bride--I am excited to give a copy to my daughters when they leave home.                                   :  Rivka Slatkin  None - 2007t211           not the typical organizing book           A lot of organizing books repeat the same old principles. Kathy's book applies an entirely different creed! Family managers become CEOs of the family which gives us a whole different perspective and value system. I highly recommend this book. Even after you get the concept down, there is a lot of information in the book you will want to have on the shelf as a reference.                                   :  Coleen A.

All family members living in the home should help take care of the home they live in. Almost everyone can do something, even small children. There is NO reason why Mom should clean up behind herself and everyone else too! After all, if everyone is partaking of the blessings of the home to live in, everyone should help take care of it. While no one will change overnight, incorporating these tips into your daily life will soon make new and neater habits for even the messiest of the messies. If you make a mess, clean it up immediately. Don't say you will get it after a while, do it now. Once you walk away from it, chances are that you won't go back to it. Make a habit of cleaning up as you go! This saves time and keeps the home clean and organized. Washing dishes as you cook works great if you don't want a pile after the meal, fold and put away the laundry as soon as it's done, and have the kids put away toys they are done with before they take more out. If you use it, put it back where it belongs. Don't wait until later, do it immediately! Again, once you leave it, chances are you won't go back to it, and whatever you used will not be put away. Have family members learn to put things where they belong when they are done with the item.

You can set your own hours, work when you want to, be with the kids more, and you are your own boss. The perks are wonderful. But having a home business can also become overwhelming quickly when it comes to balancing work and caring for the home and family. It's important for a WAHM to be organized so that the home business and the home and family are taken care of. Being organized doesn't mean you have to do everything yourself. Enlist the rest of the family to help out. Instead of trying to run your home business and do everything around the house that needs to be done, delegate chores out to the rest of the family. This can either be done on a rotating basis where the chores change each week, or you can assign certain chores to family members that they will be responsible for on a daily or weekly basis. Almost everyone can do something. In assigning chores to be done, it's helpful to remember that the kids and hubby will no doubt not do things the way you do them. Unless something is really needing taken care of better or in a different manner, don't go behind them and redo it or complain to them. The idea is to get help so that you can work. If you go behind them, you're not getting work done.

If our homes are disorganized and cluttered, it can easily overwhelm us. Activities as simple as looking for something, trying to decide where to start cleaning, or even where to store something can overwhelm us causes unnecessary stress. Decluttering and organizing the home isn't difficult and it makes day to day life so much simpler. When you get organized, you not only have an organized home and a clutter free home, but you have better time management. This gives you more time to do things you want to do or need to do, not to mention the benefits of less stress on the mind and body. One of the first steps to getting an organized life is to declutter your home. Uncluttering the home gets rid of things that you no longer need or use. This can be clothes that you or the family no longer wear or fit into, books and toys the kids have outgrown, things that you keep that serve no purpose, papers ad magazines that have piled up over the months, etc. It it serves no useful purpose and isn't being kept for sentimental purposes, it's probably a good idea to toss it out. Once the clutter is gone, then you can begin to organize your home room by room. Everyone has a different idea of how to organize their home and belongings. The best way is to organize for how you use things. Items that you use the most obviously need to be more accessible than items that are used less often. So you will want to organize used items in a manner that they can be easily obtained when needed.

thinking back to a time when I was young,            My memory is clear as day, I'm listening to the dishes clink,            You were downstairs; you would sing songs of praise,            And all the times we laughed with you,            And all the times that you stayed true to us,            Now we say, I said, I thank you,            I'll always thank you,            More than you could know,            Than I could ever show,            And I love you, I'll always love you,            There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,            That you're beautiful forever,            You were my mom,            You were my dad,            The only thing I ever had was you, It's true,            And even when the times got hard you were there,            To let us know that we'd get through, you showed me how to be a man,            You taught me how to understand the things people do,            You showed me how to love my God,            You taught me that not everyone knows the truth,            And I thank you,            I'll always thank you,            More than you could know,            Than I could ever show,            And I love you, I'll always love you,            There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,            That you will live forever, always                                                                                I Want a Mom           (Album: Unknown; Artist: Cyndi Lauper)                       I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom who love me whatever                      I want a mom to take my hand           And make me feel like a holiday           A mom to tuck me in at night           And chase the monsters away           I         want a mom to read me stories           And sing a lullaby           And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Oh, I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom that will love me whatever, forever                      And when she says to me that she'll always be there           To watch and protect me, I don't have to be scared           O, and when she says I will always love you,            I don't need to worry cause I'll know that it's true                      I want a mom when I get lonely, to take the time to play           A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it gray           I want a mom to read me stories and sing a lullaby           And if I find a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Chorus (repeat twice):            I want a mom           I want a mom           I

Literally jumped off the page and said âread me.â Perhaps it is because I have a home office that looks like this:     Iâve tried to organize it before as you can probably see from the various boxes on the shelves, but for some reason it just didnât stick. What? It doesnât look too bad, you say? Well, thatâs because I havenât shown you the close-up view. Prepare yourself, it gets pretty bad.   Iâll start with the shelves - nothing unbearable there really. Itâs not completely organized, but at least you can see the labels on everything and theyâre easily accessible. The only problem is that there are several of these stacks lying around with no real order to them.     Okay, moving on to the other side of the desk. Here we have my perpectually over-flowing inbox. Itâs full of the papers that I can never find and that I never know what to do with once theyâre found.     And now, the other side of the desk(I saved the best for last). Consider yourself warned.     Iâm not sure how to even explain it or justify it. Especially the dog hair. Itâs embarrassing really.   This is what Iâve been living with for the past several months. So when I opened the  YOU CAN DO IT book  and saw the Getting Organized chapter heading, I realized that it was written for me and me alone.   Okay, on the off-chance that it was written for you too, Iâm going to show you what it suggests. First, let me say that this chapter is based on the advice of Meryl Starr, a professional organizer in New York. And I like how she said, âorganization doesnât just look good, it feels good.â How true!    Step 1:   Select the space you want to clean. It can be a closet, an entire room, or a cabinet. Make sure that you have an appropriate amount of time to devote to the project and that it can be done within that time frame.    For obvious reasons, I chose my office space. Itâs actually part of the den and sits in between theTV and my husbandâs computer desk. Since we live in a small house, we have to make do with the limited space we have. The shelving system is called  Elfa  and was purchased from  The Container Store  earlier this year. Itâs a great system and very easy to put in place.   Step 2:   Have your supplies that youâll need such as garbage bags and things with which to clean. Meryl suggests that you donât run out and buy a lot of cute boxes and things until you know exactly what you need.    Step 3:   Remove everything from the space that you are organizing and then clean. I took this step very literally and removed everything from my desk and shelves (except for the computer) and then dumped it onto the floor.     Then I cleaned. I mean I scrubbed those shelves until they shined.     I almost didnât want to put anything back and I probably wouldnât have either, but the CPA said I couldnât leave mypile on the floor.   Step 4:   Separate your  mess  stuff into three stacks: 1) stuff to keep, 2) stuff to donate, and 3) stuff to throw away. The object is to keep only those things that you need and to get rid of everything else. Meryl even includes a little pep talk about why it isnât necessary to keep the shell you found while walking on the beach with your first boyfriend. She said that, âyou can hang onto the memory of your first love â¦ without hanging onto the physical memories.â    So I sorted and I separated and finally came up with my three piles.   Throw away:   Donate:   Keep:         Step 5:   Now it wastime to put everything back.  Things had been pretty easy until this point but suddenly I broke out in a cold sweat. I had been down this road before and was scared to try it again. I mean, being organized isnât a thing that comes naturally for me, I have to work at it. Hard. Just as I began to wonder if it was worth the effort and maybe I should just accept a life of slothfulness, I started to get ideas in my head. Mental images of what my desk could look like.   So I ran upstairs and grabbed the tv/monitor that was sitting unused in the guest room. I hooked it up beside my computer so that it could act as my second monitor, one to be used just for working on photos. Then I followed some of Merylâs suggestions to take advantage of organizational toolssuch as divider trays, boxes for cds or photos, baskets, hooks, etc.   So I filed away the extra magazinesâ¦     and then rearranged my boxes.     I even made sure they had labels on them to help find things quickly.     I changed the layout of my books which helped to make the stacks look neater and to keepthem from constantly falling over, which was a problem I had struggled with before.     Then I made a quick trip to The Container Store for some drawers as I previously did not have any in place. I think that is the key to keeping my desk organized - having a space for the little things to go. SotheCPA and Iinstalled the three  new drawers  (which are currently on sale for half off, btw).     In the bottom drawer I stored my collection of stationery. (Some people collect stamps, others collect coins. I collect paper products.)     In the next drawer, we added an insert that provides individual spaces for things like post-it notes, pens, and chapstick.     And the top drawer is the place for my miscellaneous papers. Only this time, I have a system to use. I put in three separate containers to help keep my papers from being thrown all over the drawer.     Then, I grabbed some of these fantastic paper clips and wrote titles on them such as âfileâ     âurgent,â     and âmiscellaneous.â     Also while at The Container Store, we had picked up this great  cord organizer . You probably donât realize it, but behind that white âpipeâ is about four different cords. The idea is to try to hide them as much as possible since they can look very unsightly. Iâm still working on hiding the other cords, but itâs a start.     A few finishing touches such as the clock,     and this floating shelf (to be used for the books I am currently reading) and voila. We were done!     And now for the end result of all of our hard workâ¦     Isnât that amazing? With all the extra space that was created, I even had a place for my new scanner.    Hereâs the breakdown:   Before: After:       Before: After:      Before: After:      There you have it. Was it a lot of work? I wonât lie to you - it took me several hours, the better part of a day really.   Was it worth it?   Hmmâ¦ to go from this:     to this:     ABSOLUTELY!!   Okay, now that youâre all fired-up and ready to get going, what space are you going to organize? Do you have any suggestions or tips that work for you?

Seriously amazing. I canât wait to see it in person. It looks so great. Good job. I know that must have taken forever!                                    The Wife of Odie  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 7:32 am         P.S. $20 if youâll come do that at my house                                     Margie  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 8:11 am         Awesome. Looks so professional now. Great job.                                    Joanna  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 9:24 am         That is inspiring!!  Iâll be honest, I LOVE organizing.  One of the things I miss about being child-free is being able to tackle a project like that and not be constantly interrupted.  Iâm a huge nerd, itâs true.   I also collect stationery.  Because Iâm cool like that.                                    Kristina  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 9:24 am         First of all, I need a desk system like that. And secondly, it looks amazing! It could be in the Ikea catalog!                                    Ruth  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 11:13 am         Ahhh, the wonders and pains of organizing! Since I am a homemaker now, I should be good at itâ¦ right?  My fiancee/husband is an amazing organizer. Sometimes I can get him to help me figure a space out, then I just have to keep it that way.   I LOVE stationary too!! I love making it, finding cool and on sale stuff to buy, and using it for letters!  PS You did an amazing job!!                                    admin  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 12:29 pm         WofO- make it $50 and youâve got a deal!      Margie - why, thank you!   Joanna - I can imagine it would be hard to finish a project with little ones taking your attention.    Kristina - funny you should mention Ikea since all of the boxes were there (they look similar to the Container Store boxes but are only a fraction of the cost).  Also - the Elfa system itself, which we bought during their sale, was less than $300.00.     Ruth - a fellow stationery lover!!  Isnât it the best?  I went into a store recently thatâs going out of business and they had their Crane paper on sale for 50% off (which, as you know, never happens).  I had to stop myself at five.                                    Courtney  Says:              January 7th, 2009 at 1:49 pm         Looks GREAT!  Very impressive!                                    Melody C.  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 3:52 am         Oh, my office needs this kind of help. In my defense, I need shelves and a file cabinet of my own, not shared. In an attempt to kick start my clean up I invited my husband to move his desk into my office. Now his side of the room is VERY clean and my piles are now just taller as piles consolidated to make room. Iâm sure I will sort and organize at some point, but the real organization wonât occur until (1) I start a new job with an office away from home, and (2) I get back to the States where I can splurge in places like the Container Store!    Thanks for showing that you donât have to be Martha Stewart to actually accomplish this task!!!                                    Melody C.  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 3:53 am         upon reading your comments closer, I see you had success at Ikea. We have an Ikea not too far away (special trip, not a weekly distance!) I see an excursion in my future!!!                                    Jim @ Change Jar Savings  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 6:46 am         Great job in organizing.   The problem that most people have is they want to hold on to too much stuff. Then it becomes overwhelming to think about getting rid of something you âcherishâ. We also tend to buy more than we should.                                    Rona  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 7:50 am         wow. thatâs all i have to say. this is truly inspiring - makes me wanna tackle that poor excuse of a work area weâve got.  love the color scheme btw.                                    admin  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:53 am         Thanks Courtney!    Melody - ha ha, no Martha Stewart here!  Thatâs why I needed a book to help me.   And yes, IKEA is definitely the place to go!   Jim - I agree, thatâs the hardest part sometimes, throwing away things weâre attached to.   Rona - Good luck with your work area - you can do it!!                                    Mary  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:56 am         Oh my goodness - this looks fabulous and really looks so inviting.  What would be a good enough incentive for you to do that say in my office, craft room, kitchen????  Remember, Iâm on a limited budget hereâ¦..   Your list of âhow-toâ is great and Iâll definitely print in order to remind myself of what I need to do when I tackle my jobs.  Iâll have to be couragous and send you pics of my finished project to get your opinion of how successful Iâve been.  I know this took a great deal of time but the end product is amazing.  Well done!!!   M                                    Just Pure Lovely  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 10:31 pm         Yowzee, that looks great!  Itâs right out of the pages of a magazine, isnât it?  Iâd have thought so, anyway, if you hadnât posted photos of the progress.  Way to go!   ~ Lori   p.s. Thanks for visiting my blog earlier this week!                                    erin  Says:              January 8th, 2009 at 11:23 pm         Ohhhh I love that clock.   I am SO GLAD your book/organizer says to remove everything from the space you want to clean - I have always done that!!  My mother thinks I am nuts but it works for me.  Itâs so much easier to clean and organize an empty space than trying to work around other things that are already there but may not stay where they are.   I have to clean out/organize the closets in my sewing room and our downstairs guest bedroom - my sewing room will become our babyâs nursery and the sewing room will share with the guest bedroom.  I am not sure how I will fit it all (Iâm a bit of a fabric junkie) but Iâm sure if I create a system - other than âjust throw it in the closet and shut the doorâ - I will be able to manage everything.   Thank you for the inspiration!                                    admin  Says:              January 9th, 2009 at 5:00 am         Hi Mary - I wish I could take credit for the how-to list, itâs a good one, isnât it?   Just Pure Lovely - good to see you - love the photos on your site too!   Erin - how exciting, do you know what colors your going to be using for the nursery?  Youâll have to put up pictures so I can see!                                    Another Deb  Says:              January 11th, 2009 at 4:46 pm         I clicked here from Unclutterer and am so impressed!  The office is beautiful, and not so sterile and milimalistic as a lot of them.  This I can RELATE to!  Good job on the new system and thanks for including all of the photos.  I can never see too many before/after pics!                                    Nina  Says:              January 12th, 2009 at 9:24 am         Looks really great and is inspiring for a âoh, I must keep this article/photo/great book!â-person like me.   One thing I pondered on when reading your text and seeing the pics: One thing I read in Declutter books that certainly holds true for me is: the âMISCâ boxes and files come back to bâ¦ haunt you. They are like the zombies of decluttering.  If you ask decluttering-coaches or time-management coaches they will all point in horror at anything you file âmiscâ. It means it has no home, it has no real âproject nameâ - and it will breed and multiply.   One thing I was shown and that has worked well for me is making hanging manila folders with names for these âmiscâ-thingies. New thing - make a named folder, throw it in. Go through them every few weeks, and after a while you see patterns that can be grouped into (named) boxes. Or things you can throw out with a little time passed. I abhorred these hanging folders before. Now I have an Ikea sideboard that hides two wide drawers with the things and that I can stand next to and use as a worktop, too, for sorting stuff. Works great.

thinking back to a time when I was young,           My memory is clear as day, I'm listening to the dishes clink,           You were downstairs; you would sing songs of praise,           And all the times we laughed with you,           And all the times that you stayed true to us,           Now we say, I said, I thank you,           I'll always thank you,           More than you could know,           Than I could ever show,           And I love you, I'll always love you,           There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,           That you're beautiful forever,           You were my mom,           You were my dad,           The only thing I ever had was you, It's true,           And even when the times got hard you were there,           To let us know that we'd get through, you showed me how to be a man,           You taught me how to understand the things people do,           You showed me how to love my God,           You taught me that not everyone knows the truth,           And I thank you,           I'll always thank you,           More than you could know,           Than I could ever show,           And I love you, I'll always love you,           There's nothing I won't do to say these words to you,           That you will live forever, always                                                                                I Want a Mom           (Album: Unknown; Artist: Cyndi Lauper)                      I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom who love me whatever                      I want a mom to take my hand           And make me feel like a holiday           A mom to tuck me in at night           And chase the monsters away           I want a mom to read me stories           And sing a lullaby           And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Oh, I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom to make it all better           I want a mom that will last forever           I want a mom that will love me whatever, forever                      And when she says to me that she'll always be there           To watch and protect me, I don't have to be scared           O, and when she says I will always love you,           I don't need to worry cause I'll know that it's true                      I want a mom when I get lonely, to take the time to play           A mom who can be a friend and find a rainbow when it gray           I want a mom to read me stories and sing a lullaby           And if I find a bad dream, to hold me when I cry                      Chorus (repeat twice):           I want a mom           I want a mom           I want a mom that will last forever           I

Many songs around on love it's true,           But here's one just for you.           A faithful lass and one so nice,           From what I've seen only one vice,                      Her wee ones and her husband that's me,           The one vice in a girl so lovely.           A head turner still is she,           All her men as proud as can be.                      So Mum on the day to remember,           On you we all concur,           That indeed you are are the sum,           Of the formula that makes you the No. One Mum!

Madam C.J. Walker                First African-American Female Millionaire                1867-1919               Â                Â                                Madam C.J. Walker was a highly successful entrepreneur of the early                twentieth century and was also well known as a social activist and                philanthropist. Besides being noted as the first female African-American                millionaire, Madam Walker was renowned for her stirring political                and social advocacy and her humanitarian efforts. An early promoter                of womenâs economic independence, she provided well-paying                jobs for thousands of African-American women who otherwise would                have been employed as domestic help and manual laborers.                               Madam C.J. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on December 23, 1867                to Minerva and Owen Breedlove on the shores of the Mississippi River                in Delta, Louisiana. Her parents were ex-slaves living on the Burney                plantation in Delta and Sarah was the first child of their born                in freedom. As a child, Sarah suffered much loss. Her mother died                when she was only seven years old and though her father remarried                rather quickly he also died before she turned eight. Because her                family was poor, her educational opportunities were limited and                she received little formal education.                               When she was a mere fourteen years old, Sarah married Moses McWilliams                so that she might have a home. Making their home in Vicksburg, together                they had one daughter, AâLelia who was born in 1885. Moses                died in 1887, leaving the widowed Sarah to provide for her family.                She moved with her daughter to St. Louis, Missouri. For the next                eighteen years Sarah supported herself and her daughter by obtaining                work as a washerwoman.                               In 1905, while still living in St. Louis, Sarah had an idea to                begin a cosmetics business. She began to develop a hair care and                grooming system for African-American women that would heal scalp                disease through more frequent shampooing, massage, and an application                of her special ointment. She also devised a method for these women                to straighten their hair. Before this time African-American women                who wanted to de-kink their hair had to iron it with a flat iron                with their hair placed on a flat surface. Sarah devised a system                to straighten hair that used her hair softener with the aid of a                straightening comb.                               Encouraged by her success in St. Louis selling her cosmetics and                method, Sarah moved to Denver Colorado in July, 1905 where she was                joined by her close friend C.J. Walker, a newspaperman. They were                married six months later and though they divorced six years later,                she kept the name that became famous.                                Madam Walker sold her cosmetics and method door-to-door, giving                demonstrations to the women of Denver. She also enlisted the help                of other women hired as agent-operators to sell her products. These                women became known as âhair culturistsâ and âscalp                specialistsâ. Walker required her agents to sign a contract                binding them to a hygienic regimen and in her meetings with them                she stressed the importance of cleanliness and attractiveness as                an aid to self-respect and racial advancement.                                With others selling her method and product for her, Madam Walker                was able to concentrate her efforts on the instruction of her methods                and on the manufacture of her product line. In 1910 she built a                plant in Indianapolis, Indiana that would serve as a center of the                Walker enterprises. The company had many branches including the                Walker College of Hair Culture and Walker Manufacturing Company,                remained in business until it was sold in 1985. The Madame C.J.                Walker Manufacturing Company provided employment for over three                thousand people and Walker herself claimed that her multi-level                sales force had over 20,000 agents by 1919.                               Madam Walker was a generous donor to black charities and was active                in black philanthropic work. In fact, she made the largest single                donation to the National Association of Colored Womenâs effort                to buy the home of Frederick Douglass to be preserved as a museum.                She also contributed generously to such organizations as the Y.M.C.A.                of Indianapolis, the National Association of Colored People and                to several organizations that provided help to the needy in Indianapolis                and scholarships for young men and women at the Tuskegee Institute.                Sarah also encouraged her employees in their own community philanthropic                work, giving cash prizes to the groups of agents that did the largest                amount of community work.                               At the height of her success, Madam Walker was diagnosed with hypertension                and doctors suggested she reduce her activity level. Nevertheless,                Sarah did not heed their advice and continued her busy schedule.                She soon became ill and died on May 25, 1919 as a result of chronic                interstitial nephritis, kidney failure, and hypertension. Despite                her impoverished beginnings, Madam C.J. Walker became known as the                wealthiest African-American woman of her time and, to her credit,                she used her prominent position to fight against racial discrimination                and her substantial fortune to support civic, educational, and social                agencies to aid her fellow African-Americans.
