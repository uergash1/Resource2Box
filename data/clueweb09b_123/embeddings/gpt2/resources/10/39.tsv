It is situated on the Atlantic coast at the most easterly point of the island. Island country in the Caribbean, one of the Lesser Antilles. It is about 483 km/300 mi north of Venezuela. Government  The bicameral legislature dates from 1627, when the British settled. The constitution dates from 1966 and provides for a system of parliamentary government on the British model, with a prime minister and cabinet drawn from and responsible to the legislature, which consists of a Senate and a House of Assembly. The Senate has 21 members appointed by the governor general, 12 on the advice of the prime minister, two on the advice of the leader of the opposition, and the rest on the basis of wider consultations. The House of Assembly has 28 members elected by universal suffrage. The legislature has a maximum life of five years and may be dissolved within this period. The governor general appoints both the prime minister (on the basis of support in the House of Assembly) and the leader of the opposition. History  Originally inhabited by Arawak Indians, who were wiped out soon after the arrival of the first Europeans, Barbados became a British colony in 1627 and remained so until independence in 1966. Universal adult suffrage was introduced in 1951, and the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) won the first general election. Ministerial government was established in 1954, and BLP leader Grantley Adams became the first prime minister. A group broke away from the BLP in 1955 and formed the Democratic Labour Party (DLP). Six years later full internal self-government was achieved, and in the 1961 general election the DLP was victorious under its leader Errol Barrow. Independence  When Barbados attained full independence in 1966, Barrow became its first prime minister. The DLP was re-elected 1971, but in the 1976 general election the BLP - led now by Grantley Adams's son Tom - ended Barrow's 15-year rule. Foreign relations  Both parties were committed to maintaining free enterprise and alignment with the USA, although the DLP government established diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1972 and the BLP administration supported the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. End of two-party system  The BLP was re-elected in 1981. After Adams's sudden death in 1985 he was succeeded by his deputy, Bernard St John, a former BLP leader. In the 1986 general election the DLP, led by Barrow, was returned to power with a large majority. Errol Barrow died in 1987 and was succeeded by Erskine Lloyd Sandiford. A new opposition party, the centrist National Democratic Party, was formed in 1989. The DLP was re-elected in 1991, but in the 1994 general election the fortunes of the BLP were restored and its new leader, Owen Arthur, became prime minister. In January 1999 the BLP gained a landslide victory in the general elections, securing 26 of the 28 House of Assembly seats. How to thank TFD for its existence?

Eleven  Southern   slave states  declared their  secession  from the U.S. and formed the  Confederate States of America  (the Confederacy). Led by  Jefferson Davis , they fought against the U.S. federal government (the "" Union ""), which was supported by all the  free states  and the five  border slave states  in the north.   In the  presidential election of 1860 , the  Republican Party , led by  Abraham Lincoln , had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .   Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when  Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation  at  Fort Sumter  in  South Carolina . Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state, leading to declarations of secession by four more Southern slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a  naval blockade . In September 1862, Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation  made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander  Robert E. Lee  won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back at  Gettysburg  and, in the west, the Union gained control of the  Mississippi River  at the  Battle of Vicksburg , thereby splitting the Confederacy. Long-term Union advantages in men and material were realized in 1864 when  Ulysses S. Grant  fought  battles of attrition  against Lee as Union general  William Sherman  captured  Atlanta ,  Georgia  and  marched to the sea . Confederate resistance collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox Court House  on April 9, 1865.   The American Civil War was the deadliest war in  American history , causing 620,000 soldier deaths, and an undetermined number of civilian casualties, ending  slavery  in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the  federal government . The social, political, economic and racial  issues  of the war decisively shaped the  reconstruction era that lasted to 1877 , and brought changes that helped make America a united super power.

Lincoln  did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858  House Divided Speech , expressed a desire to ""arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction."" [ 1 ]  Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  All of the organized territories were likely to become free-soil states, which increased the Southern movement toward secession. Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand it would wither and die. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern fears that the  slave power  already controlled the government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Sectional disagreements over the  morality of slavery , the scope of democracy and the economic merits of  free labor  vs. slave  plantations  caused the  Whig  and "" Know-Nothing "" parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the  Free Soil Party  in 1848, the  Republicans  in 1854, the  Constitutional Union  in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the  Democratic Party , split along sectional lines.   Both North and South were influenced by the ideas of  Thomas Jefferson . Southerners emphasized, in connection with slavery, the  states' rights [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  ideas mentioned in Jefferson's  Kentucky Resolutions . Northerners ranging from the abolitionist  William Lloyd Garrison  to the moderate Republican leader  Abraham Lincoln [ 11 ]  emphasized Jefferson's declaration that  all men are created equal . Lincoln mentioned this proposition in his  Gettysburg Address .   Confederate Vice President  Alexander Stephens  said [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  that slavery was the chief cause of secession [ 14 ]  in his  Cornerstone Speech  shortly before the war. After Confederate defeat, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the  Lost Cause . [ 15 ]  There was a striking contrast [ 14 ] [ 16 ]  between Stephens' post-war states' rights assertion that slavery did  not  cause secession [ 15 ]  and his pre-war  Cornerstone Speech . Confederate President Jefferson Davis also switched from saying the war was caused by slavery to saying that states' rights was the cause. While Southerners often used states' rights arguments to defend slavery, sometimes roles were reversed, as when Southerners demanded national laws to defend their interests with the  Gag Rule  and the  Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 . On these issues, it was Northerners who wanted to defend the rights of their states. [ 17 ]   Almost all of the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the  three-fifths clause  and a twenty year extension of the  African slave trade  in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. There was controversy over adding the slave state of  Missouri  to the Union that led to the  Missouri Compromise  of 1820, the  Nullification Crisis  over the  Tariff of 1828  (although the tariff was low after 1846, [ 18 ]  and even the tariff issue was related to slavery), [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  the gag rule that prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 18351844, the acquisition of  Texas  as a  slave state  in 1845 and  Manifest Destiny  as an argument for gaining new territories where slavery would become an issue after the  MexicanAmerican War  (18461848), which resulted in the  Compromise of 1850 . [ 22 ]  The  Wilmot Proviso  was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from  Mexico . The extremely popular antislavery novel  Uncle Toms Cabin  (1852) by  Harriet Beecher Stowe  greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]   The 1854  Ostend Manifesto  was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex  Cuba  as a slave state. The  Second Party System  broke down after passage of the  Kansas-Nebraska Act  in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with  popular sovereignty , allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The  Bleeding Kansas  controversy over the status of slavery in the  Kansas Territory  included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery  Border Ruffians . Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents  Franklin Pierce  and  James Buchanan  to make attempts (including support for the pro-slavery  Lecompton Constitution ) to admit Kansas as a slave state. [ 25 ]  Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the  Wakarusa War , [ 26 ]  the  Sacking of Lawrence , [ 27 ]  the  caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks , [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]  the  Pottawatomie Massacre , [ 30 ]  the  Battle of Black Jack , the  Battle of Osawatomie  and the  Marais des Cygnes massacre . The 1857 Supreme Court  Dred Scott decision  allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas. The  Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858  included Northern Democratic leader  Stephen A. Douglas '  Freeport Doctrine . This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision which, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist  John Brown 's raid at  Harpers Ferry Armory  was an attempt to incite slave insurrections in 1859. [ 31 ]  The North-South split in the  Democratic Party  in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.   Other factors include sectionalism (caused by the growth of slavery in the lower South while slavery was gradually phased out in Northern states) and economic differences between North and South, although most modern historians disagree with the extreme economic determinism of historian  Charles Beard  and argue that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. [ 32 ]  There was the polarizing effect of slavery that split the largest religious denominations (the  Methodist ,  Baptist  and  Presbyterian  churches) [ 33 ]  and controversy caused by the worst cruelties of slavery (whippings, mutilations and families split apart). The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North, plus the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. [ 34 ]   The  election of Lincoln in 1860  was the final trigger for secession. [ 35 ]  Efforts at compromise, including the "" Corwin Amendment "" and the "" Crittenden Compromise "", failed.   Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North.     Slavery   Main article:  Slavery in the United States           Abraham Lincoln  16th  President of the United States  (18611865)       Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region; states of the  deep South  which had the greatest concentration of plantations were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of  Virginia ,  North Carolina ,  Arkansas , and  Tennessee  had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the  Fort Sumter  crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  As of 1850 the percentage of Southern whites living in families that owned slaves was 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union. [ 38 ]  85 percent of slaveowners who owned 100 or more slaves lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states. [ 38 ]  Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North. [ 39 ]   The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in  Dred Scott v. Sandford  added to the controversy.  Chief Justice   Roger B. Taney's  decision said that slaves were ""so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect"", [ 40 ]  and that slavery could spread into the territories. Lincoln warned that ""the next  Dred Scott  decision"" [ 41 ]  could threaten Northern states with slavery.   Northern politician  Abraham Lincoln  said, ""this question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."" [ 42 ]  The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories, [ 43 ]  and the Southern demand for a  slave code  for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that ""our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery."" [ 44 ]  Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, Southerners throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.   Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession [ 49 ] [ 50 ]  said that the non-slave-holding states were ""proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color"", and that the African race ""were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race"". Alabama secessionist E. S. Dargan warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, ""we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin."" [ 51 ]   Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S.  Postmaster General  refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South. [ 52 ]  Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. [ 53 ]  The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, ""Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests."" [ 54 ]   Over the 1850s slaves left the  border states  through sale, manumission and escape, and border states also had more free blacks and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area. Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make  Kansas  a slave state. By 1860 the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased. [ 55 ]   Even though Lincoln agreed to the  Corwin Amendment , which would have protected slavery in existing states, secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. In addition to the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as  Hinton Rowan Helper . Then slavery in the lower South, like a ""scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death."" [ 56 ]  A few secessionists mentioned the tariff issue in addition to slavery, but these were rare. Among other reasons, slavery represented much more money than the tariff. [ 56 ]   Non-slavery related causes of secession  do exist, but have little to do with tariffs or states' rights.     Secession begins           Status of the states, 1861.          States that seceded before April 15, 1861          States that seceded after April 15, 1861          Union states that permitted slavery          Union states that banned slavery          Territories               State and territory boundaries, 18645.           Union  states          Union territories           Kansas , entered Union as a free state          Union border states that permitted slavery           The Confederacy          Union territories that permitted slavery         Secession of South Carolina   South Carolina  did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state . South Carolina adopted the "" Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union "" on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the  Fugitive Slave Act , claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All of the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.     Secession winter   Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the  Confederate States of America  on February 4, 1861. [ 57 ]  They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President  James Buchanan , whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the  Dred Scott decision  was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union ""was intended to be perpetual"", but that ""the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union"" was not among the ""enumerated powers granted to Congress"". [ 58 ]  One quarter of the U.S. Armythe entire garrison in Texaswas surrendered to state forces by its commanding general,  David E. Twiggs , who then joined the Confederacy.   As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, secession later enabled Republicans to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the  Morrill Tariff , land grant colleges (the  Morill Act ), a  Homestead Act , a trans-continental railroad (the  Pacific Railway Acts ), the  National Banking Act  and the authorization of  United States Notes  by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The  Revenue Act of 1861  introduced the  income tax  to help finance the war.     The Confederacy   Main article:  Confederate States of America   Seven  Deep South  cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with  South Carolina ,  Mississippi ,  Florida ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Louisiana , and  Texas . These seven states formed the  Confederate States of America  (February 4, 1861), with  Jefferson Davis  as president, and a  governmental structure  closely modeled on the  U.S. Constitution . Following the  attack on Fort Sumter , President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy:  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  North Carolina  and  Tennessee . The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of  West Virginia  on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861,  Missouri  and  Kentucky  were divided  each of them having a pro-Southern and pro-Northern government.     The Union states   Main article:  Union (American Civil War)   Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union:  California ,  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Iowa ,  Kansas ,  Kentucky ,  Maine ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Michigan ,  Minnesota ,  Missouri ,  New Hampshire ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Ohio ,  Oregon ,  Pennsylvania ,  Rhode Island ,  Vermont , and  Wisconsin . During the war,  Nevada  and  West Virginia  joined as new states of the Union.  Tennessee  and  Louisiana  were returned to Union military control early in the war.   The territories of  Colorado ,  Dakota ,  Nebraska ,  Nevada ,  New Mexico ,  Utah , and  Washington  fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding  Native American  tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the  Indian territory  (now  Oklahoma ) a small bloody civil war.     Border states   Main article:  Border states (American Civil War)   The border states in the Union were  West Virginia  (which was separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ( Maryland ,  Delaware ,  Missouri , and  Kentucky ).   Maryland  had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union  rioting in Baltimore  and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with  martial law  and called for troops. Militia units that had been drilling in the North rushed toward Washington and Baltimore. [ 59 ]  Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland (and the separate  District of Columbia ), by arresting all the Maryland government members and holding them without trial.   In Missouri, an  elected convention  on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor  Claiborne F. Jackson  called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General  Nathaniel Lyon . After the  Camp Jackson Affair  Lyon chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ( See also:  Missouri secession ). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri. [ 60 ]   Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September, 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its loyal status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky. [ 61 ]   After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in Wheeling asked a total of 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on Oct. 24, 1861. Returns were received from 41 of the 48 counties, [ 62 ]  and a minority turnout voted heavily in favor of the new state, [ 63 ]  at first called ""Kanawha"" but later renamed ""West Virginia"", which was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863. Jefferson and Berkeley counties were annexed to the new state in late 1863. [ 64 ]  The western counties of Virginia had voted nearly 2 to 1 against secession, though 24 of the 50 counties had voted for secession. [ 65 ]  Soldier numbers from West Virginia were about evenly divided between the Confederacy and the Union. [ 66 ]   Similar Unionist secessions attempts appeared in  East Tennessee , but were suppressed by the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union and held them without trial. [ 67 ]     Overview          A  Roman Catholic  Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass       Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee. [ 68 ]  Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see  List of American Civil War battles  and  Military leadership in the American Civil War .     The war begins   For more details on this topic, see  Battle of Fort Sumter .   Lincoln's victory in the  presidential election of 1860  triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the  Confederate States of America  and established their temporary capital at  Montgomery ,  Alabama . A pre-war February  Peace Conference of 1861  met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response aside from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter via the ship  Star of the West , which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort. [ 69 ]  However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.   On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his  inaugural address , he argued that the Constitution was a  more perfect union  than the earlier  Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , that it was a binding contract, and called any secession ""legally void"". [ 70 ]  He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. [ 71 ]   The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents on the grounds that the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. [ 72 ]  However, Secretary of State William Seward engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. [ 72 ]   Fort Sumter  in Charleston, South Carolina,  Fort Monroe ,  Fort Pickens  and  Fort Taylor  were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold Fort Sumter. Under orders from Confederate President  Jefferson Davis , troops controlled by the Confederate government under  P. G. T. Beauregard  bombarded the fort with artillery on April 12, forcing the fort's capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all of the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. [ 73 ]  For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day. [ 74 ]   Liberty Arsenal  in  Liberty, Missouri  was seized eight days after Fort Sumter.   Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to  Richmond . [ 75 ]  The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of  Atlanta  and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged  Petersburg  and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.     Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861   Main articles:  Naval battles of the American Civil War ,  Union blockade , and  Confederate States Navy          1861 cartoon of Scott's "" Anaconda Plan ""       Winfield Scott , the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the  Anaconda Plan [ 76 ]  to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a  Union blockade  of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan, but overruled Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.   In May 1861, Lincoln enacted the Union blockade of all Southern ports, ending regular international shipments to the Confederacy. When violators' ships and cargoes were seized, they were sold and the proceeds given to Union sailors, but the British crews were released. By late 1861, the blockade stopped most local port-to-port traffic. The blockade shut down  King Cotton , ruining the Southern economy. British investors built small, fast "" blockade runners "" that traded arms and luxuries brought in from  Bermuda ,  Cuba  and the  Bahamas  in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco. [ 77 ]  Shortages of food and other goods triggered by the blockade, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies combined to cause  hyperinflation  and bread riots in the South. [ 78 ]   On March 8, 1862, the  Confederate Navy  waged a fight against the  Union Navy  when the  ironclad   CSS  Virginia  attacked the blockade; against wooden ships she seemed unstoppable but the next day she had to fight the new Union warship  USS  Monitor  in the  Battle of the Ironclads . [ 79 ]  The battle ended in a draw, which was a strategic victory for the Union in that the blockade was sustained. The Confederacy lost the  Virginia  when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of  Monitor . Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the  Second Battle of Fort Fisher  in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.     Eastern Theater 18611863   For more details on this topic, see  Eastern Theater of the American Civil War .          A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps       Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at  Manassas ,  Virginia , in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of  Maj. Gen.   Irvin McDowell  on the Confederate forces there was halted in the  First Battle of Bull Run , or  First Manassas , [ 80 ]  whereupon they were forced back to  Washington, D.C. , by Confederate troops under the command of Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  P. G. T. Beauregard . It was in this battle that Confederate General  Thomas Jackson  received the  nickname  of ""Stonewall"" because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. [ 81 ]  Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the  U.S. Congress  passed the  Crittenden-Johnson Resolution  on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.   Maj. Gen.  George B. McClellan  took command of the Union  Army of the Potomac  on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck ), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the  peninsula  between the  York River  and  James River , southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the  Peninsula Campaign , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]   Johnston  halted his advance at the  Battle of Seven Pines , then General  Robert E. Lee  and top subordinates  James Longstreet  and Stonewall Jackson [ 85 ]  defeated McClellan in the  Seven Days Battles  and forced his retreat. The  Northern Virginia Campaign , which included the  Second Battle of Bull Run , ended in yet another victory for the South. [ 86 ]  McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to  John Pope's  Union  Army of Virginia , which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.   Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 45,000 men of the  Army of Northern Virginia  across the  Potomac River  into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the  Battle of Antietam [ 85 ]  near  Sharpsburg ,  Maryland , on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. [ 87 ]  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his  Emancipation Proclamation . [ 88 ]          Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863       When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Ambrose Burnside . Burnside was soon defeated at the  Battle of Fredericksburg [ 89 ]  on December 13, 1862, when over twelve thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Hooker . Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the  Battle of Chancellorsville [ 90 ]  in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen.  George Meade  during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the  Battle of Gettysburg [ 91 ]  (July 1 to July 3, 1863), the bloodiest battle of the war, which is sometimes considered the war's  turning point .  Pickett's Charge  on July 3 is often recalled as the  high-water mark of the Confederacy , not just because it signaled the end of Lee's plan to pressure Washington from the north, but also because Vicksburg, Mississippi, the key stronghold to control of the Mississippi, fell the following day. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). [ 92 ]  However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.     Western Theater 18611863   For more details on this topic, see  Western Theater of the American Civil War .   While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the  Battle of Pea Ridge . [ 93 ]   Leonidas Polk 's invasion of  Columbus ,  Kentucky  ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy.  Nashville  and central  Tennessee  fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.   Most of the  Mississippi  was opened to Union traffic with the taking of  Island No. 10  and  New Madrid ,  Missouri , and then  Memphis, Tennessee . In May 1862 the  Union Navy  captured  New Orleans [ 94 ]  without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of  Vicksburg ,  Mississippi , prevented Union control of the entire river.   General  Braxton Bragg 's second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen.  Don Carlos Buell  at the  Battle of Perryville , [ 95 ]  although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at liberating Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen.  William Rosecrans  at the  Battle of Stones River [ 96 ]  in  Tennessee .   The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the  Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet 's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas . Rosecrans retreated to  Chattanooga , which Bragg then besieged.   The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was  Ulysses S. Grant , who won victories at Forts  Henry  and  Donelson  (by which the Union seized control of the  Tennessee  and  Cumberland  Rivers);  the Battle of Shiloh ; [ 97 ]  and the  Battle of Vicksburg , [ 98 ]  which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the  turning points  of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the  Third Battle of Chattanooga , [ 99 ]  driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.     Trans-Mississippi Theater 18611865   For more details on this topic, see  Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War .   Guerrilla  activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war. [ 100 ]  The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure  Missouri ,  Indian Territory ,  New Mexico Territory , and  Arizona Territory  for the Union. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico territories were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure Indian Territory succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's  Red River Campaign  was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.     End of the war 18641865           Jefferson Davis , first and only President of the  Confederate States of America       At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen.  William Tecumseh Sherman  in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of  total war  and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. [ 101 ]  This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals George Meade and  Benjamin Butler  were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond; General  Franz Sigel  (and later  Philip Sheridan ) were to  attack the Shenandoah Valley ; General Sherman was to capture  Atlanta  and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean); Generals  George Crook  and  William W. Averell  were to operate against railroad supply lines in  West Virginia ; and Maj. Gen.  Nathaniel P. Banks  was to capture  Mobile ,  Alabama .   Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (""Grant's  Overland Campaign "") of the Eastern campaign. Grant's  battles of attrition  at the  Wilderness ,  Spotsylvania , and  Cold Harbor [ 102 ]  resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back again and again. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the  Bermuda Hundred  river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks), [ 103 ]  kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the  Siege of Petersburg , where the two armies engaged in  trench warfare  for over nine months.   Grant finally found a commander, General  Philip Sheridan , aggressive enough to prevail in the  Valley Campaigns of 1864 . Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen.  Jubal A. Early  in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at  the Battle of Cedar Creek . Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the  Shenandoah Valley , [ 104 ]  a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.   Meanwhile, Sherman marched from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  John Bell Hood  along the way.  The fall of Atlanta , [ 105 ]  on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the reelection of Lincoln as president. [ 106 ]  Hood left the Atlanta area to menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the  Franklin-Nashville Campaign . [ 107 ]  Union Maj. Gen.  John M. Schofield  defeated Hood at  the Battle of Franklin , and  George H. Thomas  dealt Hood a massive defeat at  the Battle of Nashville , effectively destroying Hood's army.          A dead confederate soldier in Petersburg, Virginia 1865, photographed by  Thomas C. Roche .       Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his "" March to the Sea "". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at  Savannah ,  Georgia  in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, [ 108 ]  increasing the pressure on Lee's army.   Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the  Battle of Five Forks  on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell [ 109 ]  to the  Union XXV Corps , composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at  Sayler's Creek , it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.     Confederate Surrenders   Main article:  Conclusion of the American Civil War   Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the  McLean House  in the  village of Appomattox Court House . [ 110 ]  In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully folding the Confederacy back into the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his officer's saber and his horse,  Traveller . On April 14, 1865,  Lincoln was shot .  Andrew Johnson  became President when Lincoln died the next day.   Events leading to Lee's surrender began with the capture of key Confederate officers  Richard S. Ewell  and  Richard H. Anderson  on April 6, following Confederate defeat at the  battle of Sayler's Creek . On April 8 Union cavalry under Major General  George Armstrong Custer  destroyed three trains of Confederate supplies at  Appomattox Station , leading to the surrender of General Lee the next day. [ 111 ]  General  St. John Richardson Liddell 's army surrendered after the loss of the Confederate fortifications at the  Battle of Spanish Fort  in Alabama, also on April 9.   On April 21  John S. Mosby s raiders of the  43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry  disbanded and on April 26 General  Joseph E. Johnston  surrendered his troops to Sherman at  Bennett Place  in  Durham ,  North Carolina . Surrendering on May 4 and 5 were the Confederate departments of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana regiments and the District of the Gulf. The Confederate President was captured on May 10 and the surrender of the Department of Florida and South Georgia happened the same day. Confederate Brigadier General  ""Jeff"" Meriwether Thompson  surrendered his brigade the next day and the day following saw the surrender of the Confederate forces of North Georgia.   On June 23, 1865, at  Fort Towson  in the Choctaw Nations' area of the  Oklahoma Territory ,  Stand Watie  signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives, becoming the last Confederate general in the field to stand down. The last Confederate ship to surrender was the  CSS  Shenandoah , on November 6, 1865, in  Liverpool ,  England . These surrenders marked the  conclusion of the American Civil War .     Slavery during the war   Main article:  Slavery in the United States   At the beginning of the war some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves ""...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union."" [ 112 ]  The same Congressmanand his fellow Radical Republicansput pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. [ 113 ]   Copperheads , the  border states  and  War Democrats  opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of  total war  needed to save the Union.   In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that ""to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."" [ 114 ]  At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War  Simon Cameron  and Generals  John C. Frmont  (in Missouri) and  David Hunter  (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) in order to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.   Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. [ 115 ]  Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State  William H. Seward  told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like ""our last shriek on the retreat"". [ 116 ]  In September 1862 the  Battle of Antietam  provided this opportunity, and the subsequent  War Governors' Conference  added support for the proclamation. [ 117 ]  Lincoln had already published a letter [ 118 ]  encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was ""somehow the cause of the war"". [ 119 ]  Lincoln issued his preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation  on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that ""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."" [ 120 ]   Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. [ 121 ]  Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, [ 122 ]  which made emancipation universal and permanent.   Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves.   Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the  Fort Pillow Massacre . [ 123 ]  This led to a breakdown of the prisoner exchange program [ 124 ]  and the growth of prison camps such as  Andersonville prison  in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease. [ 125 ]   In spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As  Howell Cobb  said, ""If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong."" Confederate generals  Patrick Cleburne  and  Robert E. Lee  argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and  Jefferson Davis  was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at  Appomattox  before this plan could be implemented. [ 126 ]   The Emancipation Proclamation [ 127 ]  greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware. [ 128 ]  The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The  13th amendment , [ 129 ]  ratified December 6, 1865, finally freed the remaining slaves in Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey, that numbered 225,000 for Kentucky, 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860. [ 130 ]     Threat of international intervention   Main article:  Britain in the American Civil War   Entry into the war by Britain and France on behalf of the Confederacy would have greatly increased the South's chances of winning independence from the Union. [ 131 ]  The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State  William H. Seward  worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton.  Cotton diplomacy  proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 186062 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that ""King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton"", as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. [ 132 ]   When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons. [ 133 ]   Charles Francis Adams  proved particularly adept as  minister  to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the  CSS  Alabama , did considerable damage and led to serious  postwar disputes . However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the  Trent Affair , involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a British mail steamer to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.   In 1862, the British considered mediationthough even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S.  Lord Palmerston  reportedly read  Uncle Toms Cabin  three times [ 134 ]  when deciding on this. The Union victory in the  Battle of Antietam  caused them to delay this decision. The  Emancipation Proclamation  further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own  seizure of Mexico  ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.     Victory and aftermath   Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Southern historian  Shelby Foote  expressed this view succinctly: ""I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."" [ 135 ]  The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves and Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the  Copperheads  and their peace platform. [ 136 ]  Lincoln had also found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.   On the other hand,  James McPherson  has argued that the Norths advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory in order to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies in order to win. [ 137 ]   Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. [ 138 ]     Comparison of Union and CSA [ 139 ]       Union   CSA       Total population   22,000,000 (71%)   9,000,000 (29%)       Free population   21,567,414   5,500,000       1860 Border state slaves   432,586   NA       1860 Southern slaves   NA   3,500,000       Soldiers   2,100,000 (67%)   1,064,000 (33%)       Railroad miles   21,788 (71%)   8,838 (29%)       Manufactured items   90%   10%       Firearm production   97%   3%       Bales of cotton in 1860   Negligible   4,500,000       Bales of cotton in 1864   Negligible   300,000       Pre-war U.S. exports   30%   70%       The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the Southern population included more than 3.5 million slaves and about 5.5 million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one compared with that of the North. [ 140 ]  The disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. [ 141 ]  Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. [ 142 ]  The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially governor  Joseph E. Brown  of Georgia and governor  Zebulon Baird Vance  of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources. [ 143 ]  The Confederacy's "" King Cotton "" misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. [ 144 ]  The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, [ 145 ]  further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864-65. [ 146 ]  European  immigrants  joined the  Union Army  in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland. [ 147 ]     Reconstruction   Main article:  Reconstruction era of the United States   Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. They disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control, that should be imposed on the South and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.   Reconstruction, which began early in the war and ended in 1877, involved a complex and rapidly changing series of federal and state policies. The long-term result came in the three  Reconstruction Amendments  to the  Constitution : the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended federal legal protections equally to citizens regardless of race; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which abolished racial restrictions on voting. Reconstruction ended in the different states at different times, the last three by the  Compromise of 1877 .   For further details on how whites in the South subverted the protections of the  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth Amendments , see:     Reconstruction era of the United States [ 148 ]   Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)   African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)   Jim Crow laws   United States v. Cruikshank  (1875)   Civil Rights Cases  (1883)   Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896)   Williams v. Mississippi  (1898)   Giles v. Harris  (1903)   Redemption (United States history)       Results          Monument in honor of the  Grand Army of the Republic , organized after the war.       Slavery effectively ended in the U.S. in the spring of 1865 when the Confederate armies surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, which stipulated that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union-controlled parts of the South were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the  Thirteenth Amendment . The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as  Reconstruction . The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deathstwo-thirds by disease. [ 149 ]  The war accounted for more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined. [ 150 ]  The  causes of the war , the reasons for its outcome, and even  the name of the war itself  are subjects of lingering controversy today. About 4 million  black   slaves  were freed in 1861-65. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all  white  males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. [ 151 ]   One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of Napoleonic tactics such as charges. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels,  Mini balls  and (near the end of the war for the Union army) repeating firearms such as the  Spencer repeating rifle  and a few experimental  Gatling guns , soldiers were decimated when standing in lines in the open. This gave birth to  trench warfare , a tactic heavily used during  World War I .

Curry: The Perils and Duty of the South - Speech Delivered in Talladega, Alabama, November 26, 1860 - This was one of many Southern states' rights arguments for defending slavery.   ^  Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, ""We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'""; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia - Stephens said: 'African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization ... was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right.'   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia The larger Stephens quote, for more context, is as follows: 'The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ""storm came and the wind blew."" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.] '   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 152-153 ( Cornerstone Speech ). Stampp said Stephens' Cornerstone Speech ""was in striking contrast to his postwar constitutional interpretation.""   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 6365 ( A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States ) Stampp used the following quote to illustrate the fact that, after Confederate defeat, Stephens argued that the war was caused not by slavery but by states' rights controversies: ""It is a postulate, with many writers of this day, that the late War was the result of two opposing ideas, or principles, upon the subject of African Slavery. Between these, according to their theory, sprung the 'irrepressible conflict,' in principle, which ended in the terrible conflict in arms. Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers. That the war had its origin in opposing principles, which in their action upon the conduct of men, produced the ultimate conflict of arms, may be assumed as an unquestionable fact. But the opposing principles which produced these results in physical action were of a very different character from those assumed in the postulate. They lay in the organic Structure of the Government of the States ... between the supporters of a strictly Federative Government, on the one side, and a thoroughly National one, on the other.""   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge page 4. McPherson writes, ""After the war, however, Davis and Stephens changed their tune. By the time they wrote their histories of the Confederacy, slavery was gone with the wind -- a dead and discredited institution. To concede that the Confederacy had broken up the United States and launched a war that killed 620,000 Americans in a vain attempt to keep four million people in bondage would not confer honor on their lost cause.   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pages 3-9. Speaking of alternative explanations for secession, McPherson writes (p.7), ""While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.   ^  Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852-1857, pages 267269   ^  Freehling,  Prelude to Civil War,  page 297; Willentz page 388 - On March 13, 1833, Rhett said, ""A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands...

These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced  but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government... there is no liberty  no security for the South.""   ^  As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened: ""I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness."" - Ellis, Richard E. The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816-1836. (1965), page 257; Ellis p. 193. Ellis further notes that ""Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states rights. At various points in their careers,  John Taylor ,  John Randolph , and  Nathaniel Macon  had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners wishes.""   ^  John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union, page 197 - The author said the following about Calhoun's description of the tariff issue: ""Finally, the root of the nullification crisis was exposed. What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.""   ^  William E.

Eleven  Southern   slave states  declared their  secession  from the U.S. and formed the  Confederate States of America  (the Confederacy). Led by  Jefferson Davis , they fought against the U.S. federal government (the "" Union ""), which was supported by all the  free states  and the five  border slave states  in the north.   In the  presidential election of 1860 , the  Republican Party , led by  Abraham Lincoln , had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .   Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when  Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation  at  Fort Sumter  in  South Carolina . Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state, leading to declarations of secession by four more Southern slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a  naval blockade . In September 1862, Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation  made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander  Robert E. Lee  won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back at  Gettysburg  and, in the west, the Union gained control of the  Mississippi River  at the  Battle of Vicksburg , thereby splitting the Confederacy. Long-term Union advantages in men and material were realized in 1864 when  Ulysses S. Grant  fought  battles of attrition  against Lee as Union general  William Sherman  captured  Atlanta ,  Georgia  and  marched to the sea . Confederate resistance collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox Court House  on April 9, 1865.   The American Civil War was the deadliest war in  American history , causing 620,000 soldier deaths, and an undetermined number of civilian casualties, ending  slavery  in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the  federal government . The social, political, economic and racial  issues  of the war decisively shaped the  reconstruction era that lasted to 1877 , and brought changes that helped make America a united super power.

Lincoln  did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858  House Divided Speech , expressed a desire to ""arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction."" [ 1 ]  Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  All of the organized territories were likely to become free-soil states, which increased the Southern movement toward secession. Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand it would wither and die. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern fears that the  slave power  already controlled the government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Sectional disagreements over the  morality of slavery , the scope of democracy and the economic merits of  free labor  vs. slave  plantations  caused the  Whig  and "" Know-Nothing "" parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the  Free Soil Party  in 1848, the  Republicans  in 1854, the  Constitutional Union  in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the  Democratic Party , split along sectional lines.   Both North and South were influenced by the ideas of  Thomas Jefferson . Southerners emphasized, in connection with slavery, the  states' rights [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  ideas mentioned in Jefferson's  Kentucky Resolutions . Northerners ranging from the abolitionist  William Lloyd Garrison  to the moderate Republican leader  Abraham Lincoln [ 11 ]  emphasized Jefferson's declaration that  all men are created equal . Lincoln mentioned this proposition in his  Gettysburg Address .   Confederate Vice President  Alexander Stephens  said [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  that slavery was the chief cause of secession [ 14 ]  in his  Cornerstone Speech  shortly before the war. After Confederate defeat, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the  Lost Cause . [ 15 ]  There was a striking contrast [ 14 ] [ 16 ]  between Stephens' post-war states' rights assertion that slavery did  not  cause secession [ 15 ]  and his pre-war  Cornerstone Speech . Confederate President Jefferson Davis also switched from saying the war was caused by slavery to saying that states' rights was the cause. While Southerners often used states' rights arguments to defend slavery, sometimes roles were reversed, as when Southerners demanded national laws to defend their interests with the  Gag Rule  and the  Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 . On these issues, it was Northerners who wanted to defend the rights of their states. [ 17 ]   Almost all of the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the  three-fifths clause  and a twenty year extension of the  African slave trade  in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. There was controversy over adding the slave state of  Missouri  to the Union that led to the  Missouri Compromise  of 1820, the  Nullification Crisis  over the  Tariff of 1828  (although the tariff was low after 1846, [ 18 ]  and even the tariff issue was related to slavery), [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ]  the gag rule that prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 18351844, the acquisition of  Texas  as a  slave state  in 1845 and  Manifest Destiny  as an argument for gaining new territories where slavery would become an issue after the  MexicanAmerican War  (18461848), which resulted in the  Compromise of 1850 . [ 22 ]  The  Wilmot Proviso  was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from  Mexico . The extremely popular antislavery novel  Uncle Toms Cabin  (1852) by  Harriet Beecher Stowe  greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]   The 1854  Ostend Manifesto  was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex  Cuba  as a slave state. The  Second Party System  broke down after passage of the  Kansas-Nebraska Act  in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with  popular sovereignty , allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The  Bleeding Kansas  controversy over the status of slavery in the  Kansas Territory  included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery  Border Ruffians . Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents  Franklin Pierce  and  James Buchanan  to make attempts (including support for the pro-slavery  Lecompton Constitution ) to admit Kansas as a slave state. [ 25 ]  Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the  Wakarusa War , [ 26 ]  the  Sacking of Lawrence , [ 27 ]  the  caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks , [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]  the  Pottawatomie Massacre , [ 30 ]  the  Battle of Black Jack , the  Battle of Osawatomie  and the  Marais des Cygnes massacre . The 1857 Supreme Court  Dred Scott decision  allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas. The  Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858  included Northern Democratic leader  Stephen A. Douglas '  Freeport Doctrine . This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision which, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist  John Brown 's raid at  Harpers Ferry Armory  was an attempt to incite slave insurrections in 1859. [ 31 ]  The North-South split in the  Democratic Party  in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.   Other factors include sectionalism (caused by the growth of slavery in the lower South while slavery was gradually phased out in Northern states) and economic differences between North and South, although most modern historians disagree with the extreme economic determinism of historian  Charles Beard  and argue that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. [ 32 ]  There was the polarizing effect of slavery that split the largest religious denominations (the  Methodist ,  Baptist  and  Presbyterian  churches) [ 33 ]  and controversy caused by the worst cruelties of slavery (whippings, mutilations and families split apart). The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North, plus the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. [ 34 ]   The  election of Lincoln in 1860  was the final trigger for secession. [ 35 ]  Efforts at compromise, including the "" Corwin Amendment "" and the "" Crittenden Compromise "", failed.   Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North.     Slavery   Main article:  Slavery in the United States           Abraham Lincoln  16th  President of the United States  (18611865)       Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region; states of the  deep South  which had the greatest concentration of plantations were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of  Virginia ,  North Carolina ,  Arkansas , and  Tennessee  had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the  Fort Sumter  crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  As of 1850 the percentage of Southern whites living in families that owned slaves was 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union. [ 38 ]  85 percent of slaveowners who owned 100 or more slaves lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states. [ 38 ]  Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North. [ 39 ]   The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in  Dred Scott v. Sandford  added to the controversy.  Chief Justice   Roger B. Taney's  decision said that slaves were ""so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect"", [ 40 ]  and that slavery could spread into the territories. Lincoln warned that ""the next  Dred Scott  decision"" [ 41 ]  could threaten Northern states with slavery.   Northern politician  Abraham Lincoln  said, ""this question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."" [ 42 ]  The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories, [ 43 ]  and the Southern demand for a  slave code  for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that ""our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery."" [ 44 ]  Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, Southerners throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.   Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ]  The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession [ 49 ] [ 50 ]  said that the non-slave-holding states were ""proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color"", and that the African race ""were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race"". Alabama secessionist E. S. Dargan warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, ""we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin."" [ 51 ]   Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S.  Postmaster General  refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South. [ 52 ]  Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. [ 53 ]  The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, ""Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests."" [ 54 ]   Over the 1850s slaves left the  border states  through sale, manumission and escape, and border states also had more free blacks and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area. Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make  Kansas  a slave state. By 1860 the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased. [ 55 ]   Even though Lincoln agreed to the  Corwin Amendment , which would have protected slavery in existing states, secessionists claimed that such guarantees were meaningless. In addition to the loss of Kansas to free soil Northerners, secessionists feared that the loss of slaves in the border states would lead to emancipation, and that upper South slave states might be the next dominoes to fall. They feared that Republicans would use patronage to incite slaves and antislavery Southern whites such as  Hinton Rowan Helper . Then slavery in the lower South, like a ""scorpion encircled by fire, would sting itself to death."" [ 56 ]  A few secessionists mentioned the tariff issue in addition to slavery, but these were rare. Among other reasons, slavery represented much more money than the tariff. [ 56 ]   Non-slavery related causes of secession  do exist, but have little to do with tariffs or states' rights.     Secession begins           Status of the states, 1861.          States that seceded before April 15, 1861          States that seceded after April 15, 1861          Union states that permitted slavery          Union states that banned slavery          Territories               State and territory boundaries, 18645.           Union  states          Union territories           Kansas , entered Union as a free state          Union border states that permitted slavery           The Confederacy          Union territories that permitted slavery         Secession of South Carolina   South Carolina  did more to advance nullification and secession than any other Southern state . South Carolina adopted the "" Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union "" on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the  Fugitive Slave Act , claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All of the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.     Secession winter   Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the  Confederate States of America  on February 4, 1861. [ 57 ]  They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President  James Buchanan , whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the  Dred Scott decision  was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union ""was intended to be perpetual"", but that ""the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union"" was not among the ""enumerated powers granted to Congress"". [ 58 ]  One quarter of the U.S. Armythe entire garrison in Texaswas surrendered to state forces by its commanding general,  David E. Twiggs , who then joined the Confederacy.   As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, secession later enabled Republicans to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the  Morrill Tariff , land grant colleges (the  Morill Act ), a  Homestead Act , a trans-continental railroad (the  Pacific Railway Acts ), the  National Banking Act  and the authorization of  United States Notes  by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The  Revenue Act of 1861  introduced the  income tax  to help finance the war.     The Confederacy   Main article:  Confederate States of America   Seven  Deep South  cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with  South Carolina ,  Mississippi ,  Florida ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Louisiana , and  Texas . These seven states formed the  Confederate States of America  (February 4, 1861), with  Jefferson Davis  as president, and a  governmental structure  closely modeled on the  U.S. Constitution . Following the  attack on Fort Sumter , President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy:  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  North Carolina  and  Tennessee . The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of  West Virginia  on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861,  Missouri  and  Kentucky  were divided  each of them having a pro-Southern and pro-Northern government.     The Union states   Main article:  Union (American Civil War)   Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union:  California ,  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Iowa ,  Kansas ,  Kentucky ,  Maine ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Michigan ,  Minnesota ,  Missouri ,  New Hampshire ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Ohio ,  Oregon ,  Pennsylvania ,  Rhode Island ,  Vermont , and  Wisconsin . During the war,  Nevada  and  West Virginia  joined as new states of the Union.  Tennessee  and  Louisiana  were returned to Union military control early in the war.   The territories of  Colorado ,  Dakota ,  Nebraska ,  Nevada ,  New Mexico ,  Utah , and  Washington  fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding  Native American  tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the  Indian territory  (now  Oklahoma ) a small bloody civil war.     Border states   Main article:  Border states (American Civil War)   The border states in the Union were  West Virginia  (which was separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ( Maryland ,  Delaware ,  Missouri , and  Kentucky ).   Maryland  had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union  rioting in Baltimore  and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with  martial law  and called for troops. Militia units that had been drilling in the North rushed toward Washington and Baltimore. [ 59 ]  Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland (and the separate  District of Columbia ), by arresting all the Maryland government members and holding them without trial.   In Missouri, an  elected convention  on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor  Claiborne F. Jackson  called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General  Nathaniel Lyon . After the  Camp Jackson Affair  Lyon chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ( See also:  Missouri secession ). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri. [ 60 ]   Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September, 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its loyal status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky. [ 61 ]   After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in Wheeling asked a total of 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on Oct. 24, 1861. Returns were received from 41 of the 48 counties, [ 62 ]  and a minority turnout voted heavily in favor of the new state, [ 63 ]  at first called ""Kanawha"" but later renamed ""West Virginia"", which was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863. Jefferson and Berkeley counties were annexed to the new state in late 1863. [ 64 ]  The western counties of Virginia had voted nearly 2 to 1 against secession, though 24 of the 50 counties had voted for secession. [ 65 ]  Soldier numbers from West Virginia were about evenly divided between the Confederacy and the Union. [ 66 ]   Similar Unionist secessions attempts appeared in  East Tennessee , but were suppressed by the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union and held them without trial. [ 67 ]     Overview          A  Roman Catholic  Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass       Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee. [ 68 ]  Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see  List of American Civil War battles  and  Military leadership in the American Civil War .     The war begins   For more details on this topic, see  Battle of Fort Sumter .   Lincoln's victory in the  presidential election of 1860  triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the  Confederate States of America  and established their temporary capital at  Montgomery ,  Alabama . A pre-war February  Peace Conference of 1861  met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response aside from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter via the ship  Star of the West , which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort. [ 69 ]  However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.   On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his  inaugural address , he argued that the Constitution was a  more perfect union  than the earlier  Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , that it was a binding contract, and called any secession ""legally void"". [ 70 ]  He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. [ 71 ]   The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents on the grounds that the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. [ 72 ]  However, Secretary of State William Seward engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. [ 72 ]   Fort Sumter  in Charleston, South Carolina,  Fort Monroe ,  Fort Pickens  and  Fort Taylor  were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold Fort Sumter. Under orders from Confederate President  Jefferson Davis , troops controlled by the Confederate government under  P. G. T. Beauregard  bombarded the fort with artillery on April 12, forcing the fort's capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all of the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. [ 73 ]  For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day. [ 74 ]   Liberty Arsenal  in  Liberty, Missouri  was seized eight days after Fort Sumter.   Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to  Richmond . [ 75 ]  The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of  Atlanta  and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged  Petersburg  and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.     Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861   Main articles:  Naval battles of the American Civil War ,  Union blockade , and  Confederate States Navy          1861 cartoon of Scott's "" Anaconda Plan ""       Winfield Scott , the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the  Anaconda Plan [ 76 ]  to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a  Union blockade  of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan, but overruled Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.   In May 1861, Lincoln enacted the Union blockade of all Southern ports, ending regular international shipments to the Confederacy. When violators' ships and cargoes were seized, they were sold and the proceeds given to Union sailors, but the British crews were released. By late 1861, the blockade stopped most local port-to-port traffic. The blockade shut down  King Cotton , ruining the Southern economy. British investors built small, fast "" blockade runners "" that traded arms and luxuries brought in from  Bermuda ,  Cuba  and the  Bahamas  in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco. [ 77 ]  Shortages of food and other goods triggered by the blockade, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies combined to cause  hyperinflation  and bread riots in the South. [ 78 ]   On March 8, 1862, the  Confederate Navy  waged a fight against the  Union Navy  when the  ironclad   CSS  Virginia  attacked the blockade; against wooden ships she seemed unstoppable but the next day she had to fight the new Union warship  USS  Monitor  in the  Battle of the Ironclads . [ 79 ]  The battle ended in a draw, which was a strategic victory for the Union in that the blockade was sustained. The Confederacy lost the  Virginia  when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of  Monitor . Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the  Second Battle of Fort Fisher  in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.     Eastern Theater 18611863   For more details on this topic, see  Eastern Theater of the American Civil War .          A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps       Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at  Manassas ,  Virginia , in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of  Maj. Gen.   Irvin McDowell  on the Confederate forces there was halted in the  First Battle of Bull Run , or  First Manassas , [ 80 ]  whereupon they were forced back to  Washington, D.C. , by Confederate troops under the command of Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  P. G. T. Beauregard . It was in this battle that Confederate General  Thomas Jackson  received the  nickname  of ""Stonewall"" because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. [ 81 ]  Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the  U.S. Congress  passed the  Crittenden-Johnson Resolution  on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.   Maj. Gen.  George B. McClellan  took command of the Union  Army of the Potomac  on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck ), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the  peninsula  between the  York River  and  James River , southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the  Peninsula Campaign , [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ]   Johnston  halted his advance at the  Battle of Seven Pines , then General  Robert E. Lee  and top subordinates  James Longstreet  and Stonewall Jackson [ 85 ]  defeated McClellan in the  Seven Days Battles  and forced his retreat. The  Northern Virginia Campaign , which included the  Second Battle of Bull Run , ended in yet another victory for the South. [ 86 ]  McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to  John Pope's  Union  Army of Virginia , which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.   Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 45,000 men of the  Army of Northern Virginia  across the  Potomac River  into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the  Battle of Antietam [ 85 ]  near  Sharpsburg ,  Maryland , on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. [ 87 ]  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his  Emancipation Proclamation . [ 88 ]          Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863       When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Ambrose Burnside . Burnside was soon defeated at the  Battle of Fredericksburg [ 89 ]  on December 13, 1862, when over twelve thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Hooker . Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the  Battle of Chancellorsville [ 90 ]  in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen.  George Meade  during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the  Battle of Gettysburg [ 91 ]  (July 1 to July 3, 1863), the bloodiest battle of the war, which is sometimes considered the war's  turning point .  Pickett's Charge  on July 3 is often recalled as the  high-water mark of the Confederacy , not just because it signaled the end of Lee's plan to pressure Washington from the north, but also because Vicksburg, Mississippi, the key stronghold to control of the Mississippi, fell the following day. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). [ 92 ]  However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.     Western Theater 18611863   For more details on this topic, see  Western Theater of the American Civil War .   While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the  Battle of Pea Ridge . [ 93 ]   Leonidas Polk 's invasion of  Columbus ,  Kentucky  ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy.  Nashville  and central  Tennessee  fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.   Most of the  Mississippi  was opened to Union traffic with the taking of  Island No. 10  and  New Madrid ,  Missouri , and then  Memphis, Tennessee . In May 1862 the  Union Navy  captured  New Orleans [ 94 ]  without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of  Vicksburg ,  Mississippi , prevented Union control of the entire river.   General  Braxton Bragg 's second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen.  Don Carlos Buell  at the  Battle of Perryville , [ 95 ]  although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at liberating Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen.  William Rosecrans  at the  Battle of Stones River [ 96 ]  in  Tennessee .   The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the  Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet 's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas . Rosecrans retreated to  Chattanooga , which Bragg then besieged.   The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was  Ulysses S. Grant , who won victories at Forts  Henry  and  Donelson  (by which the Union seized control of the  Tennessee  and  Cumberland  Rivers);  the Battle of Shiloh ; [ 97 ]  and the  Battle of Vicksburg , [ 98 ]  which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the  turning points  of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the  Third Battle of Chattanooga , [ 99 ]  driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.     Trans-Mississippi Theater 18611865   For more details on this topic, see  Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War .   Guerrilla  activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war. [ 100 ]  The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure  Missouri ,  Indian Territory ,  New Mexico Territory , and  Arizona Territory  for the Union. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico territories were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure Indian Territory succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's  Red River Campaign  was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.     End of the war 18641865           Jefferson Davis , first and only President of the  Confederate States of America       At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen.  William Tecumseh Sherman  in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of  total war  and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. [ 101 ]  This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms, and railroads. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals George Meade and  Benjamin Butler  were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond; General  Franz Sigel  (and later  Philip Sheridan ) were to  attack the Shenandoah Valley ; General Sherman was to capture  Atlanta  and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean); Generals  George Crook  and  William W. Averell  were to operate against railroad supply lines in  West Virginia ; and Maj. Gen.  Nathaniel P. Banks  was to capture  Mobile ,  Alabama .   Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (""Grant's  Overland Campaign "") of the Eastern campaign. Grant's  battles of attrition  at the  Wilderness ,  Spotsylvania , and  Cold Harbor [ 102 ]  resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back again and again. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the  Bermuda Hundred  river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks), [ 103 ]  kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the  Siege of Petersburg , where the two armies engaged in  trench warfare  for over nine months.   Grant finally found a commander, General  Philip Sheridan , aggressive enough to prevail in the  Valley Campaigns of 1864 . Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen.  Jubal A. Early  in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at  the Battle of Cedar Creek . Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the  Shenandoah Valley , [ 104 ]  a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.   Meanwhile, Sherman marched from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  John Bell Hood  along the way.  The fall of Atlanta , [ 105 ]  on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the reelection of Lincoln as president. [ 106 ]  Hood left the Atlanta area to menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the  Franklin-Nashville Campaign . [ 107 ]  Union Maj. Gen.  John M. Schofield  defeated Hood at  the Battle of Franklin , and  George H. Thomas  dealt Hood a massive defeat at  the Battle of Nashville , effectively destroying Hood's army.          A dead confederate soldier in Petersburg, Virginia 1865, photographed by  Thomas C. Roche .       Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his "" March to the Sea "". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at  Savannah ,  Georgia  in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, [ 108 ]  increasing the pressure on Lee's army.   Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the  Battle of Five Forks  on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell [ 109 ]  to the  Union XXV Corps , composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at  Sayler's Creek , it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.     Confederate Surrenders   Main article:  Conclusion of the American Civil War   Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the  McLean House  in the  village of Appomattox Court House . [ 110 ]  In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully folding the Confederacy back into the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his officer's saber and his horse,  Traveller . On April 14, 1865,  Lincoln was shot .  Andrew Johnson  became President when Lincoln died the next day.   Events leading to Lee's surrender began with the capture of key Confederate officers  Richard S. Ewell  and  Richard H. Anderson  on April 6, following Confederate defeat at the  battle of Sayler's Creek . On April 8 Union cavalry under Major General  George Armstrong Custer  destroyed three trains of Confederate supplies at  Appomattox Station , leading to the surrender of General Lee the next day. [ 111 ]  General  St. John Richardson Liddell 's army surrendered after the loss of the Confederate fortifications at the  Battle of Spanish Fort  in Alabama, also on April 9.   On April 21  John S. Mosby s raiders of the  43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry  disbanded and on April 26 General  Joseph E. Johnston  surrendered his troops to Sherman at  Bennett Place  in  Durham ,  North Carolina . Surrendering on May 4 and 5 were the Confederate departments of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana regiments and the District of the Gulf. The Confederate President was captured on May 10 and the surrender of the Department of Florida and South Georgia happened the same day. Confederate Brigadier General  ""Jeff"" Meriwether Thompson  surrendered his brigade the next day and the day following saw the surrender of the Confederate forces of North Georgia.   On June 23, 1865, at  Fort Towson  in the Choctaw Nations' area of the  Oklahoma Territory ,  Stand Watie  signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives, becoming the last Confederate general in the field to stand down. The last Confederate ship to surrender was the  CSS  Shenandoah , on November 6, 1865, in  Liverpool ,  England . These surrenders marked the  conclusion of the American Civil War .     Slavery during the war   Main article:  Slavery in the United States   At the beginning of the war some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves ""...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union."" [ 112 ]  The same Congressmanand his fellow Radical Republicansput pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. [ 113 ]   Copperheads , the  border states  and  War Democrats  opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of  total war  needed to save the Union.   In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that ""to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."" [ 114 ]  At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War  Simon Cameron  and Generals  John C. Frmont  (in Missouri) and  David Hunter  (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) in order to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.   Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. [ 115 ]  Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State  William H. Seward  told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like ""our last shriek on the retreat"". [ 116 ]  In September 1862 the  Battle of Antietam  provided this opportunity, and the subsequent  War Governors' Conference  added support for the proclamation. [ 117 ]  Lincoln had already published a letter [ 118 ]  encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was ""somehow the cause of the war"". [ 119 ]  Lincoln issued his preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation  on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that ""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."" [ 120 ]   Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. [ 121 ]  Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, [ 122 ]  which made emancipation universal and permanent.   Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves.   Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the  Fort Pillow Massacre . [ 123 ]  This led to a breakdown of the prisoner exchange program [ 124 ]  and the growth of prison camps such as  Andersonville prison  in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease. [ 125 ]   In spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As  Howell Cobb  said, ""If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong."" Confederate generals  Patrick Cleburne  and  Robert E. Lee  argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and  Jefferson Davis  was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at  Appomattox  before this plan could be implemented. [ 126 ]   The Emancipation Proclamation [ 127 ]  greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware. [ 128 ]  The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The  13th amendment , [ 129 ]  ratified December 6, 1865, finally freed the remaining slaves in Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey, that numbered 225,000 for Kentucky, 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860. [ 130 ]     Threat of international intervention   Main article:  Britain in the American Civil War   Entry into the war by Britain and France on behalf of the Confederacy would have greatly increased the South's chances of winning independence from the Union. [ 131 ]  The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State  William H. Seward  worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton.  Cotton diplomacy  proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 186062 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that ""King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton"", as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. [ 132 ]   When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons. [ 133 ]   Charles Francis Adams  proved particularly adept as  minister  to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the  CSS  Alabama , did considerable damage and led to serious  postwar disputes . However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the  Trent Affair , involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a British mail steamer to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.   In 1862, the British considered mediationthough even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S.  Lord Palmerston  reportedly read  Uncle Toms Cabin  three times [ 134 ]  when deciding on this. The Union victory in the  Battle of Antietam  caused them to delay this decision. The  Emancipation Proclamation  further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own  seizure of Mexico  ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.     Victory and aftermath   Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Southern historian  Shelby Foote  expressed this view succinctly: ""I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."" [ 135 ]  The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves and Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the  Copperheads  and their peace platform. [ 136 ]  Lincoln had also found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.   On the other hand,  James McPherson  has argued that the Norths advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory in order to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies in order to win. [ 137 ]   Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. [ 138 ]     Comparison of Union and CSA [ 139 ]       Union   CSA       Total population   22,000,000 (71%)   9,000,000 (29%)       Free population   21,567,414   5,500,000       1860 Border state slaves   432,586   NA       1860 Southern slaves   NA   3,500,000       Soldiers   2,100,000 (67%)   1,064,000 (33%)       Railroad miles   21,788 (71%)   8,838 (29%)       Manufactured items   90%   10%       Firearm production   97%   3%       Bales of cotton in 1860   Negligible   4,500,000       Bales of cotton in 1864   Negligible   300,000       Pre-war U.S. exports   30%   70%       The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the Southern population included more than 3.5 million slaves and about 5.5 million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one compared with that of the North. [ 140 ]  The disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. [ 141 ]  Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. [ 142 ]  The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially governor  Joseph E. Brown  of Georgia and governor  Zebulon Baird Vance  of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources. [ 143 ]  The Confederacy's "" King Cotton "" misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. [ 144 ]  The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, [ 145 ]  further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864-65. [ 146 ]  European  immigrants  joined the  Union Army  in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland. [ 147 ]     Reconstruction   Main article:  Reconstruction era of the United States   Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. They disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control, that should be imposed on the South and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.   Reconstruction, which began early in the war and ended in 1877, involved a complex and rapidly changing series of federal and state policies. The long-term result came in the three  Reconstruction Amendments  to the  Constitution : the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended federal legal protections equally to citizens regardless of race; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which abolished racial restrictions on voting. Reconstruction ended in the different states at different times, the last three by the  Compromise of 1877 .   For further details on how whites in the South subverted the protections of the  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth Amendments , see:     Reconstruction era of the United States [ 148 ]   Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)   African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)   Jim Crow laws   United States v. Cruikshank  (1875)   Civil Rights Cases  (1883)   Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896)   Williams v. Mississippi  (1898)   Giles v. Harris  (1903)   Redemption (United States history)       Results          Monument in honor of the  Grand Army of the Republic , organized after the war.       Slavery effectively ended in the U.S. in the spring of 1865 when the Confederate armies surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, which stipulated that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union-controlled parts of the South were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the  Thirteenth Amendment . The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as  Reconstruction . The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deathstwo-thirds by disease. [ 149 ]  The war accounted for more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined. [ 150 ]  The  causes of the war , the reasons for its outcome, and even  the name of the war itself  are subjects of lingering controversy today. About 4 million  black   slaves  were freed in 1861-65. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all  white  males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. [ 151 ]   One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of Napoleonic tactics such as charges. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels,  Mini balls  and (near the end of the war for the Union army) repeating firearms such as the  Spencer repeating rifle  and a few experimental  Gatling guns , soldiers were decimated when standing in lines in the open. This gave birth to  trench warfare , a tactic heavily used during  World War I .

Curry: The Perils and Duty of the South - Speech Delivered in Talladega, Alabama, November 26, 1860 - This was one of many Southern states' rights arguments for defending slavery.   ^  Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, ""We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'""; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia - Stephens said: 'African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization ... was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right.'   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia The larger Stephens quote, for more context, is as follows: 'The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ""storm came and the wind blew."" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.] '   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 152-153 ( Cornerstone Speech ). Stampp said Stephens' Cornerstone Speech ""was in striking contrast to his postwar constitutional interpretation.""   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 6365 ( A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States ) Stampp used the following quote to illustrate the fact that, after Confederate defeat, Stephens argued that the war was caused not by slavery but by states' rights controversies: ""It is a postulate, with many writers of this day, that the late War was the result of two opposing ideas, or principles, upon the subject of African Slavery. Between these, according to their theory, sprung the 'irrepressible conflict,' in principle, which ended in the terrible conflict in arms. Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers. That the war had its origin in opposing principles, which in their action upon the conduct of men, produced the ultimate conflict of arms, may be assumed as an unquestionable fact. But the opposing principles which produced these results in physical action were of a very different character from those assumed in the postulate. They lay in the organic Structure of the Government of the States ... between the supporters of a strictly Federative Government, on the one side, and a thoroughly National one, on the other.""   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge page 4. McPherson writes, ""After the war, however, Davis and Stephens changed their tune. By the time they wrote their histories of the Confederacy, slavery was gone with the wind -- a dead and discredited institution. To concede that the Confederacy had broken up the United States and launched a war that killed 620,000 Americans in a vain attempt to keep four million people in bondage would not confer honor on their lost cause.   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pages 3-9. Speaking of alternative explanations for secession, McPherson writes (p.7), ""While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.   ^  Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852-1857, pages 267269   ^  Freehling,  Prelude to Civil War,  page 297; Willentz page 388 - On March 13, 1833, Rhett said, ""A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands... Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions  Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff  not Internal Improvement  nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced  but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government... there is no liberty  no security for the South.""   ^  As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened: ""I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness."" - Ellis, Richard E. The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816-1836. (1965), page 257; Ellis p. 193. Ellis further notes that ""Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states rights. At various points in their careers,  John Taylor ,  John Randolph , and  Nathaniel Macon  had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners wishes.""   ^  John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union, page 197 - The author said the following about Calhoun's description of the tariff issue: ""Finally, the root of the nullification crisis was exposed. What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.""   ^  William E.

Eleven  Southern   slave states  declared their  secession  from the U.S. and formed the  Confederate States of America  (the Confederacy). Led by  Jefferson Davis , they fought against the U.S. federal government (the "" Union ""), which was supported by all the  free states  and the five  border slave states .   In the  presidential election of 1860 , the  Republican Party , led by  Abraham Lincoln , had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .   Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when  Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation  at  Fort Sumter  in  South Carolina . Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state, leading to declarations of secession by four more Southern slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a  naval blockade . In September 1862, Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation  made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander  Robert E. Lee  won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back at  Gettysburg  and, in the west, the Union gained control of the  Mississippi River  at the  Battle of Vicksburg , thereby splitting the Confederacy. Long-term Union advantages in men and material were realized in 1864 when  Ulysses S. Grant  fought  battles of attrition  against Lee as Union general  William Sherman  captured  Atlanta ,  Georgia  and  marched to the sea . Confederate resistance collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox Court House  on April 9, 1865.   The American Civil War was the deadliest war in  American history , causing 620,000 soldier deaths, and an undetermined number of civilian casualties, ending  slavery  in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the  federal government . The social, political, economic and racial  issues  of the war decisively shaped the  reconstruction era that lasted to 1877 , and continue into the 21st century.

Lincoln  did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858  House Divided Speech , expressed a desire to ""arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction"". [ 1 ]  Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  All of the organized territories were likely to become free-soil states, which increased the Southern movement toward secession. Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand it would wither and die. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern fears that the  slave power  already controlled the government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Sectional disagreements over the  morality of slavery , the scope of democracy and the economic merits of  free labor  vs. slave  plantations  caused the  Whig  and "" Know-Nothing "" parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the  Free Soil Party  in 1848, the  Republicans  in 1854, the  Constitutional Union  in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the  Democratic Party , split along sectional lines.   Both North and South were influenced by the ideas of  Thomas Jefferson . Southerners emphasized, in connection with slavery, the  states' rights [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  ideas mentioned in Jefferson's  Kentucky Resolutions . Northerners ranging from the abolitionist  William Lloyd Garrison  to the moderate Republican leader  Abraham Lincoln [ 11 ]  emphasized Jefferson's declaration that  all men are created equal . Lincoln mentioned this proposition in his  Gettysburg Address .   Confederate Vice President  Alexander Stephens  said [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  that slavery was the chief cause of secession [ 14 ]  in his  Cornerstone Speech  shortly before the war. After Confederate defeat, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the  Lost Cause . [ 15 ]  There was a striking contrast  [ 14 ] [ 16 ]  between Stephens' post-war states' rights assertion that slavery did  not  cause secession [ 15 ]  and his pre-war  Cornerstone Speech . Confederate President Jefferson Davis also switched from saying the war was caused by slavery to saying that states' rights was the cause. While Southerners often used states' rights arguments to defend slavery, sometimes roles were reversed, as when Southerners demanded national laws to defend their interests with the  Gag Rule  and the  Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 . On these issues, it was Northerners who wanted to defend the rights of their states. [ 17 ]   Almost all of the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the  three-fifths clause  and a twenty year extension of the  African slave trade  in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. There was controversy over adding the slave state of  Missouri  to the Union that led to the  Missouri Compromise  of 1820, the  Nullification Crisis  over the  Tariff of 1828  (although the tariff was low after 1846, [ 18 ]  and even the tariff issue was related to slavery), [ 19 ] [ 20 ]   [ 21 ]  the gag rule that prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 18351844, the acquisition of  Texas  as a  slave state  in 1845 and  Manifest Destiny  as an argument for gaining new territories where slavery would become an issue after the  MexicanAmerican War  (18461848), which resulted in the  Compromise of 1850 . [ 22 ]  The  Wilmot Proviso  was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from  Mexico . The extremely popular antislavery novel  Uncle Toms Cabin  (1852) by  Harriet Beecher Stowe  greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]   The 1854  Ostend Manifesto  was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex  Cuba  as a slave state. The  Second Party System  broke down after passage of the  Kansas-Nebraska Act  in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with  popular sovereignty , allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The  Bleeding Kansas  controversy over the status of slavery in the  Kansas Territory  included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery  Border Ruffians . Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents  Franklin Pierce  and  James Buchanan  to make attempts (including support for the pro-slavery  Lecompton Constitution ) to admit Kansas as a slave state. [ 25 ]  Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the  Wakarusa War , [ 26 ]  the  Sacking of Lawrence , [ 27 ]  the  caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks , [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]  the  Pottawatomie Massacre , [ 30 ]  the  Battle of Black Jack , the  Battle of Osawatomie  and the  Marais des Cygnes massacre . The 1857 Supreme Court  Dred Scott decision  allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas. The  Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858  included Northern Democratic leader  Stephen A. Douglas '  Freeport Doctrine . This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision which, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist  John Brown 's raid at  Harpers Ferry Armory  was an attempt to incite slave insurrections in 1859.  [ 31 ]  The North-South split in the  Democratic Party  in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.   Other factors include sectionalism (caused by the growth of slavery in the lower South while slavery was gradually phased out in Northern states) and economic differences between North and South, although most modern historians disagree with the extreme economic determinism of historian  Charles Beard  and argue that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. [ 32 ]  There was the polarizing effect of slavery that split the largest religious denominations (the  Methodist ,  Baptist  and  Presbyterian  churches) [ 33 ]  and controversy caused by the worst cruelties of slavery (whippings, mutilations and families split apart). The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North, plus the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. [ 34 ]   The  election of Lincoln in 1860  was the final trigger for secession. [ 35 ]  Efforts at compromise, including the "" Corwin Amendment "" and the "" Crittenden Compromise "", failed. Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North.     Slavery       Main article:  Slavery in the United States               Abraham Lincoln  16th  President of the United States  (18611865)       Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region; states of the  deep South  which had the greatest concentration of plantations were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of  Virginia ,  North Carolina ,  Arkansas , and  Tennessee  had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the  Fort Sumter  crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  As of 1850 the percentage of Southern whites living in families that owned slaves was 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union. [ 38 ]  85 percent of slaveowners who owned 100 or more slaves lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states. [ 38 ]  Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North. [ 39 ]   Over the 1850s slaves left the  border states  through sale, manumission and escape, and border states also had more free blacks and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area. Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make  Kansas  a slave state. By 1860 the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased. [ 40 ]   The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in  Dred Scott v. Sandford  added to the controversy.  Chief Justice   Roger B. Taney's  decision said that slaves were ""so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect"", [ 41 ]  and that slavery could spread into the territories. Lincoln warned that ""the next  Dred Scott  decision"" [ 42 ]  could threaten Northern states with slavery.   Northern politician  Abraham Lincoln  said, ""this question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."" [ 43 ]  The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories, [ 44 ]  and the Southern demand for a  slave code  for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that ""our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery."" [ 45 ]  Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, Southerners throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.   Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]  The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  said that the non-slave-holding states were ""proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color"", and that the African race ""were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race"". Alabama secessionist E. S. Dargan warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin. [ 52 ]   Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S.  Postmaster General  refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South. [ 53 ]  Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. [ 54 ]  The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, ""Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests"". [ 55 ]   Non-slavery related causes of secession  do exist, but have little to do with tariffs or states' rights.

South Carolina adopted the "" Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union "" on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the  Fugitive Slave Act , claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All of the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.     Secession winter   Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the  Confederate States of America  on February 4, 1861. [ 56 ]  They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President  James Buchanan , whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the  Dred Scott decision  was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union ""was intended to be perpetual"", but that ""the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union"" was not among the ""enumerated powers granted to Congress"". [ 57 ]  One quarter of the U.S. Armythe entire garrison in Texaswas surrendered to state forces by its commanding general,  David E. Twiggs , who then joined the Confederacy.   As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, secession later enabled Republicans to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the  Morrill Tariff , land grant colleges (the  Morill Act ), a  Homestead Act , a trans-continental railroad (the  Pacific Railway Acts ), the  National Banking Act  and the authorization of  United States Notes  by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The  Revenue Act of 1861  introduced the  income tax  to help finance the war.     The Confederacy       Main article:  Confederate States of America       Seven  Deep South  cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with  South Carolina ,  Mississippi ,  Florida ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Louisiana , and  Texas . These seven states formed the  Confederate States of America  (February 4, 1861), with  Jefferson Davis  as president, and a  governmental structure  closely modeled on the  U.S. Constitution . Following the  attack on Fort Sumter , President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy:  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  North Carolina  and  Tennessee . The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of  West Virginia  on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861,  Missouri  and  Kentucky  were divided  each of them having a pro-Southern and pro-Northern government.     The Union states       Main article:  Union (American Civil War)       Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union:  California ,  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Iowa ,  Kansas ,  Kentucky ,  Maine ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Michigan ,  Minnesota ,  Missouri ,  New Hampshire ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Ohio ,  Oregon ,  Pennsylvania ,  Rhode Island ,  Vermont , and  Wisconsin . During the war,  Nevada  and  West Virginia  joined as new states of the Union.  Tennessee  and  Louisiana  were returned to Union military control early in the war.   The territories of  Colorado ,  Dakota ,  Nebraska ,  Nevada ,  New Mexico ,  Utah , and  Washington  fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding  Native American  tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the  Indian territory  (now  Oklahoma ) a small bloody civil war.     Border states       Main article:  Border states (Civil War)       The border states in the Union were  West Virginia  (which was separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ( Maryland ,  Delaware ,  Missouri , and  Kentucky ).   Maryland  had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union  rioting in Baltimore  and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with  martial law  and called for troops. Militia units that had been drilling in the North rushed toward Washington and Baltimore. [ 58 ]  Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland (and the separate  District of Columbia ), by arresting all the Maryland government members and holding them without trial.   In Missouri, an  elected convention  on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor  Claiborne F. Jackson  called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General  Nathaniel Lyon . After the  Camp Jackson Affair  Lyon chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ( See also:  Missouri secession ). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri. [ 59 ]   Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September, 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its loyal status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky. [ 60 ]   After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in Wheeling asked a total of 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on Oct. 24, 1861. Returns were received from 41 of the 48 counties, [ 61 ]  and a minority turnout voted heavily in favor of the new state, [ 62 ]  at first called ""Kanawha"" but later renamed ""West Virginia"", which was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863. Jefferson and Berkeley counties were annexed to the new state in late 1863. [ 63 ]  The western counties of Virginia had voted nearly 2 to 1 against secession, though 24 of the 50 counties had voted for secession. [ 64 ]  Soldier numbers from West Virginia were about evenly divided between the Confederacy and the Union. [ 65 ]   Similar Unionist secessions attempts appeared in  East Tennessee , but were suppressed by the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union and held them without trial. [ 66 ]     Overview          A  Roman Catholic  Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass       Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee. [ 67 ]  Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see  List of American Civil War battles  and  Military leadership in the American Civil War .     The war begins       For more details on this topic, see  Battle of Fort Sumter .       Lincoln's victory in the  presidential election of 1860  triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the  Confederate States of America  and established their temporary capital at  Montgomery ,  Alabama . A pre-war February  Peace Conference of 1861  met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response aside from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter via the ship  Star of the West , which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort. [ 68 ]  However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.   On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his  inaugural address , he argued that the Constitution was a  more perfect union  than the earlier  Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , that it was a binding contract, and called any secession ""legally void"". [ 69 ]  He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. [ 70 ]   The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents on the grounds that the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. [ 71 ]  However, Secretary of State William Seward engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. [ 71 ]   Fort Sumter  in Charleston, South Carolina,  Fort Monroe ,  Fort Pickens  and  Fort Taylor  were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold Fort Sumter. Under orders from Confederate President  Jefferson Davis , troops controlled by the Confederate government under  P. G. T. Beauregard  bombarded the fort with artillery on April 12, forcing the fort's capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all of the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. [ 72 ]  For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day. [ 73 ]   Liberty Arsenal  in  Liberty, Missouri  was seized eight days after Fort Sumter.   Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to  Richmond . [ 74 ]  The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of  Atlanta  and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged  Petersburg  and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.     Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861       Main articles:  Naval battles of the American Civil War ,  Union blockade , and  Confederate States Navy              1861 cartoon of Scott's "" Anaconda Plan ""       Winfield Scott , the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the  Anaconda Plan [ 75 ]  to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a  Union blockade  of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan, but overruled Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.   In May 1861, Lincoln enacted the Union blockade of all Southern ports, ending regular international shipments to the Confederacy. When violators' ships and cargoes were seized, they were sold and the proceeds given to Union sailors, but the British crews were released. By late 1861, the blockade stopped most local port-to-port traffic. The blockade shut down  King Cotton , ruining the Southern economy. British investors built small, fast "" blockade runners "" that traded arms and luxuries brought in from  Bermuda ,  Cuba  and the  Bahamas  in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco. [ 76 ]  Shortages of food and other goods triggered by the blockade, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies combined to cause  hyperinflation  and bread riots in the South. [ 77 ]   On March 8, 1862, the  Confederate Navy  waged a fight against the  Union Navy  when the  ironclad   CSS  Virginia  attacked the blockade; against wooden ships she seemed unstoppable but the next day she had to fight the new Union warship  USS  Monitor  in the  Battle of the Ironclads . [ 78 ]  The battle ended in a draw, which was a strategic victory for the Union in that the blockade was sustained. The Confederacy lost the  Virginia  when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of  Monitor . Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the  Second Battle of Fort Fisher  in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.     Eastern Theater 18611863       For more details on this topic, see  Eastern Theater of the American Civil War .              A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps       Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at  Manassas ,  Virginia , in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of  Maj. Gen.   Irvin McDowell  on the Confederate forces there was halted in the  First Battle of Bull Run , or  First Manassas , [ 79 ]  whereupon they were forced back to  Washington, D.C. , by Confederate troops under the command of Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  P. G. T. Beauregard . It was in this battle that Confederate General  Thomas Jackson  received the  nickname  of ""Stonewall"" because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. [ 80 ]  Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the  U.S. Congress  passed the  Crittenden-Johnson Resolution  on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.   Maj. Gen.  George B. McClellan  took command of the Union  Army of the Potomac  on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck ), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the  peninsula  between the  York River  and  James River , southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the  Peninsula Campaign , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Johnston  halted his advance at the  Battle of Seven Pines , then General  Robert E. Lee  and top subordinates  James Longstreet  and Stonewall Jackson [ 84 ]  defeated McClellan in the  Seven Days Battles  and forced his retreat. The  Northern Virginia Campaign , which included the  Second Battle of Bull Run , ended in yet another victory for the South. [ 85 ]  McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to  John Pope's  Union  Army of Virginia , which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.   Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 45,000 men of the  Army of Northern Virginia  across the  Potomac River  into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the  Battle of Antietam [ 84 ]  near  Sharpsburg ,  Maryland , on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. [ 86 ]  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his  Emancipation Proclamation . [ 87 ]          Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863       When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Ambrose Burnside . Burnside was soon defeated at the  Battle of Fredericksburg [ 88 ]  on December 13, 1862, when over twelve thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Hooker . Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the  Battle of Chancellorsville [ 89 ]  in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen.  George Meade  during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the  Battle of Gettysburg [ 90 ]  (July 1 to July 3, 1863), the bloodiest battle of the war, which is sometimes considered the war's  turning point .  Pickett's Charge  on July 3 is often recalled as the  high-water mark of the Confederacy , not just because it signaled the end of Lee's plan to pressure Washington from the north, but also because Vicksburg, Mississippi, the key stronghold to control of the Mississippi, fell the following day. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). [ 91 ]  However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.     Western Theater 18611863       For more details on this topic, see  Western Theater of the American Civil War .       While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the  Battle of Pea Ridge . [ 92 ]   Leonidas Polk 's invasion of  Columbus ,  Kentucky  ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy.  Nashville  and central  Tennessee  fell to the Union early in 1862, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization. A commander of US troops in Gallatin executed suspected spies.   Most of the  Mississippi  was opened to Union traffic with the taking of  Island No. 10  and  New Madrid ,  Missouri , and then  Memphis, Tennessee . In May 1862 the  Union Navy  captured  New Orleans [ 93 ]  without a major fight, which allowed Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi. Only the fortress city of  Vicksburg ,  Mississippi , prevented Union control of the entire river.   General  Braxton Bragg 's second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen.  Don Carlos Buell  at the  Battle of Perryville , [ 94 ]  although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at liberating Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen.  William Rosecrans  at the  Battle of Stones River [ 95 ]  in  Tennessee .   The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the  Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet 's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas . Rosecrans retreated to  Chattanooga , which Bragg then besieged.   The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was  Ulysses S. Grant , who won victories at Forts  Henry  and  Donelson  (by which the Union seized control of the  Tennessee  and  Cumberland  Rivers);  the Battle of Shiloh ; [ 96 ]  and the  Battle of Vicksburg , [ 97 ]  which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the  turning points  of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the  Third Battle of Chattanooga , [ 98 ]  driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.     Trans-Mississippi Theater 18611865       For more details on this topic, see  Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War .       Guerrilla  activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war. [ 99 ]  The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure  Missouri ,  Indian Territory ,  New Mexico Territory , and  Arizona Territory  for the Union. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico territories were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure Indian Territory succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's  Red River Campaign  was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.     End of the war 18641865           Jefferson Davis , first and only President of the  Confederate States of America       At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen.  William Tecumseh Sherman  in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of  total war  and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. [ 100 ]  This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms and railroad tracks. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals George Meade and  Benjamin Butler  were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond; General  Franz Sigel  (and later  Philip Sheridan ) were to  attack the Shenandoah Valley ; General Sherman was to capture  Atlanta  and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean); Generals  George Crook  and  William W. Averell  were to operate against railroad supply lines in  West Virginia ; and Maj. Gen.  Nathaniel P. Banks  was to capture  Mobile ,  Alabama .   Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (""Grant's  Overland Campaign "") of the Eastern campaign. Grant's  battles of attrition  at the  Wilderness ,  Spotsylvania , and  Cold Harbor [ 101 ]  resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back again and again. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the  Bermuda Hundred  river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks), [ 102 ]  kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the  Siege of Petersburg , where the two armies engaged in  trench warfare  for over nine months.   Grant finally found a commander, General  Philip Sheridan , aggressive enough to prevail in the  Valley Campaigns of 1864 . Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen.  Jubal A. Early  in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at  the Battle of Cedar Creek . Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the  Shenandoah Valley , [ 103 ]  a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.   Meanwhile, Sherman marched from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  John Bell Hood  along the way.  The fall of Atlanta , [ 104 ]  on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the reelection of Lincoln as president. [ 105 ]  Hood left the Atlanta area to menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the  Franklin-Nashville Campaign . [ 106 ]  Union Maj. Gen.  John M. Schofield  defeated Hood at  the Battle of Franklin , and  George H. Thomas  dealt Hood a massive defeat at  the Battle of Nashville , effectively destroying Hood's army.          A dead soldier in Petersburg, Virginia 1865, photographed by  Thomas C. Roche .       Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his "" March to the Sea "". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at  Savannah ,  Georgia  in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, [ 107 ]  increasing the pressure on Lee's army.   Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the  Battle of Five Forks  on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell [ 108 ]  to the  Union XXV Corps , composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at  Sayler's Creek , it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.     Confederate Surrenders       Main article:  Conclusion of the American Civil War       Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the  McLean House  in the  village of Appomattox Court House . [ 109 ]  In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully folding the Confederacy back into the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his officer's saber and his horse,  Traveller . On April 14, 1865,  Lincoln was shot .  Andrew Johnson  became President when Lincoln died the next day.   Events leading to Lee's surrender began with the capture of key Confederate officers  Richard S. Ewell  and  Richard H. Anderson  on April 6, following Confederate defeat at the  battle of Sayler's Creek . On April 8 Union cavalry under Major General  George Armstrong Custer  destroyed three trains of Confederate supplies at  Appomattox Station , leading to the surrender of General Lee the next day. [ 110 ]  General  St. John Richardson Liddell 's army surrendered after the loss of the Confederate fortifications at the  Battle of Spanish Fort  in Alabama, also on April 9.   On April 21  John S. Mosby s raiders of the  43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry  disbanded and on April 26 General  Joseph E. Johnston  surrendered to  Major General   William Sherman  at  Bennett Place . Surrendering on May 4 and 5 were the Confederate departments of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana regiments and the District of the Gulf. The Confederate President was captured on May 10 and the surrender of the Department of Florida and South Georgia happened the same day. Confederate Brigadier General  ""Jeff"" Meriwether Thompson  surrendered his brigade the next day and the day following saw the surrender of the Confederate forces of North Georgia. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman on April 26, 1865, in  Durham ,  North Carolina .   On June 23, 1865, at  Fort Towson  in the Choctaw Nations' area of the  Oklahoma Territory ,  Stand Watie  signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives, becoming the last Confederate general in the field to stand down. The last Confederate ship to surrender was the  CSS  Shenandoah , on November 6, 1865, in  Liverpool ,  England . These surrenders marked the  conclusion of the American Civil War .     Slavery during the war       Main article:  Slavery in the United States       At the beginning of the war some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves ""...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union."" [ 111 ]  The same Congressmanand his fellow Radical Republicansput pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. [ 112 ]   Copperheads , the  border states  and  War Democrats  opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of  total war  needed to save the Union.   In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that ""to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."" [ 113 ]  At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War  Simon Cameron  and Generals  John C. Frmont  (in Missouri) and  David Hunter  (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) in order to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.   Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. [ 114 ]  Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State  William H. Seward  told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like ""our last shriek on the retreat"". [ 115 ]  In September 1862 the  Battle of Antietam  provided this opportunity, and the subsequent  War Governors' Conference  added support for the proclamation. [ 116 ]  Lincoln had already published a letter [ 117 ]  encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was ""somehow the cause of the war"". [ 118 ]  Lincoln issued his preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation  on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that ""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."" [ 119 ]   Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. [ 120 ]  Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, [ 121 ]  which made emancipation universal and permanent.   Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves.   Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the  Fort Pillow Massacre . [ 122 ]  This led to a breakdown of the prisoner exchange program [ 123 ]  and the growth of prison camps such as  Andersonville prison  in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease. [ 124 ]   In spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As  Howell Cobb  said, ""If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong."" Confederate generals  Patrick Cleburne  and  Robert E. Lee  argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and  Jefferson Davis  was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at  Appomattox  before this plan could be implemented. [ 125 ]   The Emancipation Proclamation [ 126 ]  greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware. [ 127 ]  The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The  13th amendment , [ 128 ]  ratified December 6, 1865, finally freed the remaining slaves in Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey, that numbered 225,000 for Kentucky, 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860. [ 129 ]     Threat of international intervention       Main article:  Britain in the American Civil War       Entry into the war by Britain and France on behalf of the Confederacy would have greatly increased the South's chances of winning independence from the Union. [ 130 ]  The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State  William H. Seward  worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton.  Cotton diplomacy  proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 186062 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that ""King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton"", as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. [ 131 ]   When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons. [ 132 ]   Charles Francis Adams  proved particularly adept as  minister  to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the  CSS  Alabama , did considerable damage and led to serious  postwar disputes . However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the  Trent Affair , involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a British mail steamer to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.   In 1862, the British considered mediationthough even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S.  Lord Palmerston  reportedly read  Uncle Toms Cabin  three times [ 133 ]  when deciding on this. The Union victory in the  Battle of Antietam  caused them to delay this decision. The  Emancipation Proclamation  further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own  seizure of Mexico  ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.     Victory and aftermath   Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Southern historian  Shelby Foote  expressed this view succinctly: ""I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."" [ 134 ]  The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves and Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the  Copperheads  and their peace platform. [ 135 ]  Lincoln had also found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.   On the other hand,  James McPherson  has argued that the Norths advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory in order to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies in order to win. [ 136 ]   Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. [ 137 ]     Comparison of Union and CSA [ 138 ]       Union   CSA       Total population   22,000,000 (71%)   9,000,000 (29%)       Free population   21,567,414   5,500,000       1860 Border state slaves   432,586   NA       1860 Southern slaves   NA   3,500,000       Soldiers   2,200,000 (67%)   1,064,000 (33%)       Railroad miles   21,788 (71%)   8,838 (29%)       Manufactured items   90%   10%       Firearm production   97%   3%       Bales of cotton in 1860   Negligible   4,500,000       Bales of cotton in 1864   Negligible   300,000       Pre-war U.S. exports   30%   70%       The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the Southern population included more than 3.5 million slaves and about 5.5 million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one compared with that of the North. [ 139 ]  The disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. [ 140 ]  Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. [ 141 ]  The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially governor  Joseph E. Brown  of Georgia and governor  Zebulon Baird Vance  of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources. [ 142 ]  The Confederacy's "" King Cotton "" misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. [ 143 ]  The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, [ 144 ]  further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864-65. [ 145 ]  European  immigrants  joined the  Union Army  in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland. [ 146 ]     Reconstruction       Main article:  Reconstruction era of the United States       Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. They disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control, that should be imposed on the South and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.   Reconstruction, which began early in the war and ended in 1877, involved a complex and rapidly changing series of federal and state policies. The long-term result came in the three  Reconstruction Amendments  to the  Constitution : the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended federal legal protections equally to citizens regardless of race; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which abolished racial restrictions on voting. Reconstruction ended in the different states at different times, the last three by the  Compromise of 1877 .   For further details on how whites in the South subverted the protections of the  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth Amendments , see:     Reconstruction era of the United States [ 147 ]   Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)   African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)   Jim Crow laws   United States v. Cruikshank  (1875)   Civil Rights Cases  (1883)   Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896)   Williams v. Mississippi  (1898)   Giles v. Harris  (1903)   Redemption (United States history)       Results          Monument in honor of the  Grand Army of the Republic , organized after the war.       Slavery effectively ended in the U.S. in the spring of 1865 when the Confederate armies surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, which stipulated that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union-controlled parts of the South were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the  Thirteenth Amendment . The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as  Reconstruction . The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deathstwo-thirds by disease. [ 148 ]  The war accounted for more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined. [ 149 ]  The  causes of the war , the reasons for its outcome, and even  the name of the war itself  are subjects of lingering controversy today. About 4 million  black   slaves  were freed in 1861-65. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all  white  males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. [ 150 ]   One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of Napoleonic tactics such as charges. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels,  Mini balls  and (near the end of the war for the Union army) repeating firearms such as the  Spencer repeating rifle  and a few experimental  Gatling guns , soldiers were decimated when standing in lines in the open. This gave birth to  trench warfare , a tactic heavily used during  World War I .

Curry: The Perils and Duty of the South - Speech Delivered in Talladega, Alabama, November 26, 1860 - This was one of many Southern states' rights arguments for defending slavery.   ^  Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, ""We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'""; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia - Stephens said: 'African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization ... was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right.'   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia The larger Stephens quote, for more context, is as follows: 'The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ""storm came and the wind blew."" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.] '   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 152-153 ( Cornerstone Speech ). Stampp said Stephens' Cornerstone Speech ""was in striking contrast to his postwar constitutional interpretation.""   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 6365 ( A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States ) Stampp used the following quote to illustrate the fact that, after Confederate defeat, Stephens argued that the war was caused not by slavery but by states' rights controversies: ""It is a postulate, with many writers of this day, that the late War was the result of two opposing ideas, or principles, upon the subject of African Slavery. Between these, according to their theory, sprung the 'irrepressible conflict,' in principle, which ended in the terrible conflict in arms. Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers. That the war had its origin in opposing principles, which in their action upon the conduct of men, produced the ultimate conflict of arms, may be assumed as an unquestionable fact. But the opposing principles which produced these results in physical action were of a very different character from those assumed in the postulate. They lay in the organic Structure of the Government of the States ... between the supporters of a strictly Federative Government, on the one side, and a thoroughly National one, on the other.""   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge page 4. McPherson writes, ""After the war, however, Davis and Stephens changed their tune. By the time they wrote their histories of the Confederacy, slavery was gone with the wind -- a dead and discredited institution. To concede that the Confederacy had broken up the United States and launched a war that killed 620,000 Americans in a vain attempt to keep four million people in bondage would not confer honor on their lost cause.   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pages 3-9. Speaking of alternative explanations for secession, McPherson writes (p. 7), ""While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.   ^  Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852-1857, pages 267269   ^  Freehling,  Prelude to Civil War,  page 297; Willentz page 388 - On March 13, 1833, Rhett said, ""A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands... Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions  Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff  not Internal Improvement  nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced  but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government... there is no liberty  no security for the South.""   ^  As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened: ""I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness."" - Ellis, Richard E. The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816-1836. (1965), page 257; Ellis p. 193. Ellis further notes that ""Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states rights. At various points in their careers,  John Taylor ,  John Randolph , and  Nathaniel Macon  had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners wishes.""   ^  John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union, page 197 - The author said the following about Calhoun's description of the tariff issue: ""Finally, the root of the nullification crisis was exposed. What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.""   ^  William E.

Eleven  Southern   slave states  declared their  secession  from the U.S. and formed the  Confederate States of America  (the Confederacy). Led by  Jefferson Davis , they fought against the U.S. federal government (the "" Union ""), which was supported by all the  free states  and the five  border slave states .   In the  presidential election of 1860 , the  Republican Party , led by  Abraham Lincoln , had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their  secession  from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as  rebellion .   Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when  Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation  at  Fort Sumter  in  South Carolina . Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state, leading to declarations of secession by four more Southern slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a  naval blockade . In September 1862, Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation  made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander  Robert E. Lee  won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back at  Gettysburg  and, in the west, the Union gained control of the  Mississippi River  at the  Battle of Vicksburg , thereby splitting the Confederacy. Long-term Union advantages in men and material were realized in 1864 when  Ulysses S. Grant  fought  battles of attrition  against Lee as Union general  William Sherman  captured  Atlanta ,  Georgia  and  marched to the sea . Confederate resistance collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox Court House  on April 9, 1865.   The American Civil War was the deadliest war in  American history , causing 620,000 soldier deaths and an undetermined number of civilian casualties, ending  slavery  in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the  federal government . The social, political, economic and racial  issues  of the war decisively shaped the  reconstruction era that lasted to 1877 , and continue into the 21st century.

Lincoln  did not propose federal laws against slavery where it already existed, but he had, in his 1858  House Divided Speech , expressed a desire to ""arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction"". [ 1 ]  Much of the political battle in the 1850s focused on the expansion of slavery into the newly created territories. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  All of the organized territories were likely to become free-soil states, which increased the Southern movement toward secession. Both North and South assumed that if slavery could not expand it would wither and die. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   Southern fears of losing control of the federal government to antislavery forces, and Northern fears that the  slave power  already controlled the government, brought the crisis to a head in the late 1850s. Sectional disagreements over the  morality of slavery , the scope of democracy and the economic merits of  free labor  vs. slave  plantations  caused the  Whig  and "" Know-Nothing "" parties to collapse, and new ones to arise (the  Free Soil Party  in 1848, the  Republicans  in 1854, the  Constitutional Union  in 1860). In 1860, the last remaining national political party, the  Democratic Party , split along sectional lines.   Both North and South were influenced by the ideas of  Thomas Jefferson . Southerners emphasized, in connection with slavery, the  states' rights [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  ideas mentioned in Jefferson's  Kentucky Resolutions . Northerners ranging from the abolitionist  William Lloyd Garrison  to the moderate Republican leader  Abraham Lincoln [ 11 ]  emphasized Jefferson's declaration that  all men are created equal . Lincoln mentioned this proposition in his  Gettysburg Address .   Confederate Vice President  Alexander Stephens  said [ 12 ] [ 13 ]  that slavery was the chief cause of secession [ 14 ]  in his  Cornerstone Speech  shortly before the war. After Confederate defeat, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the  Lost Cause . [ 15 ]  There was a striking contrast  [ 14 ] [ 16 ]  between Stephens' post-war states' rights assertion that slavery did  not  cause secession [ 15 ]  and his pre-war  Cornerstone Speech . Confederate President Jefferson Davis also switched from saying the war was caused by slavery to saying that states' rights was the cause. While Southerners often used states' rights arguments to defend slavery, sometimes roles were reversed, as when Southerners demanded national laws to defend their interests with the  Gag Rule  and the  Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 . On these issues, it was Northerners who wanted to defend the rights of their states. [ 17 ]   Almost all of the inter-regional crises involved slavery, starting with debates on the  three-fifths clause  and a twenty year extension of the  African slave trade  in the Constitutional Convention of 1787. There was controversy over adding the slave state of  Missouri  to the Union that led to the  Missouri Compromise  of 1820, the  Nullification Crisis  over the  Tariff of 1828  (although the tariff was low after 1846, [ 18 ]  and even the tariff issue was related to slavery), [ 19 ] [ 20 ]   [ 21 ]  the gag rule that prevented discussion in Congress of petitions for ending slavery from 18351844, the acquisition of  Texas  as a  slave state  in 1845 and  Manifest Destiny  as an argument for gaining new territories where slavery would become an issue after the  MexicanAmerican War  (18461848), which resulted in the  Compromise of 1850 . [ 22 ]  The  Wilmot Proviso  was an attempt by Northern politicians to exclude slavery from the territories conquered from  Mexico . The extremely popular antislavery novel  Uncle Toms Cabin  (1852) by  Harriet Beecher Stowe  greatly increased Northern opposition to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. [ 23 ] [ 24 ]   The 1854  Ostend Manifesto  was an unsuccessful Southern attempt to annex  Cuba  as a slave state. The  Second Party System  broke down after passage of the  Kansas-Nebraska Act  in 1854, which replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery with  popular sovereignty , allowing the people of a territory to vote for or against slavery. The  Bleeding Kansas  controversy over the status of slavery in the  Kansas Territory  included massive vote fraud perpetrated by Missouri pro-slavery  Border Ruffians . Vote fraud led pro-South Presidents  Franklin Pierce  and  James Buchanan  to make attempts (including support for the pro-slavery  Lecompton Constitution ) to admit Kansas as a slave state. [ 25 ]  Violence over the status of slavery in Kansas erupted with the  Wakarusa War , [ 26 ]  the  Sacking of Lawrence , [ 27 ]  the  caning of Republican Charles Sumner by the Southerner Preston Brooks , [ 28 ]   [ 29 ]  the  Pottawatomie Massacre , [ 30 ]  the  Battle of Black Jack , the  Battle of Osawatomie  and the  Marais des Cygnes massacre . The 1857 Supreme Court  Dred Scott decision  allowed slavery in the territories even where the majority opposed slavery, including Kansas. The  Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858  included Northern Democratic leader  Stephen A. Douglas '  Freeport Doctrine . This doctrine was an argument for thwarting the Dred Scott decision which, along with Douglas' defeat of the Lecompton Constitution, divided the Democratic Party between North and South. Northern abolitionist  John Brown 's raid at  Harpers Ferry Armory  was an attempt to incite slave insurrections in 1859.  [ 31 ]  The North-South split in the  Democratic Party  in 1860 due to the Southern demand for a slave code for the territories completed polarization of the nation between North and South.   Other factors include sectionalism (caused by the growth of slavery in the lower South while slavery was gradually phased out in Northern states) and economic differences between North and South, although most modern historians disagree with the extreme economic determinism of historian  Charles Beard  and argue that Northern and Southern economies were largely complementary. [ 32 ]  There was the polarizing effect of slavery that split the largest religious denominations (the  Methodist ,  Baptist  and  Presbyterian  churches) [ 33 ]  and controversy caused by the worst cruelties of slavery (whippings, mutilations and families split apart). The fact that seven immigrants out of eight settled in the North, plus the fact that twice as many whites left the South for the North as vice versa, contributed to the South's defensive-aggressive political behavior. [ 34 ]   The  election of Lincoln in 1860  was the final trigger for secession. [ 35 ]  Efforts at compromise, including the "" Corwin Amendment "" and the "" Crittenden Compromise "", failed. Southern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North.     Slavery       Main article:  Slavery in the United States               Abraham Lincoln  16th  President of the United States  (18611865)       Support for secession was strongly correlated to the number of plantations in the region; states of the  deep South  which had the greatest concentration of plantations were the first to secede. The upper South slave states of  Virginia ,  North Carolina ,  Arkansas , and  Tennessee  had fewer plantations and rejected secession until the  Fort Sumter  crisis forced them to choose sides. Border states had fewer plantations still and never seceded. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ]  As of 1850 the percentage of Southern whites living in families that owned slaves was 43 percent in the lower South, 36 percent in the upper South and 22 percent in the border states that fought mostly for the Union. [ 38 ]  85 percent of slaveowners who owned 100 or more slaves lived in the lower South, as opposed to one percent in the border states. [ 38 ]  Ninety-five percent of blacks lived in the South, comprising one third of the population there as opposed to one percent of the population of the North. Consequently, fears of eventual emancipation were much greater in the South than in the North. [ 39 ]   Over the 1850s slaves left the  border states  through sale, manumission and escape, and border states also had more free blacks and European immigrants than the lower South, which increased Southern fears that slavery was threatened with rapid extinction in this area. Such fears greatly increased Southern efforts to make  Kansas  a slave state. By 1860 the number of white border state families owning slaves plunged to only 16 percent of the total. Slaves sold to lower South states were owned by a smaller number of wealthy slave owners as the price of slaves increased. [ 40 ]   The Supreme Court decision of 1857 in  Dred Scott v. Sandford  added to the controversy.  Chief Justice   Roger B. Taney's  decision said that slaves were ""so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect"", [ 41 ]  and that slavery could spread into the territories. Lincoln warned that ""the next  Dred Scott  decision"" [ 42 ]  could threaten Northern states with slavery.   Northern politician  Abraham Lincoln  said, ""this question of Slavery was more important than any other; indeed, so much more important has it become that no other national question can even get a hearing just at present."" [ 43 ]  The slavery issue was related to sectional competition for control of the territories, [ 44 ]  and the Southern demand for a  slave code  for the territories was the issue used by Southern politicians to split the Democratic Party in two, which all but guaranteed the election of Lincoln and secession. When secession was an issue, South Carolina planter and state Senator John Townsend said that ""our enemies are about to take possession of the Government, that they intend to rule us according to the caprices of their fanatical theories, and according to the declared purposes of abolishing slavery."" [ 45 ]  Similar opinions were expressed throughout the South in editorials, political speeches and declarations of reasons for secession. Even though Lincoln had no plans to outlaw slavery where it existed, Southerners throughout the South expressed fears for the future of slavery.   Southern concerns included not only economic loss but also fears of racial equality. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ]  The Texas Declaration of Causes for Secession [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  said that the non-slave-holding states were ""proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color"", and that the African race ""were rightfully held and regarded as an inferior and dependent race"". Alabama secessionist E. S. Dargan warned that whites and free blacks could not live together; if slaves were emancipated and remained in the South, we ourselves would become the executioners of our own slaves. To this extent would the policy of our Northern enemies drive us; and thus would we not only be reduced to poverty, but what is still worse, we should be driven to crime, to the commission of sin. [ 52 ]   Beginning in the 1830s, the U.S.  Postmaster General  refused to allow mail which carried abolition pamphlets to the South. [ 53 ]  Northern teachers suspected of any tinge of abolitionism were expelled from the South, and abolitionist literature was banned. Southerners rejected the denials of Republicans that they were abolitionists. [ 54 ]  The North felt threatened as well, for as Eric Foner concludes, ""Northerners came to view slavery as the very antithesis of the good society, as well as a threat to their own fundamental values and interests"".

South Carolina adopted the "" Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union "" on December 24, 1860. It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the  Fugitive Slave Act , claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution. All of the alleged violations of the rights of Southern states were related to slavery.     Secession winter   Before Lincoln took office, seven states had declared their secession from the Union. They established a Southern government, the  Confederate States of America  on February 4, 1861. [ 56 ]  They took control of federal forts and other properties within their boundaries with little resistance from outgoing President  James Buchanan , whose term ended on March 4, 1861. Buchanan said that the  Dred Scott decision  was proof that the South had no reason for secession, and that the Union ""was intended to be perpetual"", but that ""the power by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union"" was not among the ""enumerated powers granted to Congress"". [ 57 ]  One quarter of the U.S. Armythe entire garrison in Texaswas surrendered to state forces by its commanding general,  David E. Twiggs , who then joined the Confederacy.   As Southerners resigned their seats in the Senate and the House, secession later enabled Republicans to pass bills for projects that had been blocked by Southern Senators before the war, including the  Morrill Tariff , land grant colleges (the  Morill Act ), a  Homestead Act , a trans-continental railroad (the  Pacific Railway Acts ), the  National Banking Act  and the authorization of  United States Notes  by the Legal Tender Act of 1862. The  Revenue Act of 1861  introduced the  income tax  to help finance the war.     The Confederacy       Main article:  Confederate States of America       Seven  Deep South  cotton states seceded by February 1861, starting with  South Carolina ,  Mississippi ,  Florida ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Louisiana , and  Texas . These seven states formed the  Confederate States of America  (February 4, 1861), with  Jefferson Davis  as president, and a  governmental structure  closely modeled on the  U.S. Constitution . Following the  attack on Fort Sumter , President Lincoln called for a volunteer army from each state. Within two months, four more Southern slave states declared their secession and joined the Confederacy:  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  North Carolina  and  Tennessee . The northwestern portion of Virginia subsequently seceded from Virginia, joining the Union as the new state of  West Virginia  on June 20, 1863. By the end of 1861,  Missouri  and  Kentucky  were divided  each of them having a pro-Southern and pro-Northern government.     The Union states       Main article:  Union (American Civil War)       Twenty-three states remained loyal to the Union:  California ,  Connecticut ,  Delaware ,  Illinois ,  Indiana ,  Iowa ,  Kansas ,  Kentucky ,  Maine ,  Maryland ,  Massachusetts ,  Michigan ,  Minnesota ,  Missouri ,  New Hampshire ,  New Jersey ,  New York ,  Ohio ,  Oregon ,  Pennsylvania ,  Rhode Island ,  Vermont , and  Wisconsin . During the war,  Nevada  and  West Virginia  joined as new states of the Union.  Tennessee  and  Louisiana  were returned to Union military control early in the war.   The territories of  Colorado ,  Dakota ,  Nebraska ,  Nevada ,  New Mexico ,  Utah , and  Washington  fought on the Union side. Several slave-holding  Native American  tribes supported the Confederacy, giving the  Indian territory  (now  Oklahoma ) a small bloody civil war.     Border states       Main article:  Border states (Civil War)       The border states in the Union were  West Virginia  (which was separated from Virginia and became a new state), and four of the five northernmost slave states ( Maryland ,  Delaware ,  Missouri , and  Kentucky ).   Maryland  had numerous pro-Confederate officials who tolerated anti-Union  rioting in Baltimore  and the burning of bridges. Lincoln responded with  martial law  and called for troops. Militia units that had been drilling in the North rushed toward Washington and Baltimore. [ 58 ]  Before the Confederate government realized what was happening, Lincoln had seized firm control of Maryland (and the separate  District of Columbia ), by arresting all the Maryland government members and holding them without trial.   In Missouri, an  elected convention  on secession voted decisively to remain within the Union. When pro-Confederate Governor  Claiborne F. Jackson  called out the state militia, it was attacked by federal forces under General  Nathaniel Lyon . After the  Camp Jackson Affair  Lyon chased the governor and the rest of the State Guard to the southwestern corner of the state. ( See also:  Missouri secession ). In the resulting vacuum, the convention on secession reconvened and took power as the Unionist provisional government of Missouri. [ 59 ]   Kentucky did not secede; for a time, it declared itself neutral. When Confederate forces entered the state in September, 1861, neutrality ended and the state reaffirmed its loyal status, while trying to maintain slavery. During a brief invasion by Confederate forces, Confederate sympathizers organized a secession convention, inaugurated a governor, and gained recognition from the Confederacy. The rebel government soon went into exile and never controlled Kentucky. [ 60 ]   After Virginia's secession, a Unionist government in Wheeling asked a total of 48 counties to vote on an ordinance to create a new state on Oct. 24, 1861. Returns were received from 41 of the 48 counties, [ 61 ]  and a minority turnout voted heavily in favor of the new state, [ 62 ]  at first called ""Kanawha"" but later renamed ""West Virginia"", which was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863. Jefferson and Berkeley counties were annexed to the new state in late 1863. [ 63 ]  The western counties of Virginia had voted nearly 2 to 1 against secession, though 24 of the 50 counties had voted for secession. [ 64 ]  Soldier numbers from West Virginia were about evenly divided between the Confederacy and the Union. [ 65 ]   Similar Unionist secessions attempts appeared in  East Tennessee , but were suppressed by the Confederacy. Jefferson Davis arrested over 3000 men suspected of being loyal to the Union and held them without trial. [ 66 ]     Overview          A  Roman Catholic  Union army chaplain celebrating a Mass       Over 10,000 military engagements took place during the war, 40% of them in Virginia and Tennessee. [ 67 ]  Since separate articles deal with every major battle and many minor ones, this article only gives the broadest outline. For more information see  List of American Civil War battles  and  Military leadership in the American Civil War .     The war begins       For more details on this topic, see  Battle of Fort Sumter .       Lincoln's victory in the  presidential election of 1860  triggered South Carolina's declaration of secession from the Union. By February 1861, six more Southern states made similar declarations. On February 7, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the  Confederate States of America  and established their temporary capital at  Montgomery ,  Alabama . A pre-war February  Peace Conference of 1861  met in Washington in a failed attempt at resolving the crisis. The remaining eight slave states rejected pleas to join the Confederacy. Confederate forces seized most of the federal forts within their boundaries. President Buchanan protested but made no military response aside from a failed attempt to resupply Fort Sumter via the ship  Star of the West , which was fired upon by South Carolina forces and turned back before it reached the fort. [ 68 ]  However, governors in Massachusetts, New York, and Pennsylvania quietly began buying weapons and training militia units.   On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as President. In his  inaugural address , he argued that the Constitution was a  more perfect union  than the earlier  Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union , that it was a binding contract, and called any secession ""legally void"". [ 69 ]  He stated he had no intent to invade Southern states, nor did he intend to end slavery where it existed, but that he would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union. [ 70 ]   The South sent delegations to Washington and offered to pay for the federal properties and enter into a peace treaty with the United States. Lincoln rejected any negotiations with Confederate agents on the grounds that the Confederacy was not a legitimate government, and that making any treaty with it would be tantamount to recognition of it as a sovereign government. [ 71 ]  However, Secretary of State William Seward engaged in unauthorized and indirect negotiations that failed. [ 71 ]   Fort Sumter  in Charleston, South Carolina,  Fort Monroe ,  Fort Pickens  and  Fort Taylor  were the remaining Union-held forts in the Confederacy, and Lincoln was determined to hold Fort Sumter. Under orders from Confederate President  Jefferson Davis , troops controlled by the Confederate government under  P. G. T. Beauregard  bombarded the fort with artillery on April 12, forcing the fort's capitulation. Northerners rallied behind Lincoln's call for all of the states to send troops to recapture the forts and to preserve the Union. With the scale of the rebellion apparently small so far, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers for 90 days. [ 72 ]  For months before that, several Northern governors had discreetly readied their state militias; they began to move forces the next day. [ 73 ]   Liberty Arsenal  in  Liberty, Missouri  was seized eight days after Fort Sumter.   Four states in the upper South (Tennessee, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Virginia), which had repeatedly rejected Confederate overtures, now refused to send forces against their neighbors, declared their secession, and joined the Confederacy. To reward Virginia, the Confederate capital was moved to  Richmond . [ 74 ]  The city was the symbol of the Confederacy. Richmond was in a highly vulnerable location at the end of a tortuous Confederate supply line. Although Richmond was heavily fortified, supplies for the city would be reduced by Sherman's capture of  Atlanta  and cut off almost entirely when Grant besieged  Petersburg  and its railroads that supplied the Southern capital.     Anaconda Plan and blockade, 1861       Main articles:  Naval battles of the American Civil War ,  Union blockade , and  Confederate States Navy              1861 cartoon of Scott's "" Anaconda Plan ""       Winfield Scott , the commanding general of the U.S. Army, devised the  Anaconda Plan [ 75 ]  to win the war with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a  Union blockade  of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan, but overruled Scott's warnings against an immediate attack on Richmond.   In May 1861, Lincoln enacted the Union blockade of all Southern ports, ending regular international shipments to the Confederacy. When violators' ships and cargoes were seized, they were sold and the proceeds given to Union sailors, but the British crews were released. By late 1861, the blockade stopped most local port-to-port traffic. The blockade shut down  King Cotton , ruining the Southern economy. British investors built small, fast "" blockade runners "" that traded arms and luxuries brought in from  Bermuda ,  Cuba  and the  Bahamas  in return for high-priced cotton and tobacco. [ 76 ]  Shortages of food and other goods triggered by the blockade, foraging by Northern armies, and the impressment of crops by Confederate armies combined to cause  hyperinflation  and bread riots in the South. [ 77 ]   On March 8, 1862, the  Confederate Navy  waged a fight against the  Union Navy  when the  ironclad   CSS  Virginia  attacked the blockade; against wooden ships she seemed unstoppable but the next day she had to fight the new Union warship  USS  Monitor  in the  Battle of the Ironclads . [ 78 ]  The battle ended in a draw, which was a strategic victory for the Union in that the blockade was sustained. The Confederacy lost the  Virginia  when the ship was scuttled to prevent capture, and the Union built many copies of  Monitor . Lacking the technology to build effective warships, the Confederacy attempted to obtain warships from Britain. The Union victory at the  Second Battle of Fort Fisher  in January 1865 closed the last useful Southern port and virtually ended blockade running.     Eastern Theater 18611863       For more details on this topic, see  Eastern Theater of the American Civil War .              A Union Regimental Fife and Drum Corps       Because of the fierce resistance of a few initial Confederate forces at  Manassas ,  Virginia , in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of  Maj. Gen.   Irvin McDowell  on the Confederate forces there was halted in the  First Battle of Bull Run , or  First Manassas , [ 79 ]  whereupon they were forced back to  Washington, D.C. , by Confederate troops under the command of Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  P. G. T. Beauregard . It was in this battle that Confederate General  Thomas Jackson  received the  nickname  of ""Stonewall"" because he stood like a stone wall against Union troops. [ 80 ]  Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the  U.S. Congress  passed the  Crittenden-Johnson Resolution  on July 25 of that year, which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end slavery.   Maj. Gen.  George B. McClellan  took command of the Union  Army of the Potomac  on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen.  Henry W. Halleck ), and the war began in earnest in 1862. Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the  peninsula  between the  York River  and  James River , southeast of Richmond. Although McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the  Peninsula Campaign , [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ]   Johnston  halted his advance at the  Battle of Seven Pines , then General  Robert E. Lee  and top subordinates  James Longstreet  and Stonewall Jackson [ 84 ]  defeated McClellan in the  Seven Days Battles  and forced his retreat. The  Northern Virginia Campaign , which included the  Second Battle of Bull Run , ended in yet another victory for the South. [ 85 ]  McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to  John Pope's  Union  Army of Virginia , which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.   Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 45,000 men of the  Army of Northern Virginia  across the  Potomac River  into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the  Battle of Antietam [ 84 ]  near  Sharpsburg ,  Maryland , on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history. [ 86 ]  Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided an opportunity for Lincoln to announce his  Emancipation Proclamation . [ 87 ]          Confederate dead behind the stone wall of Marye's Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia, killed during the Battle of Chancellorsville, May 1863       When the cautious McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Ambrose Burnside . Burnside was soon defeated at the  Battle of Fredericksburg [ 88 ]  on December 13, 1862, when over twelve thousand Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen.  Joseph Hooker . Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, he was humiliated in the  Battle of Chancellorsville [ 89 ]  in May 1863. He was replaced by Maj. Gen.  George Meade  during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the  Battle of Gettysburg [ 90 ]  (July 1 to July 3, 1863), the bloodiest battle of the war, which is sometimes considered the war's  turning point .  Pickett's Charge  on July 3 is often recalled as the  high-water mark of the Confederacy , not just because it signaled the end of Lee's plan to pressure Washington from the north, but also because Vicksburg, Mississippi, the key stronghold to control of the Mississippi, fell the following day. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000). [ 91 ]  However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat, and after Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln decided to turn to the Western Theater for new leadership.     Western Theater 18611863       For more details on this topic, see  Western Theater of the American Civil War .       While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they were defeated many times in the West. They were driven from Missouri early in the war as a result of the  Battle of Pea Ridge . [ 92 ]   Leonidas Polk 's invasion of  Columbus ,  Kentucky  ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned that state against the Confederacy.   Nashville ,  Tennessee , fell to the Union early in 1862. Most of the  Mississippi  was opened with the taking of  Island No. 10  and  New Madrid ,  Missouri , and then  Memphis ,  Tennessee . The  Union Navy  captured  New Orleans [ 93 ]  without a major fight in May 1862, allowing the Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi as well. Only the fortress city of  Vicksburg ,  Mississippi , prevented unchallenged Union control of the entire river.   General  Braxton Bragg 's second Confederate invasion of Kentucky ended with a meaningless victory over Maj. Gen.  Don Carlos Buell  at the  Battle of Perryville , [ 94 ]  although Bragg was forced to end his attempt at liberating Kentucky and retreat due to lack of support for the Confederacy in that state. Bragg was narrowly defeated by Maj. Gen.  William Rosecrans  at the  Battle of Stones River [ 95 ]  in  Tennessee .   The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the  Battle of Chickamauga . Bragg, reinforced by Lt. Gen.  James Longstreet 's corps (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans, despite the heroic defensive stand of Maj. Gen.  George Henry Thomas . Rosecrans retreated to  Chattanooga , which Bragg then besieged.   The Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was  Ulysses S. Grant , who won victories at Forts  Henry  and  Donelson  (by which the Union seized control of the  Tennessee  and  Cumberland  Rivers);  the Battle of Shiloh ; [ 96 ]  and the  Battle of Vicksburg , [ 97 ]  which cemented Union control of the Mississippi River and is considered one of the  turning points  of the war. Grant marched to the relief of Rosecrans and defeated Bragg at the  Third Battle of Chattanooga , [ 98 ]  driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee and opening a route to Atlanta and the heart of the Confederacy.     Trans-Mississippi Theater 18611865       For more details on this topic, see  Trans-Mississippi Theater of the American Civil War .       Guerrilla  activity turned much of Missouri into a battleground. Missouri had, in total, the third-most battles of any state during the war. [ 99 ]  The other states of the west, though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, saw numerous small-scale military actions. Battles in the region served to secure  Missouri ,  Indian Territory ,  New Mexico Territory , and  Arizona Territory  for the Union. Confederate incursions into Arizona and New Mexico territories were repulsed in 1862 and a Union campaign to secure Indian Territory succeeded in 1863. Late in the war, the Union's  Red River Campaign  was a failure. Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war, but was cut off from the rest of the Confederacy after the capture of Vicksburg in 1863 gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.     End of the war 18641865           Jefferson Davis , first and only President of the  Confederate States of America       At the beginning of 1864, Lincoln made Grant commander of all Union armies. Grant made his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac, and put Maj. Gen.  William Tecumseh Sherman  in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of  total war  and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. [ 100 ]  This was total war not in terms of killing civilians but rather in terms of destroying homes, farms and railroad tracks. Grant devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the entire Confederacy from multiple directions: Generals George Meade and  Benjamin Butler  were ordered to move against Lee near Richmond; General  Franz Sigel  (and later  Philip Sheridan ) were to  attack the Shenandoah Valley ; General Sherman was to capture  Atlanta  and march to the sea (the Atlantic Ocean); Generals  George Crook  and  William W. Averell  were to operate against railroad supply lines in  West Virginia ; and Maj. Gen.  Nathaniel P. Banks  was to capture  Mobile ,  Alabama .   Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase (""Grant's  Overland Campaign "") of the Eastern campaign. Grant's  battles of attrition  at the  Wilderness ,  Spotsylvania , and  Cold Harbor [ 101 ]  resulted in heavy Union losses, but forced Lee's Confederates to fall back again and again. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the  Bermuda Hundred  river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 65,000 casualties in seven weeks), [ 102 ]  kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. He pinned down the Confederate army in the  Siege of Petersburg , where the two armies engaged in  trench warfare  for over nine months.   Grant finally found a commander, General  Philip Sheridan , aggressive enough to prevail in the  Valley Campaigns of 1864 . Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen.  Jubal A. Early  in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at  the Battle of Cedar Creek . Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the  Shenandoah Valley , [ 103 ]  a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.   Meanwhile, Sherman marched from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals  Joseph E. Johnston  and  John Bell Hood  along the way.  The fall of Atlanta , [ 104 ]  on September 2, 1864, was a significant factor in the reelection of Lincoln as president. [ 105 ]  Hood left the Atlanta area to menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the  Franklin-Nashville Campaign . [ 106 ]  Union Maj. Gen.  John M. Schofield  defeated Hood at  the Battle of Franklin , and  George H. Thomas  dealt Hood a massive defeat at  the Battle of Nashville , effectively destroying Hood's army.          A dead soldier in Petersburg, Virginia 1865, photographed by  Thomas C. Roche .       Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20% of the farms in Georgia in his "" March to the Sea "". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at  Savannah ,  Georgia  in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, [ 107 ]  increasing the pressure on Lee's army.   Lee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. Union forces won a decisive victory at the  Battle of Five Forks  on April 1, forcing Lee to evacuate Petersburg and Richmond. The Confederate capital fell [ 108 ]  to the  Union XXV Corps , composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west and after a defeat at  Sayler's Creek , it became clear to Robert E. Lee that continued fighting against the United States was both tactically and logistically impossible.     Confederate Surrenders       Main article:  Conclusion of the American Civil War       Lee surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, at the  McLean House  in the  village of Appomattox Court House . [ 109 ]  In an untraditional gesture and as a sign of Grant's respect and anticipation of peacefully folding the Confederacy back into the Union, Lee was permitted to keep his officer's saber and his horse,  Traveller . On April 14, 1865,  Lincoln was shot .  Andrew Johnson  became President when Lincoln died the next day.   Events leading to Lee's surrender began with the capture of key Confederate officers  Richard S. Ewell  and  Richard H. Anderson  on April 6, following Confederate defeat at the  battle of Sayler's Creek . On April 8 Union cavalry under Major General  George Armstrong Custer  destroyed three trains of Confederate supplies at  Appomattox Station , leading to the surrender of General Lee the next day. [ 110 ]  General  St. John Richardson Liddell 's army surrendered after the loss of the Confederate fortifications at the  Battle of Spanish Fort  in Alabama, also on April 9.   On April 21  John S. Mosby s raiders of the  43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry  disbanded and on April 26 General  Joseph E. Johnston  surrendered to  Major General   William Sherman  at  Bennett Place . Surrendering on May 4 and 5 were the Confederate departments of Alabama, Mississippi and East Louisiana regiments and the District of the Gulf. The Confederate President was captured on May 10 and the surrender of the Department of Florida and South Georgia happened the same day. Confederate Brigadier General  ""Jeff"" Meriwether Thompson  surrendered his brigade the next day and the day following saw the surrender of the Confederate forces of North Georgia. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman on April 26, 1865, in  Durham ,  North Carolina .   On June 23, 1865, at  Fort Towson  in the Choctaw Nations' area of the  Oklahoma Territory ,  Stand Watie  signed a cease-fire agreement with Union representatives, becoming the last Confederate general in the field to stand down. The last Confederate ship to surrender was the  CSS  Shenandoah , on November 6, 1865, in  Liverpool ,  England . These surrenders marked the  conclusion of the American Civil War .     Slavery during the war       Main article:  Slavery in the United States       At the beginning of the war some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves ""...cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union."" [ 111 ]  The same Congressmanand his fellow Radical Republicansput pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans came to accept gradual, compensated emancipation and colonization. [ 112 ]   Copperheads , the  border states  and  War Democrats  opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of  total war  needed to save the Union.   In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that ""to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game."" [ 113 ]  At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War  Simon Cameron  and Generals  John C. Frmont  (in Missouri) and  David Hunter  (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) in order to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.   Lincoln warned the border states that a more radical type of emancipation would happen if his gradual plan based on compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization was rejected. [ 114 ]  Only the District of Columbia accepted Lincoln's gradual plan, and Lincoln mentioned his Emancipation Proclamation to members of his cabinet on July 21, 1862. Secretary of State  William H. Seward  told Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like ""our last shriek on the retreat"". [ 115 ]  In September 1862 the  Battle of Antietam  provided this opportunity, and the subsequent  War Governors' Conference  added support for the proclamation. [ 116 ]  Lincoln had already published a letter [ 117 ]  encouraging the border states especially to accept emancipation as necessary to save the Union. Lincoln later said that slavery was ""somehow the cause of the war"". [ 118 ]  Lincoln issued his preliminary  Emancipation Proclamation  on September 22, 1862, and his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that ""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong ... And yet I have never understood that the Presidency conferred upon me an unrestricted right to act officially upon this judgment and feeling ... I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me."" [ 119 ]   Since the Emancipation Proclamation was based on the President's war powers, it only included territory held by Confederates at the time. However, the Proclamation became a symbol of the Union's growing commitment to add emancipation to the Union's definition of liberty. [ 120 ]  Lincoln also played a leading role in getting Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, [ 121 ]  which made emancipation universal and permanent.   Enslaved African Americans did not wait for Lincoln's action before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, nearly 200,000 African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves.   Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the  Fort Pillow Massacre . [ 122 ]  This led to a breakdown of the prisoner exchange program [ 123 ]  and the growth of prison camps such as  Andersonville prison  in Georgia, where almost 13,000 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease. [ 124 ]   In spite of the South's shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As  Howell Cobb  said, ""If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong."" Confederate generals  Patrick Cleburne  and  Robert E. Lee  argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and  Jefferson Davis  was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at  Appomattox  before this plan could be implemented. [ 125 ]   The Emancipation Proclamation [ 126 ]  greatly reduced the Confederacy's hope of getting aid from Britain or France. Lincoln's moderate approach succeeded in getting border states, War Democrats and emancipated slaves fighting on the same side for the Union. The Union-controlled border states (Kentucky, Missouri, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia) were not covered by the Emancipation Proclamation. All abolished slavery on their own, except Kentucky and Delaware. [ 127 ]  The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved South. The  13th amendment , [ 128 ]  ratified December 6, 1865, finally freed the remaining slaves in Kentucky, Delaware, and New Jersey, that numbered 225,000 for Kentucky, 1,800 in Delaware, and 18 in New Jersey as of 1860. [ 129 ]     Threat of international intervention       Main article:  Britain in the American Civil War       Entry into the war by Britain and France on behalf of the Confederacy would have greatly increased the South's chances of winning independence from the Union. [ 130 ]  The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State  William H. Seward  worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America (none ever did). In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war in order to get cotton.  Cotton diplomacy  proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 186062 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It was said that ""King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton"", as US grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half. [ 131 ]   When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, iron workers, and British ships to transport weapons. [ 132 ]   Charles Francis Adams  proved particularly adept as  minister  to Britain for the U.S. and Britain was reluctant to boldly challenge the blockade. The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial ship builders in Britain. The most famous, the  CSS  Alabama , did considerable damage and led to serious  postwar disputes . However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for European politicians, especially in Britain. War loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the  Trent Affair , involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of a British mail steamer to seize two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two.   In 1862, the British considered mediationthough even such an offer would have risked war with the U.S.  Lord Palmerston  reportedly read  Uncle Toms Cabin  three times [ 133 ]  when deciding on this. The Union victory in the  Battle of Antietam  caused them to delay this decision. The  Emancipation Proclamation  further reinforced the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's own  seizure of Mexico  ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris.     Victory and aftermath   Historians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars emphasize that the Union held an insurmountable long-term advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. Confederate actions, they argue, only delayed defeat. Southern historian  Shelby Foote  expressed this view succinctly: ""I think that the North fought that war with one hand behind its back...If there had been more Southern victories, and a lot more, the North simply would have brought that other hand out from behind its back. I don't think the South ever had a chance to win that War."" [ 134 ]  The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had succeeded in getting the support of the border states, War Democrats, emancipated slaves and Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the  Copperheads  and their peace platform. [ 135 ]  Lincoln had also found military leaders like Grant and Sherman who would press the Union's numerical advantage in battle over the Confederate Armies. Generals who did not shy from bloodshed won the war, and from the end of 1864 onward there was no hope for the South.   On the other hand,  James McPherson  has argued that the Norths advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely, but not inevitable. Confederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory in order to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies in order to win. [ 136 ]   Also important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. Although Lincoln's approach to emancipation was slow, the Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers. [ 137 ]     Comparison of Union and CSA [ 138 ]       Union   CSA       Total population   22,000,000 (71%)   9,000,000 (29%)       Free population   21,567,414   5,500,000       1860 Border state slaves   432,586   NA       1860 Southern slaves   NA   3,500,000       Soldiers   2,200,000 (67%)   1,064,000 (33%)       Railroad miles   21,788 (71%)   8,838 (29%)       Manufactured items   90%   10%       Firearm production   97%   3%       Bales of cotton in 1860   Negligible   4,500,000       Bales of cotton in 1864   Negligible   300,000       Pre-war U.S. exports   30%   70%       The more industrialized economy of the North aided in the production of arms, munitions and supplies, as well as finances, and transportation. The table shows the relative advantage of the Union over the Confederate States of America (CSA) at the start of the war. The advantages widened rapidly during the war, as the Northern economy grew, and Confederate territory shrank and its economy weakened. The Union population was 22 million and the South 9 million in 1861; the Southern population included more than 3.5 million slaves and about 5.5 million whites, thus leaving the South's white population outnumbered by a ratio of more than four to one compared with that of the North. [ 139 ]  The disparity grew as the Union controlled more and more southern territory with garrisons, and cut off the trans-Mississippi part of the Confederacy. The Union at the start controlled over 80% of the shipyards, steamships, river boats, and the Navy. It augmented these by a massive shipbuilding program. This enabled the Union to control the river systems and to blockade the entire southern coastline. [ 140 ]  Excellent railroad links between Union cities allowed for the quick and cheap movement of troops and supplies. Transportation was much slower and more difficult in the South which was unable to augment its much smaller rail system, repair damage, or even perform routine maintenance. [ 141 ]  The failure of Davis to maintain positive and productive relationships with state governors (especially governor  Joseph E. Brown  of Georgia and governor  Zebulon Baird Vance  of North Carolina) damaged his ability to draw on regional resources. [ 142 ]  The Confederacy's "" King Cotton "" misperception of the world economy led to bad diplomacy, such as the refusal to ship cotton before the blockade started. [ 143 ]  The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African-Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, [ 144 ]  further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery. Emancipated slaves mostly handled garrison duties, and fought numerous battles in 1864-65. [ 145 ]  European  immigrants  joined the  Union Army  in large numbers, including 177,000 born in Germany and 144,000 born in Ireland. [ 146 ]     Reconstruction       Main article:  Reconstruction era of the United States       Northern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. It had to encompass the two war goals: secession had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery had to be eliminated. They disagreed sharply on the criteria for these goals. They also disagreed on the degree of federal control, that should be imposed on the South and the process by which Southern states should be reintegrated into the Union.   Reconstruction, which began early in the war and ended in 1877, involved a complex and rapidly changing series of federal and state policies. The long-term result came in the three  Reconstruction Amendments  to the  Constitution : the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery; the Fourteenth Amendment, which extended federal legal protections equally to citizens regardless of race; and the Fifteenth Amendment, which abolished racial restrictions on voting. Reconstruction ended in the different states at different times, the last three by the  Compromise of 1877 .   For further details on how whites in the South subverted the protections of the  Fourteenth  and  Fifteenth Amendments , see:     Reconstruction era of the United States [ 147 ]   Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)   African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)   Jim Crow laws   United States v. Cruikshank  (1875)   Civil Rights Cases  (1883)   Plessy v. Ferguson  (1896)   Williams v. Mississippi  (1898)   Giles v. Harris  (1903)   Redemption (United States history)       Results          Monument in honor of the  Grand Army of the Republic , organized after the war.       Slavery effectively ended in the U.S. in the spring of 1865 when the Confederate armies surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, which stipulated that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union-controlled parts of the South were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the  Thirteenth Amendment . The full restoration of the Union was the work of a highly contentious postwar era known as  Reconstruction . The war produced about 1,030,000 casualties (3% of the population), including about 620,000 soldier deathstwo-thirds by disease. [ 148 ]  The war accounted for more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined. [ 149 ]  The  causes of the war , the reasons for its outcome, and even  the name of the war itself  are subjects of lingering controversy today. About 4 million  black   slaves  were freed in 1861-65. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all  white  males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and an extraordinary 18% in the South. [ 150 ]   One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the use of Napoleonic tactics such as charges. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels,  Mini balls  and (near the end of the war for the Union army) repeating firearms such as the  Spencer repeating rifle  and a few experimental  Gatling guns , soldiers were decimated when standing in lines in the open. This gave birth to  trench warfare , a tactic heavily used during  World War I .

Curry: The Perils and Duty of the South - Speech Delivered in Talladega, Alabama, November 26, 1860 - This was one of many Southern states' rights arguments for defending slavery.   ^  Lincoln's Speech in Chicago, December 10, 1856 in which he said, ""We shall again be able not to declare, that 'all States as States, are equal,' nor yet that 'all citizens as citizens are equal,' but to renew the broader, better declaration, including both these and much more, that 'all men are created equal.'""; Also, Lincoln's Letter to Henry L. Pierce, April 6, 1859   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia - Stephens said: 'African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization ... was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right.'   ^  From Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone Speech, March 21, 1861, The Athenaeum, Savannah Georgia The larger Stephens quote, for more context, is as follows: 'The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution -- African slavery as it exists amongst us -- the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the ""rock upon which the old Union would split."" He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the ""storm came and the wind blew."" Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner- stone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery -- subordination to the superior race -- is his natural and normal condition. [Applause.] '   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 152-153 ( Cornerstone Speech ). Stampp said Stephens' Cornerstone Speech ""was in striking contrast to his postwar constitutional interpretation.""   ^  a   b  Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 6365 ( A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States ) Stampp used the following quote to illustrate the fact that, after Confederate defeat, Stephens argued that the war was caused not by slavery but by states' rights controversies: ""It is a postulate, with many writers of this day, that the late War was the result of two opposing ideas, or principles, upon the subject of African Slavery. Between these, according to their theory, sprung the 'irrepressible conflict,' in principle, which ended in the terrible conflict in arms. Those who assume this postulate, and so theorize upon it, are but superficial observers. That the war had its origin in opposing principles, which in their action upon the conduct of men, produced the ultimate conflict of arms, may be assumed as an unquestionable fact. But the opposing principles which produced these results in physical action were of a very different character from those assumed in the postulate. They lay in the organic Structure of the Government of the States ... between the supporters of a strictly Federative Government, on the one side, and a thoroughly National one, on the other.""   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge page 4. McPherson writes, ""After the war, however, Davis and Stephens changed their tune. By the time they wrote their histories of the Confederacy, slavery was gone with the wind -- a dead and discredited institution. To concede that the Confederacy had broken up the United States and launched a war that killed 620,000 Americans in a vain attempt to keep four million people in bondage would not confer honor on their lost cause.   ^  James McPherson, This Mighty Scourge, pages 3-9. Speaking of alternative explanations for secession, McPherson writes (p. 7), ""While one or more of these interpretations remain popular among the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other Southern heritage groups, few professional historians now subscribe to them. Of all these interpretations, the state's-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, state's rights for what purpose? State's rights, or sovereignty, was always more a means than an end, an instrument to achieve a certain goal more than a principle.   ^  Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852-1857, pages 267269   ^  Freehling,  Prelude to Civil War,  page 297; Willentz page 388 - On March 13, 1833, Rhett said, ""A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands... Every stride of this Government, over your rights, brings it nearer and nearer to your peculiar policy. ... The whole world are in arms against your institutions  Let Gentlemen not be deceived. It is not the Tariff  not Internal Improvement  nor yet the Force bill, which constitutes the great evil against which we are contending... These are but the forms in which the despotic nature of the government is evinced  but it is the despotism which constitutes the evil: and until this Government is made a limited Government... there is no liberty  no security for the South.""   ^  As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened: ""I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness."" - Ellis, Richard E.

Ellis further notes that ""Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states rights. At various points in their careers,  John Taylor ,  John Randolph , and  Nathaniel Macon  had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners wishes.""   ^  John Niven, John C. Calhoun and the Price of Union, page 197 - The author said the following about Calhoun's description of the tariff issue: ""Finally, the root of the nullification crisis was exposed. What had begun as a reaction to a depression in the cotton states, a slump that had been particularly severe in South Carolina, had rapidly resolved itself into an all-encompassing fear on the part of a majority of the planter elite class that the growing industrialization of the North, expressing itself politically through the majority will, would eventually demand emancipation, heedless of the social consequences.""   ^  William E.

Brewster, a  Republican , was solidly  conservative , a close confidant of  Joseph McCarthy  of  Wisconsin  and antagonist of  Howard Hughes .

Bridges. He graduated  summa cum laude  from  Bowdoin College  in 1909, a member of the  Phi Beta Kappa Society  and  Delta Kappa Epsilon . From 1909 to 1910, Brewster was the principal of Castine High School, and then attended  Harvard Law School , graduating in 1913.     [ edit ]   Early political career   In 1915, he married Dorothy Foss; from 1915 to 1923, he was a member of the Portland School Committee. From 1914 to 1925, Brewster was a lawyer for the Chapman and Brewster  law firm  in  Portland . He was elected to a two-year term as a member of the  Maine House of Representatives  (191718), but resigned to enlist in the  U.S. Army  (Third Infantry unit of the Maine National Guard) when the nation entered  World War I . Brewster served successively as  private ,  second lieutenant ,  captain , and regimental adjutant, and returned to the State House after the war ended. He continued to be a state House member from 1921 to 1922, when he was elected to the  Maine Senate .   Brewster served in the State Senate until 1925, when he became the  Governor of Maine . Brewster served two terms as Governor, leaving office in 1929, losing the Republican nomination for a third term. In 1932, he was defeated for a seat in the  U.S. House of Representatives , but was elected from the Third District in 1935 and served until 1941, when he went on to the  U.S. Senate . Brewster was re-elected in 1946.     [ edit ]   Congressional career   During his time in Congress, Brewster worked on legislation to provide old-age pensions (the forerunner of Social Security) although he was a prominent opponent of welfare and spending programs in  President   Roosevelt's   New Deal . As Senator, Brewster sat on several Senate committees, notably the Special Senate Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (the Truman Committee), and the Joint Committee to Investigate the Pearl Harbor Attack. At the time these were very high profile and Brewster's work on those committees did much to raise his profile in Washington.   In the Senate, he was good friends with  Joseph McCarthy  of  Wisconsin . His association with  McCarthyism  eroded Brewster's political support as McCarthy's  anti-communist  excesses became increasingly unpopular. His association with the  Ku Klux Klan  also cost him support in  liberal  Republican circles.     [ edit ]   Opposition to Howard Hughes   Brewster came to national attention due to his opposition to the commercial interests of  Howard Hughes , America's wealthiest man at the time. Brewster was chairman of a special Senate committee investigating defense procurement during  World War II . He claimed concern that Hughes had received $40 million from the  Defense Department  without actually delivering the aircraft he had contracted to provide, but Brewster may have had an ulterior motive. Incidentally, Hughes stated that the H-4 Hercules cost far more, with the balance coming from his own funds.   Hughes aggressively combated the inquirer, alleging corruption. Memoirs by Hughes right-hand man  Noah Dietrich  and syndicated newspaper columnist  Jack Anderson  each sketched Brewster as, in Dietrich's words, ""an errand boy for  Juan Trippe  and  Pan American World Airways ,"" who pushed for legislation that would give Pan Am the single-carrier international air  monopoly  for the U.S. The  Martin Scorsese  movie  The Aviator  portrays Brewster (played by  Alan Alda ) similarly, as corrupt and in the pocket of Pan Am, the rival of Hughes'  TWA . Hughes spread rumors about Brewster's close association with Pan Am, alleging that he received free flights and hospitality in return for legislation such as his bill to withdraw government approval for TWA flights across the Atlantic.   In a Senate hearing that electrified the nation, Hughes repeated his accusations that Brewster had promised an end to the Senate inquiry if Hughes would agree to merging TWA with Pan Am. (Dietrich wrote that Hughes, in a bid to stall for time before the hearing, went so far as to launch negotiations with Trippe about such a merger.) In response, Brewster, stung by the allegations, stood aside from chairing the inquiry and became instead a witness before the committee  which also allowed Hughes to question Brewster directly. Brewster denied Hughes' allegations and made several counter-claims, but by the time the hearing ended Brewster's reputation had suffered greatly. Paradoxically, Hughes, for all his wealth, came across as what Dietrich described as the ""little guy"" who ""fought City Hall and won."" [ 1 ]   In 1952, Hughes worked hard to ensure Brewster's political demise, persuading the then Governor of Maine,  Frederick G. Payne , to challenge him for the Republican Senate nomination. Armed with practically unlimited campaign funds from Hughes, Payne challenged Brewster's connection with McCarthyism and  racist  groups, and also took up Hughes' claims that Brewster was corrupt. This led to the unusual defeat of an incumbent Senator in his own  primary ; Payne would only last one term, being defeated by  Ed Muskie  in 1958.     [ edit ]   Retirement and later years   In his retirement Brewster continued active involvement in many conservative organizations. Brewster was a  Christian Scientist . He was a member of the  American Bar Association ,  Grange , the  American Legion , the  Freemasons , the  Elks , the  Odd Fellows , and  Delta Kappa Epsilon . He denied being a member of the  Ku Klux Klan , although he received their support.   Brewster died unexpectedly of  cancer  in 1961 in  Brookline ,  Massachusetts . He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in  Dexter, Maine  where his home was converted to the Brewster Inn, a  bed and breakfast .     [ edit ]   Popular culture   In 2004, Brewster was portrayed by  Alan Alda  in  The Aviator , a performance for which Alda was nominated for an  Oscar .

Bridges. He graduated  summa cum laude  from  Bowdoin College  in 1909, a member of the  Phi Beta Kappa Society  and  Delta Kappa Epsilon . From 1909 to 1910, Brewster was the principal of Castine High School, and then attended  Harvard Law School , graduating in 1913.     [ edit ]   Early political career   In 1915, he married Dorothy Foss; from 1915 to 1923, he was a member of the Portland School Committee. From 1914 to 1925, Brewster was a lawyer for the Chapman and Brewster  law firm  in  Portland . He was elected to a two-year term as a member of the  Maine House of Representatives  (191718), but resigned to enlist in the  U.S. Army  (Third Infantry unit of the Maine National Guard) when the nation entered  World War I . Brewster served successively as  private ,  second lieutenant ,  captain , and regimental adjutant, and returned to the State House after the war ended. He continued to be a state House member from 1921 to 1922, when he was elected to the  Maine Senate .   Brewster served in the State Senate until 1925, when he became the  Governor of Maine . Brewster served two terms as Governor, leaving office in 1929, losing the Republican nomination for a third term. In 1932, he was defeated for a seat in the  U.S. House of Representatives , but was elected from the Third District in 1935 and served until 1941, when he went on to the  U.S. Senate . Brewster was re-elected in 1946.     [ edit ]   Congressional career   During his time in Congress, Brewster worked on legislation to provide old-age pensions (the forerunner of Social Security) although he was a prominent opponent of welfare and spending programs in  President   Roosevelt's   New Deal . As Senator, Brewster sat on several Senate committees, notably the Special Senate Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program (the Truman Committee), and the Joint Committee to Investigate the Pearl Harbor Attack. At the time these were very high profile and Brewster's work on those committees did much to raise his profile in Washington.   In the Senate, he was good friends with  Joseph McCarthy  of  Wisconsin . His association with  McCarthyism  eroded Brewster's political support as McCarthy's  anti-communist  excesses became increasingly unpopular. His association with the  Ku Klux Klan  also cost him support in  liberal  Republican circles.     [ edit ]   Opposition to Howard Hughes   Brewster came to national attention due to his opposition to the commercial interests of  Howard Hughes , America's wealthiest person at the time. Brewster was chairman of a special Senate committee investigating defense procurement during  World War II . He claimed concern that Hughes had received $40 million from the  Defense Department  without actually delivering the aircraft he had contracted to provide, but Brewster may have had an ulterior motive. Incidentally, Hughes stated that the H-4 Hercules cost far more, with the balance coming from his own funds.   Hughes aggressively combated the inquirer, alleging corruption. Memoirs by Hughes right-hand man  Noah Dietrich  and syndicated newspaper columnist  Jack Anderson  each sketched Brewster as, in Dietrich's words, ""an errand boy for  Juan Trippe  and  Pan American World Airways ,"" who pushed for legislation that would give Pan Am the single-carrier international air  monopoly  for the U.S. The  Martin Scorsese  movie  The Aviator  portrays Brewster (played by  Alan Alda ) similarly, as corrupt and in the pocket of Pan Am, the rival of Hughes'  TWA . Hughes spread rumors about Brewster's close association with Pan Am, alleging that he received free flights and hospitality in return for legislation such as his bill to withdraw government approval for TWA flights across the Atlantic.   In a Senate hearing that electrified the nation, Hughes repeated his accusations that Brewster had promised an end to the Senate inquiry if Hughes would agree to merging TWA with Pan Am. (Dietrich wrote that Hughes, in a bid to stall for time before the hearing, went so far as to launch negotiations with Trippe about such a merger.) In response, Brewster, stung by the allegations, stood aside from chairing the inquiry and became instead a witness before the committee  which also allowed Hughes to question Brewster directly. Brewster denied Hughes' allegations and made several counter-claims, but by the time the hearing ended Brewster's reputation had suffered greatly. Paradoxically, Hughes, for all his wealth, came across as what Dietrich described as the ""little guy"" who ""fought City Hall and won."" [ 1 ]   In 1952, Hughes worked hard to ensure Brewster's political demise, persuading the then Governor of Maine,  Frederick G. Payne , to challenge him for the Republican Senate nomination. Armed with practically unlimited campaign funds from Hughes, Payne challenged Brewster's connection with McCarthyism and  racist  groups, and also took up Hughes' claims that Brewster was corrupt. This led to the unusual defeat of an incumbent Senator in his own  primary ; Payne would only last one term, being defeated by  Ed Muskie  in 1958.     [ edit ]   Retirement and later years   In his retirement Brewster continued active involvement in many conservative organizations. Brewster was a  Christian Scientist . He was a member of the  American Bar Association ,  Grange , the  American Legion , the  Freemasons , the  Elks , the  Odd Fellows , and  Delta Kappa Epsilon . He denied being a member of the  Ku Klux Klan , although he received their support.   Brewster died unexpectedly of  cancer  in 1961 in  Brookline ,  Massachusetts . He was buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in  Dexter, Maine  where his home was converted to the Brewster Inn, a  bed and breakfast .     [ edit ]   Popular culture   In 2004, Brewster was portrayed by  Alan Alda  in  The Aviator , a performance for which Alda was nominated for an  Oscar .

Under the  U.S. Constitution , the U.S. president serves a four-year term and (starting when the inauguration of  Dwight Eisenhower  brought  its twenty-second amendment  into full force) may be re-elected only once.    Upon entering office, the President must repeat the following oath or affirmation;  ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability; preserve, protect, and defend, the Constitution of the United States"" . The oath is traditionaly ended with ""So help me God"".  As the most powerful person in the United States, a  democratic   republic  and currently the world's only  superpower , the President is sometimes referred to as ""the leader of the free world,"" though this designation was more common during the  Cold War .  In government jargon, the President of the United States has been called since the  Truman   Administration  by the acronym  POTUS .  The wife of the President is traditionally referred to as the  First Lady  (govt. jargon:  FLOTUS ).

The president, the  Constitution  says, must ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed."" To carry out this responsibility, the president presides over the executive branch of the federal government — a vast organization numbering about 4 million people, including 1 million active-duty military personnel. In addition, the president has important  legislative  and  judicial  powers.   Presidential executive powers  Within the executive branch itself, the president has broad powers to manage national affairs and the workings of the federal government. The president can issue rules, regulations, and instructions called  executive orders , which have the binding force of law upon federal agencies but do not require congressional approval. As commander-in-chief of the  armed forces of the United States , the president may also call into federal service the state units of the  National Guard . In times of war or national emergency, the  Congress  may grant the president even broader powers to manage the national economy and protect the security of the United States.     Abraham Lincoln 16th President (1861-1865)  The president nominates — and the  Senate  confirms — the heads of all executive departments and agencies, together with hundreds of other high-ranking federal officials. (See  United States Cabinet ,  Executive Office of the President .)  In  2003 , more than 3000 executive agency positions were subject to presidential appointment, with more than 1200 requiring Senate approval. The large majority of federal workers, however, are selected through the  Civil Service  system, in which appointment and promotion are based on ability and experience.  The President is also responsible for preparing the budget of the United States, although the Congress must approve it.  (See  Office of Management and Budget )   Presidential legislative powers  Despite the constitutional provision that ""all legislative powers"" shall be vested in the  Congress , the president, as the chief formulator of public policy, has a major legislative role. The president can veto any bill passed by Congress and, unless two-thirds of the members of each house vote to override the veto, the bill does not become law.  Much of the legislation dealt with by Congress is drafted at the initiative of the executive branch. In annual and special messages to Congress, the president may propose legislation he believes is necessary. The most important of these is the annual  State of the Union Address  traditionally given in January. Before a joint session of Congress, the President outlines the status of the country and his legislative proposals for the upcoming year. If Congress should adjourn without acting on those proposals, the president has the power to call it into special session. But beyond this official role, the president, as head of a political party and as principal executive officer of the U.S. government, is primarily in a position to influence public opinion and thereby to influence the course of legislation in Congress.   Theodore Roosevelt 26th President (1901-1909)  To improve their working relationships with Congress, presidents in recent years have set up a Congressional Liaison Office in the  White House . Presidential aides keep abreast of all important legislative activities and try to persuade senators and representatives of both parties to support administration policies.   Presidential judicial powers  Among the president's constitutional powers is that of appointing important public officials. Presidential nomination of federal judges, including members of the  Supreme Court , is subject to confirmation by the Senate. Another significant power is that of granting a full or conditional pardon to anyone convicted of breaking a federal law — except in a case of impeachment. The pardoning power has come to embrace the power to shorten prison terms and reduce fines.   Presidential powers in foreign affairs  Under the Constitution, the president is the federal official primarily responsible for the relations of the United States with foreign nations. The president appoints ambassadors, ministers, and consuls — subject to confirmation by the Senate — and receives foreign ambassadors and other public officials. With the secretary of state, the president manages all official contacts with foreign governments. On occasion, the president may personally participate in summit conferences where chiefs of state meet for direct consultation. Thus, President  Woodrow Wilson  headed the American delegation to the  Paris  conference at the end of World War I; President  Franklin D. Roosevelt  met with  Allied  leaders during  World War II ; and every president since then has sat down with world leaders to discuss economic and political issues and to reach bilateral and multilateral agreements.   Franklin D. Roosevelt   32nd President (1933-1945)  Through the  Department of State , the president is responsible for the protection of Americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the United States. The president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments, and negotiate treaties with other nations, which become binding on the United States when approved by two-thirds of the Senate. The president may also negotiate ""executive agreements"" with foreign powers that are not subject to Senate confirmation.   Constraints on Presidential power  Because of the vast array of presidential roles and responsibilities, coupled with a conspicuous presence on the national and international scene, political analysts have tended to place great emphasis on the president's powers. Some have even spoken of ""the  imperial presidency ,"" referring to the expanded role of the office that Franklin D. Roosevelt maintained during his term.  One of the first sobering realities a new president discovers is an inherited bureaucratic structure that can be difficult to manage and slow to change direction. The president's power to appoint extends only to some 3,000 people out of a civilian government work force of about 3 million.     John F. Kennedy 35th President (1961-1963)  The president finds that the machinery of government (the  civil service ) often operates independently of presidential interventions, has done so through earlier administrations, and will continue to do so in the future. New presidents are immediately confronted with a backlog of decisions from the outgoing administration. They inherit a budget formulated and enacted into law long before they came to office, as well as major spending programs (such as veterans' benefits,  Social Security  payments, and  Medicare  health insurance for the elderly), which are mandated by law. In foreign affairs, presidents must conform with treaties and informal agreements negotiated by their predecessors in office.  As the happy euphoria of the post-election ""honeymoon"" dissipates, the new president discovers that Congress has become less cooperative and the media more critical. The president is forced to build at least temporary alliances among diverse, often antagonistic interests — economic, geographic, ethnic, and ideological. Compromises with Congress must be struck if any legislation is to be adopted. ""It is very easy to defeat a bill in Congress,"" lamented President  John F. Kennedy . ""It is much more difficult to pass one.""  Despite these constraints, every president achieves at least some of his legislative goals and prevents by veto the enactment of other laws he believes not to be in the nation's best interests. The president's authority in the conduct of war and peace, including the negotiation of treaties, is substantial. Moreover, the president can use his unique position to articulate ideas and advocate policies, which then have a better chance of entering the public consciousness than those held by his political rivals. President  Theodore Roosevelt  called this aspect of the presidency ""the bully pulpit,"" for when a president raises an issue, it inevitably becomes subject to public debate. A president's power and influence may be limited, but they are also greater than those of any other American, in or out of office.  Though constrained by various other laws passed by Congress, the President's executive branch conducts most foreign policy, and his power to order and direct troops as commander-in-chief is quite significant. (The exact limits of what a President can do with the military without Congressional authorization are open to debate.)   Requirements to hold office   Article 2 , Section 1, of the  U.S. Constitution  sets the requirements one must meet in order to become President:   A natural-born citizen of the United States   Thirty-five years of age   Resident of the United States for 14 years.   Succession  There is a well-defined sequence of who should fill the Presidential office, upon the death, resignation, or removal from office (by  impeachment  and subsequent conviction) of a sitting President:    the  Vice President of the United States    the  Speaker of the House of Representatives    the  President pro tempore of the United States Senate .   This list is only partial.  See the entire  United States Presidential line of succession . The  Twenty-fifth Amendment  was ratified to define how the President is deemed incapable of discharging his powers and duties and when the Vice President becomes  Acting President .

Franklin Pierce was the first president born in the  19th Century .  Warren Harding was the first president born after the  American Civil War   John F. Kennedy was the first president born in the  20th Century .  Jimmy Carter was the first president born after the  First World War   Bill Clinton was the first president born after the  Second World War   Former Presidents  After a President leaves office, he continues to be referred to as ""President"" for the rest of his life. Former Presidents continue to be important national figures, and in some cases go on to successful post-presidential careers. Notable examples have included former President  William Howard Taft 's appointment as  Chief Justice of the United States  and former President  Jimmy Carter 's current career as a global  human rights  campaigner.   Currently, there are five living former presidents.  They are:  Former President  Gerald Ford   Former President  Jimmy Carter   Former President  Ronald Reagan   Former President  George H. W. Bush   Former President  Bill Clinton   There have been only two other occasions where five former presidents were alive:   From  March 4 ,  1861  to  January 18 ,  1862  Presidents  Martin Van Buren ,  John Tyler ,  Millard Fillmore ,  Franklin Pierce , and  James Buchanan  were living.   From  January 20 ,  1993  to  April 22 ,  1994  Presidents  Richard Nixon ,  Gerald Ford ,  Jimmy Carter ,  Ronald Reagan , and  George H. W. Bush  were living.   Presidential salary and perks       Presidential Pay History   Date established Salary   September 24, 1789 $25,000   March 3, 1873 $50,000   March 4, 1909 $75,000   January 19, 1949 $100,000   January 20, 1969 $200,000   January 20, 2001 $400,000      The first  United States Congress  voted to pay  George Washington  a salary of $25,000 a year, a significant sum in  1789 . Washington, already a successful man, didn't take the money.  Since  2001 , the President has earned a salary of $400,000 a year, modest in comparison to the multi-million dollar salaries of most private-sector chief executive officers.  Traditionally, the President, as the most important official in the  U.S. government , is to be the highest paid government employee.  Consequently, the President's salary serves as a cap of sorts for all other federal officials such as the  Chief Justice . The raise for 2001 was approved by Congress and President  Bill Clinton  in  1999  because other officials who receive annual cost-of-living increases had salaries approaching the President's.  Thus, in order to raise the salaries of other federal employees, the President's salary had to be raised to avoid surpassing the President.  Modern Presidents enjoy many non-salary perks such as living and working in the spacious  White House  mansion in  Washington, DC .  While travelling, the President is able to conduct all the functions of the office aboard several specially-built Boeing 747s, which take the call-sign  Air Force One  when the President is aboard.  The President travels around Washington in an armored  Cadillac  limousine, equipped with bullet-proof windows and tires and a self-contained ventilation system in the event of a biological attack.  When traveling longer distances around the Washington area, the President travels aboard the Presidential helicopter, Marine One.  Additionally, the President has full use of  Camp David  in  Maryland , a sprawling retreat occasionally used as a casual setting for hosting foreign dignitaries.  At all times, the President and his family are protected by an extensive  Secret Service  detail.  Until the law was changed in 1997, all former Presidents and their family were protected by the Secret Service until their death. The last President to have Secret Service protection for life is Bill Clinton. George Walker Bush and all following Presidents will be protected by the Secret Service for a maximum of 10 years after leaving office.    Presidential facts  Four U.S. Presidents have been assassinated while in office:    Abraham Lincoln  in  1865  by  John Wilkes Booth     James Garfield  in  1881  by  Charles J. Guiteau  (Guiteau shot him but Garfield arguably died due to subsequent incorrect medical care)    William McKinley  in  1901  by  Leon Czolgosz     John F. Kennedy  in  1963  by  Lee Harvey Oswald   [1]   although many theories posit additional gunmen.

These men held very few powers that are now associated with the U.S. presidency and cannot be considered to have been heads of state. Their primary duty was to  preside  over the Congress (hence the original meaning of ""president"").   Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled   Main article :  President of the United States in Congress Assembled  There were ten Presidents under the  Articles of Confederation . These men held few powers that are now associated with the U.S. presidency and cannot be considered to have been heads of state or the ""Chief Executive"".
