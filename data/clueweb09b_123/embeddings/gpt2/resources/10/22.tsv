ABOUT THIS FAQ      Last modified 26 May 2008        This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been compiled from questions asked of the SPC as well as basic tornado research information and countless scientific resources.  More material will be added, time permitting.  If you find a link not working or an error of any sort, please  e-mail the FAQ author .     The  Tornado FAQ is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to tornadoes. Instead, it is a quick-reference summary of tornado knowledge, which will link you to more detailed information if you desire. Recent books from your local library or a major university library are still the deepest resource for learning about tornadoes and other  severe storms; so if you are doing your own research or school reports, please visit the library in person. There are many good websites with tornado information also. Some of them are linked from the answers below. None of the links to outside websites implies any kind of commercial endorsement on the part of the SPC. The intent here is to direct you to the best tornado info available. There is also a partial  list of technical scientific references  related to tornadoes for  those with some meteorological education and training.

Complete Tornado FAQ content is found at the  mirror-backup site .        THE BASICS ABOUT TORNADOES      What is a tornado?     According  to the  Glossary of Meteorology  (AMS 2000), a tornado is  ""a violently rotating column of air, pendant  from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.""   Literally, in order for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground  and  the cloud base.  Weather scientists haven't found it so simple in practice, however, to classify and define tornadoes.  For example, the difference is unclear between an strong mesocyclone (parent thunderstorm circulation) on the ground, and a large, weak tornado.  There is also disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. It is well-known that a tornado may  not have a visible funnel . Also, at what wind speed of the cloud-to-ground vortex does a tornado begin?   How close must two or more different tornadic circulations become to qualify as a one  multiple-vortex tornado , instead of separate tornadoes?  There are no firm answers.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes form?    The classic answer -- ""warm moist Gulf air meets cold Canadian air and dry air from the Rockies"" -- is a gross oversimplification.  Many thunderstorms  form under those conditions (near warm fronts, cold fronts and drylines respectively), which never even come close  to producing tornadoes.   Even  when the large-scale environment is extremely favorable for tornadic thunderstorms, as in an SPC ""High Risk"" outlook, not every thunderstorm spawns a tornado.  The truth is that we don't fully understand.   The   most  destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from  supercells  -- which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a    mesocyclone .   [Supercells   can  also produce  damaging hail , severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent  lightning , and  flash floods .] Tornado formation is believed to be dictated mainly by things which happen  on the storm scale , in and around the mesocyclone.   Recent theories and results from the  VORTEX  program suggest that once a mesocyclone is underway, tornado  development is related to the temperature differences across the edge of downdraft air wrapping around the mesocyclone (the   occlusion downdraft ).  Mathematical modeling studies of tornado formation also indicate that it can happen without such temperature patterns; and in fact, very little temperature variation was observed near some of the most destructive tornadoes in history on  3 May 1999 .  The details behind these theories are given in several of the  Scientific References  accompanying this FAQ.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What direction  do tornadoes come from?  Does the region of the US play a role in path direction?       Tornadoes can appear from any direction.  Most move from southwest to northeast, or west to east.  Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked.  [A tornado can double back suddenly, for example, when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core.]  Some areas of the US  tend  to have more paths from a specific direction, such as northwest in Minnesota or southeast in coastal south Texas.  This is because of an increased frequency of certain tornado-producing weather patterns (say, hurricanes in south Texas, or northwest-flow weather systems in the upper Midwest).    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Does  hail always come before the tornado?  Rain?   Lightning ?  Utter silence?    Not necessarily, for any of those.  Rain, wind,  lightning ,  and  hail  characteristics vary from storm to storm, from one hour to the next, and even with the direction the storm is moving with respect to the observer.  While large hail  can  indicate the presence of an unusually dangerous thunderstorm, and  can  happen before a tornado, don't depend on it.  Hail, or any particular pattern of rain, lightning or calmness, is not a reliable predictor of tornado threat.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes dissipate?    The details are still debated by tornado scientists.  We do know tornadoes need a source of instability (heat, moisture, etc.) and a larger-scale property of rotation ( vorticity ) to keep going.  There are a lot of processes around a thunderstorm which can possibly rob the area around a tornado of either instability or vorticity.  One is relatively cold  outflow  -- the flow of wind out of the precipitation area of a shower or thunderstorm.  Many tornadoes have been observed to go away soon after being hit by outflow.  For decades, storm observers have documented the death of numerous tornadoes when their parent circulations ( mesocyclones ) weaken after they become wrapped in outflow air -- either from the same thunderstorm or a different one.  The irony is that some kinds of thunderstorm outflow may help to  cause  tornadoes, while other forms of outflow may  kill  tornadoes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do tornadoes really skip?     Not in a literal sense, despite what you may have read in many older references, news stories, or even damage survey reports.  By definition (above), a tornado must be in  contact with the ground.  There is disagreement in meteorology over whether or not multiple touchdowns of the same vortex or  funnel cloud  mean different tornadoes (a strict interpretation).  In either event, stories of skipping tornadoes usually mean    There was continuous contact between vortex and ground in the path, but it was too weak to do damage;   Multiple tornadoes happened; but there was no survey done to precisely separate their paths (very common before the 1970s); or  There were multiple tornadoes with only short separation, but the survey erroneously classified them as one tornado.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      How long does a tornado last?    Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour.  The longest-lived tornado in history is really unknown, because so many of the long-lived tornadoes reported from the early-mid 1900s and before are believed to be tornado series instead.  Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How close to a tornado does the barometer drop?  And how far does it drop ?     It varies. A barometer can start dropping many hours or even days in advance of a tornado if there is low pressure on a broad scale moving into the area. Strong pressure falls will often happen as the mesocyclone (parent circulation in the thunderstorm) moves overhead or nearby. The biggest drop will be in the tornado itself, of course. It is very hard to measure pressure in tornadoes since most weather instruments can't survive. A few low-lying, armored probes called "" turtles "" have been placed successfully in tornadoes. This includes one deployment on 15 May 2003 by engineer/storm chaser Tim Samaras, who recorded pressure fall of over 40 millibars through an unusually large tornado. On 24 June 2003, another of Tim's probes recorded a  100 millibar  pressure plunge in a violent tornado near Manchester, SD ( National Geographic report ). Despite those spectacular results, and a few fortuitous passes over barometers through history, we still do not have a database of tornado pressures big enough to say much about average tornado pressures or other barometric characteristics.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a waterspout?    A waterspout is a  tornado over water  -- usually meaning non-supercell tornadoes over water.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast -- especially off southern Florida and the Keys -- and can happen over seas, bays and lakes worldwide.  Although waterspouts are always tornadoes by definition; they don't officially count in tornado records unless they hit land.  They are smaller and weaker than the most intense Great Plains tornadoes, but still can be quite dangerous.  Waterspouts can overturn small boats, damage ships, do significant damage when hitting land, and kill people.  The  National Weather Service  will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts can move onshore.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How are tornadoes in the northern hemisphere different from tornadoes in the southern hemisphere?    The sense of rotation is usually the opposite. Most tornadoes -- but not all! -- rotate  cyclonically , which is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise south of the equator.  Anticyclonic tornadoes  (clockwise-spinning in the northern hemisphere) have been observed, however -- usually in the form of waterspouts, non-supercell land tornadoes, or anticyclonic whirls around the rim of a supercell's mesocyclone. There have been several documented cases of cyclonic and anticyclonic tornadoes under the same thunderstorm at the same time. Anticyclonically rotating supercells with tornadoes are extremely rare; but  one struck near Sunnyvale, CA , in 1998. Remember, ""cyclonic"" tornadoes spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is a multivortex  tornado ?   Multivortex (a.k.a. multiple-vortex) tornadoes contain two or more small, intense  subvortices  orbiting the center of the larger tornado circulation.  When a tornado doesn't contain too much dust and debris,  they can sometimes be spectacularly  visible .  These vortices may form and die within a few seconds, sometimes appearing to train through the same part of the tornado one after another.  They can happen in all sorts of tornado sizes, from huge "" wedge "" tornadoes to narrow "" rope "" tornadoes. Subvortices are the cause of most of the narrow, short, extreme swaths of damage that sometimes arc through tornado tracks.  From the air, they can preferentially mow down crops and stack the stubble, leaving  cycloidal marks in fields .  Multivortex tornadoes are the source of most of the old stories from newspapers and other media before the late  20th century which told of several tornadoes seen together at once.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the original F-scale?    Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed a damage scale (Fujita 1971, Fujita and Pearson 1973) for winds, including tornadoes, which was supposed to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of the wind.   This scale was the result.  The original F-scale should not be used anymore, because it has been replaced by  an enhanced version .  Tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown; and  the wind speeds on the original F-scale have never been scientifically tested and proven . Different winds may be needed to cause the same damage depending on how well-built a structure is, wind direction, wind duration,  battering by flying debris, and a bunch of other factors.  Also, the process of rating the damage itself is largely a judgment call -- quite inconsistent and arbitrary (Doswell and Burgess, 1988).  Even  meteorologists and engineers highly experienced in damage survey techniques often came up with different F-scale ratings for the same damage.  Even with all its flaws, the original F-scale was the only widely used tornado rating method for over three decades.  The  enhanced F-scale  takes effect 1 February 2007.   BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the Enhanced F-scale?     The Enhanced F-scale  ( simple table  or detailed  95 page PDF ) is a much more precise and robust way to assess tornado damage than the  original .  It classifies F0-F5 damage as calibrated by engineers and meteorologists across 28 different types of damage indicators (mainly various kinds of buildings, but also a few other structures as well as trees).  The idea is that a ""one size fits all"" approach just doesn't work in rating tornado damage, and that a tornado scale needs to take into account the typical strengths and weaknesses of different types of construction.  This is because the same wind does different things to different kinds of structures.  In the Enhanced F-scale, there will be different, customized standards for assigning any given F rating to a well built, well anchored wood-frame house compared to a garage, school, skyscraper, unanchored house, barn, factory, utility pole or other type of structure.  In a real-life tornado track, these ratings can be mapped together more smoothly to make a damage analysis.  Of course, there still will be gaps and weaknesses on a track where there was little or nothing to damage, but such problems will be less common than under the  original F-scale .  As with the original F-scale, the enhanced version will rate the tornado as a whole based on most intense damage within the path.    There are no plans to systematically re-evaluate historical tornadoes using the Enhanced F-scale.   A full PDF document on the Enhanced F-scale is online .  BACK UP TO THE TOP        So if the original F-scale winds are just guesses, why are they so specific?    Excellent question.  Those winds were arbitrarily attached to the damage scale based on 12-step mathematical interpolation between the hurricane criteria of the  Beaufort wind scale , and the threshold for Mach 1 (738 mph).  Though the F-scale actually peaks at F12 (Mach 1), only F1 through F5 are used in practice, with F0 attached for tornadoes of winds weaker than hurricane force.  Again, F-scale wind-to-damage relationships are untested, unknown and purely hypothetical.  They have never been proven and may not represent real tornadoes.  F-scale winds should not be taken literally.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      I heard the Oklahoma City tornado was almost ""F6.""  Is that a real  level on the original F-scale?    Only in untested theory.  Fujita plotted hypothetical winds higher than F5; but as mentioned in the previous answer above, they were only guesses.  Even if the winds measured by portable Doppler radar (32 meters above ground level, roughly 302 mph)  had been over 318 mph, the tornado would still be rated ""only"" F5 since F5 is the  most intense possible damage level .  On the  Enhanced F-scale , there is no such thing as ""F6.""    BACK UP TO THE TOP        What is a ""significant"" tornado?    A tornado is classified as ""significant"" if it does F2 or greater damage on the  Enhanced F scale . Grazulis (1993) also included killer tornadoes of any damage scale in his significant tornado database.   It is important to know that those definitions are arbitrary, for scientific research.  No tornado is  necessarily  in significant.  Any tornado can kill or cause damage; and some tornadoes rated less than F2  probably could do F2 or greater damage if they hit a well-built house during peak intensity.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       Big  fat tornadoes are the strongest ones, right?     Not necessarily. There is a statistical trend (as  documented  by NSSL's Harold Brooks) toward wide tornadoes having higher  F-scale  damage.  This can be out of more strength or out of greater opportunity for targets to damage -- or some blend of both.  However, the size or shape of  any particular tornado  does not say anything conclusive about its strength.  Some small "" rope ""  tornadoes can still do violent damage of  F4 or F5 ; and some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have  produced only weak damage of  F0 to F1 .    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Can't  we weaken or destroy tornadoes somehow, like by bombing them or sucking out their heat with a bunch of dry ice?    The main problem with anything which could  realistically stand a chance at affecting a tornado (e.g., hydrogen bomb) is that it would be even more deadly and  destructive than the tornado itself.  Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)  would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the  tornado much anyway.  Imagine the legal problems one would face, too, by trying to bomb or ice a tornado, then  inadvertently hurting someone or destroying private property in the process.  In short -- bad idea!  BACK UP TO THE TOP       How does cloud seeding affect tornadoes?    Nobody knows, for certain. There is no proof that seeding can or cannot change tornado potential in a thunderstorm.   This is because there is no way to know that the things a thunderstorm does after seeding would not have happened  anyway . This includes any presence or lack of rain, hail, wind gusts or tornadoes. Because the effects of seeding are impossible to prove  or disprove, there is a great deal of controversy in meteorology about whether it works, and if so, under what conditions, and  to what extent.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What does a tornado sound like?     That depends on what it is hitting, its size, intensity, closeness and other factors.  The most common tornado sound is a  continuous rumble, like a closeby train.  Sometimes a tornado produces a loud whooshing sound, like that of a waterfall or of open car windows while driving very fast.  Tornadoes which are tearing through densely populated areas may be producing all kinds of  loud noises at once, which collectively may make a tremendous roar.   Just because you may have heard a loud roar during a damaging storm does not necessarily mean it was a tornado .  Any intense thunderstorm wind can produce damage and cause a roar.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get tornado pictures?     Photographic   prints of tornadoes are sold by a number of storm chasers  and by the  NSEA Concession . You can see many interesting free weather images at  http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/noaa_products/ . There are also several stock photography agencies specializing in, or peddling on the side, weather photos which include tornadoes. A search engine can help you find online stock photo outfits and tornado photographs. For digital online photos, many tornado-related websites display images; but since all personal photography is legally copyrighted upon creation. Photos on this site and all National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) agencies, including the National Weather Service, are public domain and free to download, though credit to the agency and/or source is required.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get video of tornadoes?    Public-domain videos of National Severe Storms Lab tornado intercept footage are available for a reproduction fee through a  video transfer service  used by NSSL.  Many production companies, TV stations and storm chasers have made videotapes of tornadoes available for sale as well.  Try web search engines and storm chaser pages.  This FAQ will not endorse any particular commercial tornado video source or tour operation.   BACK UP TO THE TOP         Do hurricanes and tropical storms produce tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  There are great differences from storm to storm, not  necessarily  related to tropical cyclone size or intensity.  Some landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. fail to produce any known tornadoes, while others cause major outbreaks.  The same hurricane also may have none for awhile, then erupt with tornadoes...or vice versa!  Andrew (1992), for example, spawned several tornadoes across the Deep South after crossing the Gulf, but produced none during its rampage across South Florida.  Katrina (2005) spawned numerous tornadoes after its devastating LA/MS landfall, but only one in Florida (in the Keys).  Though fewer tornadoes tend to occur with tropical depressions and tropical storms than hurricanes, there are notable exceptions like TS Beryl of 1994 in the Carolinas.  Some tropical cyclones even produce two distinct sets of tornadoes -- one around the time of landfall over Florida or the Gulf Coast,  the other when well inland or exiting the Atlantic coast.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What's the nature of tornadoes in hurricanes and tropical storms?        Hurricane-spawned tornadoes  tend to occur in small, low-topped supercells  within the outer bands, NNW through ESE of the center -- mainly the northeast quadrant.  There, the orientation and speed of the winds create  vertical shear profiles somewhat resembling those around  classic Great Plains supercells  -- the shear being in a shallower layer but often stronger.  Occasionally a tornado will happen in the inner bands as well, but the large majority still form  outside  the hurricane force wind zone.  Because tornado-producing circulations in hurricane supercells tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their Midwest counterparts,  they are harder to detect on  Doppler radar , and more difficult to warn for.  But hurricane-spawned tornadoes can still be quite deadly and destructive,  as shown by the F3 tornado from Hurricane Andrew at La Place LA (1992, 2 killed) and an F4 tornado at Galveston TX from Hurricane Carla  (1961, 8 killed).    BACK UP TO THE TOP       Do tropical cyclones produce  waterspouts ?       Yes.  Waterspouts -- tornadoes over water -- have been observed in tropical systems.  We don't know how many of them happen in tropical cyclones, but a majority probably are from supercells.  The similarity in  Doppler radar  velocity signatures over water to tornado-producing cells in landfalling hurricanes suggests that it may be common -- and yet another good reason for ships to steer well clear of tropical cyclones.     BACK UP TO THE TOP       Does tropical cyclone strength or size matter for tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  Relatively weak hurricanes like Danny (1985) have spawned significant supercell tornadoes well inland, as have larger, more intense storms like Beulah (1967) and Ivan (2004).  In general, the bigger and stronger the wind fields are with a tropical cyclone, the bigger the area of favorable wind shear for supercells and tornadoes.  But supercell tornadoes (whether or not in tropical cyclones) also depend on instability, lift and moisture.  Surface moisture isn't lacking in a tropical cyclone, but sometimes instability and lift are too weak.  This is why tropical systems tend to produce more tornadoes in the daytime and near any fronts that may get involved in the cyclone circulation.  It is also why SPC won't  always  have tornado watches out for every instance of a tropical cyclone affecting land.  For more details, there is a set of articles on tropical cyclone tornadoes  listed in the  Scientific References  section.  For more information on hurricanes, go to the  Tropical Cyclone FAQ  by Chris Landsea, Neal Dorst and Erica Rule.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      TORNADO FORECASTING      Who forecasts tornadoes?       In the U.S., only the National Weather Service (NWS) issues tornado forecasts nationwide. Warnings come from   each NWS office . The   Storm Prediction Center  issues  watches , general  severe weather outlooks , and  mesoscale discussions . Tornadoes in Canada are handled by the   Meteorological Service of Canada . Very few other nations have specific tornado watch and warning services.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do you forecast tornadoes?      This is  a  very  simple question with no simple answer!  Here is a  very  generalized view from the perspective of a severe weather forecaster: When predicting severe weather (including tornadoes) a day or two in advance, we look for  the development of temperature and wind flow patterns in the atmosphere which can cause enough  moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear  for tornadic thunderstorms. Those are the four needed ingredients.  But it is not as easy as it sounds.  ""How much is enough"" of those is not a hard fast number, but varies a lot from situation to situation -- and sometimes is unknown!  A large variety of weather patterns can lead to tornadoes; and often, similar patterns may produce no severe weather at all.  To further complicate it, the various computer models we use days in advance can have major biases and flaws when the forecaster tries to interpret them on the scale of thunderstorms.  As the event gets closer, the forecast usually (but not always) loses some uncertainty and narrows down to a more precise threat area.  [At SPC, this is the   transition from outlook to mesoscale discussion to watch .]  Real-time weather observations -- from satellites, weather stations, balloon packages, airplanes, wind profilers and radar-derived winds -- become more and more critical the sooner the thunderstorms are expected; and the models become less important.  To figure out where the thunderstorms will form, we must do some hard, short-fuse detective work:  Find out the location, strength and movement of the fronts,  drylines, outflows, and other boundaries between air masses which tend to provide lift.  Figure out the moisture and temperatures -- both near ground and aloft -- which will help storms form and stay alive in this situation.  Find the wind structures in the atmosphere which can make a thunderstorm rotate as a  supercell , then produce  tornadoes .  [Many supercells never spawn a tornado!]  Make an educated guess where the most favorable combination of  ingredients will be and when; then draw the areas and type the forecast.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       That sounds really hard.   What  hardware and software tools do you use to help you forecast tornadoes?    The most important hardware for forecasting at the  Storm Prediction Center  is the human hand.  Numerous  hand-drawn analyses  of surface and upper-air data are still performed at SPC every day so forecasters can be intimately familiar with the weather features.  SPC forecasters also use high-performance computer workstations (mainly running Unix and Windows 98), with a huge variety of software to display the things we need to help us forecast severe weather.  The variety of those things is enormous:  many kinds of  computer model displays ,  satellite  image  loops,  radar displays ,  wind profiler  and  radar-wind plots ,  data from surface weather stations ,   upper air data from balloons  and planes,  lightning strike plots ,  weather data tables ,  multiple-source overlays , and more. It may sound trite; but by far, the most important software in the tornado forecast process is within the human brain.  The forecaster must use it to sort all that information, toss out what is not needed,  properly interpret what is needed, and put it into a coherent form -- all on a time deadline.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is needed to be a good tornado forecaster?    It all starts with...    Motivation:  Almost all severe storms forecasters are passionate about violent weather, with an intense desire to learn about and become better at predicting it.  For many, this dates back into childhood -- a first-hand encounter with violent storms, images on TV or in books and magazines, or even a deep attraction to storms which goes back too far to recall.  Others start out in other fields or college majors, then became fascinated with severe weather.  In any case, this desire leads to...  Education:  Consistently good severe storms forecasters have a solid educational background in atmospheric science which allows them to understand ""textbook"" concepts of thunderstorm formation.  They don't stop with their college education, either.  They constantly re-educate themselves in the latest discoveries about severe thunderstorms and tornadoes -- reading scientific journal articles on cutting-edge research, perhaps doing some research themselves.  The understanding of storms which results lets the forecaster think of ""conceptual models"" -- visualizations of what the storms will do and how.  Flexibility:  Because the atmosphere doesn't read textbooks or science journals, the forecaster must adapt those ""classroom"" ideas to  an endless variety of day-to-day situations which may look a lot different.  He or she also should be able to recognize when and why a forecast is not working out, and make the right adjustments.  These skills come from...  Experience:  In meteorology, history never repeats itself exactly.  But certain types of situations do recur, allowing the forecaster to set a mental  benchmark for what to expect.  From there, he or she can better decide what data will be most important to examine, and what data  will not be as relevant to the situation.  Experienced forecasters are able to learn how bad forecasts went wrong and how good forecasts worked each time, building a more complete mental warehouse of severe storm forecast knowledge as time passes.  When the experience is  continually blended with motivation, flexibility and more education, he or she will keep improving as a forecaster.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the tornado forecast for next spring?  Are there going to be tornadoes in Iowa the week of next October 5?     We  just don't know.  Tornado forecasting today and tomorrow is quite difficult already.  Specific severe weather forecasting more than days in advance is little more than guessing, or using tornado climatology for the forecast area and time of year.  For that  reason, there is no such thing as a long range severe storm or tornado forecast.  There are simply too  many small-scale variables involved which we cannot reliably measure or model weeks or months ahead of time; so no scientific forecasters even attempt them.  Our farthest convective  outlook is for day-3, and can be found on the  SPC Forecasts page . Perhaps, someday, the density of weather observations and atmospheric modeling capabilities will advance  enough to allow us to do severe storms forecasting many days out with some degree of accuracy better than a coin toss.  We are a long, long way from that kind of forecasting!  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is the role of Doppler radar in tornado forecasting?    Each NWS forecast office uses output from at least one  Doppler radar  in the area to help to determine if a  warning  is needed. Doppler radar signatures can tell warning meteorologists a great deal about a thunderstorm's structure, but usually can't see the tornado itself.  This is because the radar beam gets too wide to resolve even the biggest tornadoes within a few tens of miles after leaving the transmitter.  Instead, a radar indicates strong winds blowing toward and away from it in a way that tells forecasters, ""An intense circulation probably exists in this storm and a tornado is possible.""  Possible doesn't mean certain, though.  That is why local forecasters must also depend on spotter reports,  SPC forecast guidance  on the general severe weather threat, and in-house analysis of the weather situation over the region containing thunderstorms, to make the best-informed warning decisions.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      What was the first  successful tornado forecast?    Nobody knows when was the first time someone claimed a tornado would occur in an area, and it happened.  But the first documented, successful tornado forecast by meteorologists was on March 25, 1948, by  Air Force Capt. (later Col.) Robert Miller  and  Major Ernest Fawbush .  After they noticed striking similarities in the developing weather pattern to others which produced tornadoes  (including the Tinker AFB, OK, tornado several days before), Fawbush and Miller advised their superior officer of a tornado threat in central Oklahoma that evening.  Compelled from above to issue a yes/no decision on a tornado forecast after  thunderstorms developed in western Oklahoma, they put out the word of possible tornadoes, and the base carried out safety precautions. A few hours later, despite the tiny odds of a repeat, the second tornado in five days directly hit the base.  For more insight into this event, Charlie Crisp has transcribed the late Col. Miller's recollections of the event; and they   are now online .   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is the history of tornado forecasting?     It's too long and eventful to summarize here; but there is an  online guide  at NSSL, as well as a  timeline of SELS and SPC , and a  history of the SPC  that provide insight into how tornado prediction has evolved.  There is also an entire book devoted to the subject:   Scanning the Skies : A History of Tornado Forecasting  by Marlene Bradford (hardcover - March 2001).   Some libraries, bookstores and online book sellers carry this comprehensive and detailed history work.     BACK UP TO THE TOP      Was tornado forecasting once banned in the U.S.?      Yes.  Before 1950, at various stages of development of the Weather Bureau, the use of the word ""tornado"" in forecasts was at times strongly discouraged and at other times forbidden, because of a fear that predicting tornadoes may cause panic.  This was in an era when very little was known about tornadoes compared to today, by both scientists and the public at large.  Tornadoes were, for most, dark and mysterious menaces of unfathomable power, fast-striking monsters from the sky capable of sudden and unpredictable acts of death and devastation.  As the weather patterns which led to major tornado events became better documented and researched, the mystery behind predicting them began to clear -- a process which still is far from complete, of course.  In 1950, the Weather Bureau  revoked the ban  (PDF) on mentioning tornadoes in forecasts.  BACK UP TO THE TOP        How has SPC performed with tornado forecasting?     By  most measures, SPC (formerly SELS, NSSFC) has improved its tornado forecasting over the past few decades. There are many ways to objectively gauge forecast performance -- for example,  verifying tornado watches with tornado reports  and  both watch types by all severe reports . The general trend from 1985-2003 has been for a greater percentage of tornado watches to contain tornadoes.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO DAMAGE      How is tornado damage rated?    The most widely used method worldwide, for over three decades, was the  F-scale  developed by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita.  In the U.S., and probably elsewhere within a few years, the new  Enhanced F-scale  is becoming the standard for assessing tornado damage. In Britain,  there is a  scale  similar to the original F-scale but with more divisions; for more info, go to   the TORRO scale website .  In both original F- and TORRO-scales, the wind speeds are based on calculations of the   Beaufort wind scale  and have never been scientifically verified in real tornadoes.  Enhanced F-scale winds are derived from engineering guidelines but still are only judgmental estimates.  Because:   Nobody knows the ""true"" wind speeds at ground level in most tornadoes, and   The amount of wind needed to do similar-looking damage can vary greatly, even from block to block or building to building,    ...damage rating is (at best) an exercise in educated guessing.  Even experienced damage-survey meteorologists and wind engineers  can and often do disagree among themselves on a tornado's strength.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Who  surveys tornado damage?  What's the criteria for the National Weather Service to do a survey?    This varies from place to place; and there is no rigid criteria. The responsibility for damage survey decisions at  each NWS office  usually falls on the Warning-Coordination Meteorologist (WCM) and/or the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC). Budget constraints keep every tornado path from having a direct ground survey by NWS personnel; so  spotter, chaser  and news accounts may be used to rate relatively weak, remote or brief tornadoes. Killer tornadoes, those striking densely populated areas, or those generating reports of exceptional damage are given highest priority for ground surveys.  Most ground surveys involve the WCM and/or forecasters not having shift responsibility the day of the survey.  For outbreaks and unusually destructive events -- usually only a few times a year -- the NWS may support involvement by highly experienced damage survey experts and wind engineers from elsewhere in the country.  Aerial  surveys are expensive and usually reserved for tornado events with multiple casualties and/or massive degrees of damage. Sometimes, local NWS offices may have a cooperative agreement with local media or police to use their helicopters during surveys.   BACK UP TO THE TOP        How can a tornado destroy one house and leave the next one almost unscratched?    Most of the time, this happens either with  multiple-vortex  tornadoes or very small, intense single-vortex tornadoes.  The winds in most of a  multivortex tornado  may only be strong enough to do minor damage to a particular house.  But one of the smaller embedded subvortices, perhaps only a few dozen feet across, may strike the house next door with winds over 200 mph, causing complete destruction. Also, there can be great differences in construction from one building to the next, so that even in the same wind speed, one may be flattened while the other is barely nicked.  For example, a flimsy, unanchored mobile home may be  obliterated while all surrounding objects suffer little or no damage .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do tornadoes  do some weird things, like drive straw into trees,  strip road pavement and drive splinters into bricks?    The list of bizarre things attributed to tornadoes is almost endless. Much of it is folklore; but there are some weird scenes in tornado damage. Asphalt pavement may strip when tornado winds sandblast the edges with gravel and other small detritus, eroding the edges and causing chunks to peel loose from the road base. Storm chasers and damage surveyors have observed this phenomenon often after the passage of a violent tornado. With a specially designed cannon,   wind engineers at Texas Tech University  have fired boards and other objects at over 100 mph into various types of construction materials, duplicating some of the kinds of ""bizarre"" effects, such as wood splinters embedded in bricks. Intense winds can bend a tree or other objects, creating cracks in which debris (e.g., hay straw) becomes lodged before the tree straightens and the crack tightens shut again. All bizarre damage effects have a physical cause inside the roiling maelstrom of tornado winds. We don't fully understand what some of those causes are yet, however; because much of it is almost impossible to simulate in a lab.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      I've heard about  tornadoes picking up objects and carrying them for miles.  Does this happen? Who does research on it?    Yes, numerous tornadoes have lofted (mainly light) debris many miles into the sky, which was then carried by middle- and upper-atmospheric winds for long distances. The vertical winds in tornadoes can be strong enough to temporarily levitate even heavy objects if they have a large face to the wind or flat sides (like roofs, walls, trees and cars),  and are strong enough to carry lightweight objects tens of thousands of feet high.  Though the heaviest objects, such as railroad cars, can only be airborne for short distances, stories of checks and other papers found over 100 miles  away are often true. The Worcester MA tornado of 9 June 1953 carried mattress pieces high into the thunderstorm, where they were coated in ice, before they fell into Boston Harbor. Pilots reported seeing debris fluttering through the air at high altitude near the thunderstorm which spawned the Ruskin Heights MO tornado of 20 May 1957. There is a   research group at the University of Oklahoma  which studies tornado debris flight. If you personally know of a case of tornado debris carried long-distance, they have a hotline you can call to report it.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes?     The differences are in scale.  Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas.  Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes.  Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to damage property.  The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind.  Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.      Where can I find free pictures of tornado damage?        We have some public domain images of typical examples of F0 through F5 tornado damage linked from this FAQ's  F-scale page .   Otherwise, public-domain tornado damage pictures are scattered among various National Weather Service websites.   Because web addresses change so often, we don't maintain a listing of them here; but you can start your search at  this map of all NWS websites . Browse around for damage survey photos in severe weather and tornado event sections of  local NWS office pages ; and  please make sure the photos are not copyrighted before using them . If there are any doubts, or to get permission to use copyrighted  material, e-mail the webmaster at that office.  SPC  has some public-domain images and descriptions of Spencer, SD tornado damage available  here . If you want hardcopies for research projects, the best bet is to download and print public-domain images from a high-quality color printer. Even when using public-domain images, you should give proper credit to the source. Historical archives at local and college libraries might have public-domain hardcopy prints of historical tornado damage in your area.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO SAFETY      What should I do in case of a tornado?    That depends on where you are.   This list of tornado safety tips  covers most situations.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado watch?      A  tornado  watch defines an area shaped like a parallelogram, where tornadoes and other kinds of severe  weather are possible in the next several hours.  It does not mean tornadoes are imminent -- just that you need  to be alert, and to be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes do happen or a warning is issued.  This is the time to turn on local TV or radio, turn on and set the alarm switch on your weather radio, make sure you have ready access to safe shelter, and make your friends and family aware of the potential for tornadoes in the area.  The  Storm Prediction Center  issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches;  here is an example .  For more information on tornado watches and other SPC bulletins,  go here .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado warning?    A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted, or that  Doppler radar  indicates a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado. When a tornado warning is issued for your town or county, take immediate   safety  precautions.  local NWS offices  issue tornado warnings.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do  mobile homes attract tornadoes?    Of course not.  It may seem that way, considering most tornado deaths occur in them, and that some of the most graphic reports of tornado damage come from mobile home communities.  The reason for this is that mobile homes are, in general, much easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office buildings.  A brief, relatively weak tornado which may have gone undetected in the wilderness -- or  misclassified as severe straight-line thunderstorm winds while doing minor damage to sturdy houses -- can  blow a mobile home apart .  Historically, mobile home parks have been reliable  indicators , not attractors, of tornadoes.  BACK UP TO THE TOP   "

ABOUT THIS FAQ      Last modified 26 May 2008        This list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) has been compiled from questions asked of the SPC as well as basic tornado research information and countless scientific resources.  More material will be added, time permitting.  If you find a link not working or an error of any sort, please  e-mail the FAQ author .     The  Tornado FAQ is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to tornadoes. Instead, it is a quick-reference summary of tornado knowledge, which will link you to more detailed information if you desire. Recent books from your local library or a major university library are still the deepest resource for learning about tornadoes and other  severe storms; so if you are doing your own research or school reports, please visit the library in person. There are many good websites with tornado information also. Some of them are linked from the answers below. None of the links to outside websites implies any kind of commercial endorsement on the part of the SPC. The intent here is to direct you to the best tornado info available. There is also a partial  list of technical scientific references  related to tornadoes for  those with some meteorological education and training.

Complete Tornado FAQ content is found at the  mirror-backup site .        THE BASICS ABOUT TORNADOES      What is a tornado?     According  to the  Glossary of Meteorology  (AMS 2000), a tornado is  ""a violently rotating column of air, pendant  from a cumuliform cloud or underneath a cumuliform cloud, and often (but not always) visible as a funnel cloud.""   Literally, in order for a vortex to be classified as a tornado, it must be in contact with the ground  and  the cloud base.  Weather scientists haven't found it so simple in practice, however, to classify and define tornadoes.  For example, the difference is unclear between an strong mesocyclone (parent thunderstorm circulation) on the ground, and a large, weak tornado.  There is also disagreement as to whether separate touchdowns of the same funnel constitute separate tornadoes. It is well-known that a tornado may  not have a visible funnel . Also, at what wind speed of the cloud-to-ground vortex does a tornado begin?   How close must two or more different tornadic circulations become to qualify as a one  multiple-vortex tornado , instead of separate tornadoes?  There are no firm answers.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes form?    The classic answer -- ""warm moist Gulf air meets cold Canadian air and dry air from the Rockies"" -- is a gross oversimplification.  Many thunderstorms  form under those conditions (near warm fronts, cold fronts and drylines respectively), which never even come close  to producing tornadoes.   Even  when the large-scale environment is extremely favorable for tornadic thunderstorms, as in an SPC ""High Risk"" outlook, not every thunderstorm spawns a tornado.  The truth is that we don't fully understand.   The   most  destructive and deadly tornadoes occur from  supercells  -- which are rotating thunderstorms with a well-defined radar circulation called a    mesocyclone .   [Supercells   can  also produce  damaging hail , severe non-tornadic winds, unusually frequent  lightning , and  flash floods .] Tornado formation is believed to be dictated mainly by things which happen  on the storm scale , in and around the mesocyclone.   Recent theories and results from the  VORTEX  program suggest that once a mesocyclone is underway, tornado  development is related to the temperature differences across the edge of downdraft air wrapping around the mesocyclone (the   occlusion downdraft ).  Mathematical modeling studies of tornado formation also indicate that it can happen without such temperature patterns; and in fact, very little temperature variation was observed near some of the most destructive tornadoes in history on  3 May 1999 .  The details behind these theories are given in several of the  Scientific References  accompanying this FAQ.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What direction  do tornadoes come from?  Does the region of the US play a role in path direction?       Tornadoes can appear from any direction.  Most move from southwest to northeast, or west to east.  Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked.  [A tornado can double back suddenly, for example, when its bottom is hit by outflow winds from a thunderstorm's core.]  Some areas of the US  tend  to have more paths from a specific direction, such as northwest in Minnesota or southeast in coastal south Texas.  This is because of an increased frequency of certain tornado-producing weather patterns (say, hurricanes in south Texas, or northwest-flow weather systems in the upper Midwest).    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Does  hail always come before the tornado?  Rain?   Lightning ?  Utter silence?    Not necessarily, for any of those.  Rain, wind,  lightning ,  and  hail  characteristics vary from storm to storm, from one hour to the next, and even with the direction the storm is moving with respect to the observer.  While large hail  can  indicate the presence of an unusually dangerous thunderstorm, and  can  happen before a tornado, don't depend on it.  Hail, or any particular pattern of rain, lightning or calmness, is not a reliable predictor of tornado threat.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How  do tornadoes dissipate?    The details are still debated by tornado scientists.  We do know tornadoes need a source of instability (heat, moisture, etc.) and a larger-scale property of rotation ( vorticity ) to keep going.  There are a lot of processes around a thunderstorm which can possibly rob the area around a tornado of either instability or vorticity.  One is relatively cold  outflow  -- the flow of wind out of the precipitation area of a shower or thunderstorm.  Many tornadoes have been observed to go away soon after being hit by outflow.  For decades, storm observers have documented the death of numerous tornadoes when their parent circulations ( mesocyclones ) weaken after they become wrapped in outflow air -- either from the same thunderstorm or a different one.  The irony is that some kinds of thunderstorm outflow may help to  cause  tornadoes, while other forms of outflow may  kill  tornadoes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do tornadoes really skip?     Not in a literal sense, despite what you may have read in many older references, news stories, or even damage survey reports.  By definition (above), a tornado must be in  contact with the ground.  There is disagreement in meteorology over whether or not multiple touchdowns of the same vortex or  funnel cloud  mean different tornadoes (a strict interpretation).  In either event, stories of skipping tornadoes usually mean    There was continuous contact between vortex and ground in the path, but it was too weak to do damage;   Multiple tornadoes happened; but there was no survey done to precisely separate their paths (very common before the 1970s); or  There were multiple tornadoes with only short separation, but the survey erroneously classified them as one tornado.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      How long does a tornado last?    Tornadoes can last from several seconds to more than an hour.  The longest-lived tornado in history is really unknown, because so many of the long-lived tornadoes reported from the early-mid 1900s and before are believed to be tornado series instead.  Most tornadoes last less than 10 minutes.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How close to a tornado does the barometer drop?  And how far does it drop ?     It varies. A barometer can start dropping many hours or even days in advance of a tornado if there is low pressure on a broad scale moving into the area. Strong pressure falls will often happen as the mesocyclone (parent circulation in the thunderstorm) moves overhead or nearby. The biggest drop will be in the tornado itself, of course. It is very hard to measure pressure in tornadoes since most weather instruments can't survive. A few low-lying, armored probes called "" turtles "" have been placed successfully in tornadoes. This includes one deployment on 15 May 2003 by engineer/storm chaser Tim Samaras, who recorded pressure fall of over 40 millibars through an unusually large tornado. On 24 June 2003, another of Tim's probes recorded a  100 millibar  pressure plunge in a violent tornado near Manchester, SD ( National Geographic report ). Despite those spectacular results, and a few fortuitous passes over barometers through history, we still do not have a database of tornado pressures big enough to say much about average tornado pressures or other barometric characteristics.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a waterspout?    A waterspout is a  tornado over water  -- usually meaning non-supercell tornadoes over water.  Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast -- especially off southern Florida and the Keys -- and can happen over seas, bays and lakes worldwide.  Although waterspouts are always tornadoes by definition; they don't officially count in tornado records unless they hit land.  They are smaller and weaker than the most intense Great Plains tornadoes, but still can be quite dangerous.  Waterspouts can overturn small boats, damage ships, do significant damage when hitting land, and kill people.  The  National Weather Service  will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts can move onshore.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      How are tornadoes in the northern hemisphere different from tornadoes in the southern hemisphere?    The sense of rotation is usually the opposite. Most tornadoes -- but not all! -- rotate  cyclonically , which is counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise south of the equator.  Anticyclonic tornadoes  (clockwise-spinning in the northern hemisphere) have been observed, however -- usually in the form of waterspouts, non-supercell land tornadoes, or anticyclonic whirls around the rim of a supercell's mesocyclone. There have been several documented cases of cyclonic and anticyclonic tornadoes under the same thunderstorm at the same time. Anticyclonically rotating supercells with tornadoes are extremely rare; but  one struck near Sunnyvale, CA , in 1998. Remember, ""cyclonic"" tornadoes spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is a multivortex  tornado ?   Multivortex (a.k.a. multiple-vortex) tornadoes contain two or more small, intense  subvortices  orbiting the center of the larger tornado circulation.  When a tornado doesn't contain too much dust and debris,  they can sometimes be spectacularly  visible .  These vortices may form and die within a few seconds, sometimes appearing to train through the same part of the tornado one after another.  They can happen in all sorts of tornado sizes, from huge "" wedge "" tornadoes to narrow "" rope "" tornadoes. Subvortices are the cause of most of the narrow, short, extreme swaths of damage that sometimes arc through tornado tracks.  From the air, they can preferentially mow down crops and stack the stubble, leaving  cycloidal marks in fields .  Multivortex tornadoes are the source of most of the old stories from newspapers and other media before the late  20th century which told of several tornadoes seen together at once.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the original F-scale?    Dr. T. Theodore Fujita developed a damage scale (Fujita 1971, Fujita and Pearson 1973) for winds, including tornadoes, which was supposed to relate the degree of damage to the intensity of the wind.   This scale was the result.  The original F-scale should not be used anymore, because it has been replaced by  an enhanced version .  Tornado wind speeds are still largely unknown; and  the wind speeds on the original F-scale have never been scientifically tested and proven . Different winds may be needed to cause the same damage depending on how well-built a structure is, wind direction, wind duration,  battering by flying debris, and a bunch of other factors.  Also, the process of rating the damage itself is largely a judgment call -- quite inconsistent and arbitrary (Doswell and Burgess, 1988).  Even  meteorologists and engineers highly experienced in damage survey techniques often came up with different F-scale ratings for the same damage.  Even with all its flaws, the original F-scale was the only widely used tornado rating method for over three decades.  The  enhanced F-scale  takes effect 1 February 2007.   BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the Enhanced F-scale?     The Enhanced F-scale  ( simple table  or detailed  95 page PDF ) is a much more precise and robust way to assess tornado damage than the  original .  It classifies F0-F5 damage as calibrated by engineers and meteorologists across 28 different types of damage indicators (mainly various kinds of buildings, but also a few other structures as well as trees).  The idea is that a ""one size fits all"" approach just doesn't work in rating tornado damage, and that a tornado scale needs to take into account the typical strengths and weaknesses of different types of construction.  This is because the same wind does different things to different kinds of structures.  In the Enhanced F-scale, there will be different, customized standards for assigning any given F rating to a well built, well anchored wood-frame house compared to a garage, school, skyscraper, unanchored house, barn, factory, utility pole or other type of structure.  In a real-life tornado track, these ratings can be mapped together more smoothly to make a damage analysis.  Of course, there still will be gaps and weaknesses on a track where there was little or nothing to damage, but such problems will be less common than under the  original F-scale .  As with the original F-scale, the enhanced version will rate the tornado as a whole based on most intense damage within the path.    There are no plans to systematically re-evaluate historical tornadoes using the Enhanced F-scale.   A full PDF document on the Enhanced F-scale is online .  BACK UP TO THE TOP        So if the original F-scale winds are just guesses, why are they so specific?    Excellent question.  Those winds were arbitrarily attached to the damage scale based on 12-step mathematical interpolation between the hurricane criteria of the  Beaufort wind scale , and the threshold for Mach 1 (738 mph).  Though the F-scale actually peaks at F12 (Mach 1), only F1 through F5 are used in practice, with F0 attached for tornadoes of winds weaker than hurricane force.  Again, F-scale wind-to-damage relationships are untested, unknown and purely hypothetical.  They have never been proven and may not represent real tornadoes.  F-scale winds should not be taken literally.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      I heard the Oklahoma City tornado was almost ""F6.""  Is that a real  level on the original F-scale?    Only in untested theory.  Fujita plotted hypothetical winds higher than F5; but as mentioned in the previous answer above, they were only guesses.  Even if the winds measured by portable Doppler radar (32 meters above ground level, roughly 302 mph)  had been over 318 mph, the tornado would still be rated ""only"" F5 since F5 is the  most intense possible damage level .  On the  Enhanced F-scale , there is no such thing as ""F6.""    BACK UP TO THE TOP        What is a ""significant"" tornado?    A tornado is classified as ""significant"" if it does F2 or greater damage on the  Enhanced F scale . Grazulis (1993) also included killer tornadoes of any damage scale in his significant tornado database.   It is important to know that those definitions are arbitrary, for scientific research.  No tornado is  necessarily  in significant.  Any tornado can kill or cause damage; and some tornadoes rated less than F2  probably could do F2 or greater damage if they hit a well-built house during peak intensity.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       Big  fat tornadoes are the strongest ones, right?     Not necessarily. There is a statistical trend (as  documented  by NSSL's Harold Brooks) toward wide tornadoes having higher  F-scale  damage.  This can be out of more strength or out of greater opportunity for targets to damage -- or some blend of both.  However, the size or shape of  any particular tornado  does not say anything conclusive about its strength.  Some small "" rope ""  tornadoes can still do violent damage of  F4 or F5 ; and some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have  produced only weak damage of  F0 to F1 .    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Can't  we weaken or destroy tornadoes somehow, like by bombing them or sucking out their heat with a bunch of dry ice?    The main problem with anything which could  realistically stand a chance at affecting a tornado (e.g., hydrogen bomb) is that it would be even more deadly and  destructive than the tornado itself.  Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)  would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the  tornado much anyway.  Imagine the legal problems one would face, too, by trying to bomb or ice a tornado, then  inadvertently hurting someone or destroying private property in the process.  In short -- bad idea!  BACK UP TO THE TOP       How does cloud seeding affect tornadoes?    Nobody knows, for certain. There is no proof that seeding can or cannot change tornado potential in a thunderstorm.   This is because there is no way to know that the things a thunderstorm does after seeding would not have happened  anyway . This includes any presence or lack of rain, hail, wind gusts or tornadoes. Because the effects of seeding are impossible to prove  or disprove, there is a great deal of controversy in meteorology about whether it works, and if so, under what conditions, and  to what extent.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What does a tornado sound like?     That depends on what it is hitting, its size, intensity, closeness and other factors.  The most common tornado sound is a  continuous rumble, like a closeby train.  Sometimes a tornado produces a loud whooshing sound, like that of a waterfall or of open car windows while driving very fast.  Tornadoes which are tearing through densely populated areas may be producing all kinds of  loud noises at once, which collectively may make a tremendous roar.   Just because you may have heard a loud roar during a damaging storm does not necessarily mean it was a tornado .  Any intense thunderstorm wind can produce damage and cause a roar.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get tornado pictures?     Photographic   prints of tornadoes are sold by a number of storm chasers  and by the  NSEA Concession . You can see many interesting free weather images at  http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/noaa_products/ . There are also several stock photography agencies specializing in, or peddling on the side, weather photos which include tornadoes. A search engine can help you find online stock photo outfits and tornado photographs. For digital online photos, many tornado-related websites display images; but since all personal photography is legally copyrighted upon creation. Photos on this site and all National Oceanic and Atmospheric (NOAA) agencies, including the National Weather Service, are public domain and free to download, though credit to the agency and/or source is required.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Where can I get video of tornadoes?    Public-domain videos of National Severe Storms Lab tornado intercept footage are available for a reproduction fee through a  video transfer service  used by NSSL.  Many production companies, TV stations and storm chasers have made videotapes of tornadoes available for sale as well.  Try web search engines and storm chaser pages.  This FAQ will not endorse any particular commercial tornado video source or tour operation.   BACK UP TO THE TOP         Do hurricanes and tropical storms produce tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  There are great differences from storm to storm, not  necessarily  related to tropical cyclone size or intensity.  Some landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. fail to produce any known tornadoes, while others cause major outbreaks.  The same hurricane also may have none for awhile, then erupt with tornadoes...or vice versa!  Andrew (1992), for example, spawned several tornadoes across the Deep South after crossing the Gulf, but produced none during its rampage across South Florida.  Katrina (2005) spawned numerous tornadoes after its devastating LA/MS landfall, but only one in Florida (in the Keys).  Though fewer tornadoes tend to occur with tropical depressions and tropical storms than hurricanes, there are notable exceptions like TS Beryl of 1994 in the Carolinas.  Some tropical cyclones even produce two distinct sets of tornadoes -- one around the time of landfall over Florida or the Gulf Coast,  the other when well inland or exiting the Atlantic coast.   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What's the nature of tornadoes in hurricanes and tropical storms?        Hurricane-spawned tornadoes  tend to occur in small, low-topped supercells  within the outer bands, NNW through ESE of the center -- mainly the northeast quadrant.  There, the orientation and speed of the winds create  vertical shear profiles somewhat resembling those around  classic Great Plains supercells  -- the shear being in a shallower layer but often stronger.  Occasionally a tornado will happen in the inner bands as well, but the large majority still form  outside  the hurricane force wind zone.  Because tornado-producing circulations in hurricane supercells tend to be smaller and shorter-lived than their Midwest counterparts,  they are harder to detect on  Doppler radar , and more difficult to warn for.  But hurricane-spawned tornadoes can still be quite deadly and destructive,  as shown by the F3 tornado from Hurricane Andrew at La Place LA (1992, 2 killed) and an F4 tornado at Galveston TX from Hurricane Carla  (1961, 8 killed).    BACK UP TO THE TOP       Do tropical cyclones produce  waterspouts ?       Yes.  Waterspouts -- tornadoes over water -- have been observed in tropical systems.  We don't know how many of them happen in tropical cyclones, but a majority probably are from supercells.  The similarity in  Doppler radar  velocity signatures over water to tornado-producing cells in landfalling hurricanes suggests that it may be common -- and yet another good reason for ships to steer well clear of tropical cyclones.     BACK UP TO THE TOP       Does tropical cyclone strength or size matter for tornadoes?       Often, but not always.  Relatively weak hurricanes like Danny (1985) have spawned significant supercell tornadoes well inland, as have larger, more intense storms like Beulah (1967) and Ivan (2004).  In general, the bigger and stronger the wind fields are with a tropical cyclone, the bigger the area of favorable wind shear for supercells and tornadoes.  But supercell tornadoes (whether or not in tropical cyclones) also depend on instability, lift and moisture.  Surface moisture isn't lacking in a tropical cyclone, but sometimes instability and lift are too weak.  This is why tropical systems tend to produce more tornadoes in the daytime and near any fronts that may get involved in the cyclone circulation.  It is also why SPC won't  always  have tornado watches out for every instance of a tropical cyclone affecting land.  For more details, there is a set of articles on tropical cyclone tornadoes  listed in the  Scientific References  section.  For more information on hurricanes, go to the  Tropical Cyclone FAQ  by Chris Landsea, Neal Dorst and Erica Rule.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      TORNADO FORECASTING      Who forecasts tornadoes?       In the U.S., only the National Weather Service (NWS) issues tornado forecasts nationwide. Warnings come from   each NWS office . The   Storm Prediction Center  issues  watches , general  severe weather outlooks , and  mesoscale discussions . Tornadoes in Canada are handled by the   Meteorological Service of Canada . Very few other nations have specific tornado watch and warning services.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do you forecast tornadoes?      This is  a  very  simple question with no simple answer!  Here is a  very  generalized view from the perspective of a severe weather forecaster: When predicting severe weather (including tornadoes) a day or two in advance, we look for  the development of temperature and wind flow patterns in the atmosphere which can cause enough  moisture, instability, lift, and wind shear  for tornadic thunderstorms. Those are the four needed ingredients.  But it is not as easy as it sounds.  ""How much is enough"" of those is not a hard fast number, but varies a lot from situation to situation -- and sometimes is unknown!  A large variety of weather patterns can lead to tornadoes; and often, similar patterns may produce no severe weather at all.  To further complicate it, the various computer models we use days in advance can have major biases and flaws when the forecaster tries to interpret them on the scale of thunderstorms.  As the event gets closer, the forecast usually (but not always) loses some uncertainty and narrows down to a more precise threat area.  [At SPC, this is the   transition from outlook to mesoscale discussion to watch .]  Real-time weather observations -- from satellites, weather stations, balloon packages, airplanes, wind profilers and radar-derived winds -- become more and more critical the sooner the thunderstorms are expected; and the models become less important.  To figure out where the thunderstorms will form, we must do some hard, short-fuse detective work:  Find out the location, strength and movement of the fronts,  drylines, outflows, and other boundaries between air masses which tend to provide lift.  Figure out the moisture and temperatures -- both near ground and aloft -- which will help storms form and stay alive in this situation.  Find the wind structures in the atmosphere which can make a thunderstorm rotate as a  supercell , then produce  tornadoes .  [Many supercells never spawn a tornado!]  Make an educated guess where the most favorable combination of  ingredients will be and when; then draw the areas and type the forecast.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       That sounds really hard.   What  hardware and software tools do you use to help you forecast tornadoes?    The most important hardware for forecasting at the  Storm Prediction Center  is the human hand.  Numerous  hand-drawn analyses  of surface and upper-air data are still performed at SPC every day so forecasters can be intimately familiar with the weather features.  SPC forecasters also use high-performance computer workstations (mainly running Unix and Windows 98), with a huge variety of software to display the things we need to help us forecast severe weather.  The variety of those things is enormous:  many kinds of  computer model displays ,  satellite  image  loops,  radar displays ,  wind profiler  and  radar-wind plots ,  data from surface weather stations ,   upper air data from balloons  and planes,  lightning strike plots ,  weather data tables ,  multiple-source overlays , and more. It may sound trite; but by far, the most important software in the tornado forecast process is within the human brain.  The forecaster must use it to sort all that information, toss out what is not needed,  properly interpret what is needed, and put it into a coherent form -- all on a time deadline.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is needed to be a good tornado forecaster?    It all starts with...    Motivation:  Almost all severe storms forecasters are passionate about violent weather, with an intense desire to learn about and become better at predicting it.  For many, this dates back into childhood -- a first-hand encounter with violent storms, images on TV or in books and magazines, or even a deep attraction to storms which goes back too far to recall.  Others start out in other fields or college majors, then became fascinated with severe weather.  In any case, this desire leads to...  Education:  Consistently good severe storms forecasters have a solid educational background in atmospheric science which allows them to understand ""textbook"" concepts of thunderstorm formation.  They don't stop with their college education, either.  They constantly re-educate themselves in the latest discoveries about severe thunderstorms and tornadoes -- reading scientific journal articles on cutting-edge research, perhaps doing some research themselves.  The understanding of storms which results lets the forecaster think of ""conceptual models"" -- visualizations of what the storms will do and how.  Flexibility:  Because the atmosphere doesn't read textbooks or science journals, the forecaster must adapt those ""classroom"" ideas to  an endless variety of day-to-day situations which may look a lot different.  He or she also should be able to recognize when and why a forecast is not working out, and make the right adjustments.  These skills come from...  Experience:  In meteorology, history never repeats itself exactly.  But certain types of situations do recur, allowing the forecaster to set a mental  benchmark for what to expect.  From there, he or she can better decide what data will be most important to examine, and what data  will not be as relevant to the situation.  Experienced forecasters are able to learn how bad forecasts went wrong and how good forecasts worked each time, building a more complete mental warehouse of severe storm forecast knowledge as time passes.  When the experience is  continually blended with motivation, flexibility and more education, he or she will keep improving as a forecaster.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       What is the tornado forecast for next spring?  Are there going to be tornadoes in Iowa the week of next October 5?     We  just don't know.  Tornado forecasting today and tomorrow is quite difficult already.  Specific severe weather forecasting more than days in advance is little more than guessing, or using tornado climatology for the forecast area and time of year.  For that  reason, there is no such thing as a long range severe storm or tornado forecast.  There are simply too  many small-scale variables involved which we cannot reliably measure or model weeks or months ahead of time; so no scientific forecasters even attempt them.  Our farthest convective  outlook is for day-3, and can be found on the  SPC Forecasts page . Perhaps, someday, the density of weather observations and atmospheric modeling capabilities will advance  enough to allow us to do severe storms forecasting many days out with some degree of accuracy better than a coin toss.  We are a long, long way from that kind of forecasting!  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What  is the role of Doppler radar in tornado forecasting?    Each NWS forecast office uses output from at least one  Doppler radar  in the area to help to determine if a  warning  is needed. Doppler radar signatures can tell warning meteorologists a great deal about a thunderstorm's structure, but usually can't see the tornado itself.  This is because the radar beam gets too wide to resolve even the biggest tornadoes within a few tens of miles after leaving the transmitter.  Instead, a radar indicates strong winds blowing toward and away from it in a way that tells forecasters, ""An intense circulation probably exists in this storm and a tornado is possible.""  Possible doesn't mean certain, though.  That is why local forecasters must also depend on spotter reports,  SPC forecast guidance  on the general severe weather threat, and in-house analysis of the weather situation over the region containing thunderstorms, to make the best-informed warning decisions.    BACK UP TO THE TOP      What was the first  successful tornado forecast?    Nobody knows when was the first time someone claimed a tornado would occur in an area, and it happened.  But the first documented, successful tornado forecast by meteorologists was on March 25, 1948, by  Air Force Capt. (later Col.) Robert Miller  and  Major Ernest Fawbush .  After they noticed striking similarities in the developing weather pattern to others which produced tornadoes  (including the Tinker AFB, OK, tornado several days before), Fawbush and Miller advised their superior officer of a tornado threat in central Oklahoma that evening.  Compelled from above to issue a yes/no decision on a tornado forecast after  thunderstorms developed in western Oklahoma, they put out the word of possible tornadoes, and the base carried out safety precautions. A few hours later, despite the tiny odds of a repeat, the second tornado in five days directly hit the base.  For more insight into this event, Charlie Crisp has transcribed the late Col. Miller's recollections of the event; and they   are now online .   BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is the history of tornado forecasting?     It's too long and eventful to summarize here; but there is an  online guide  at NSSL, as well as a  timeline of SELS and SPC , and a  history of the SPC  that provide insight into how tornado prediction has evolved.  There is also an entire book devoted to the subject:   Scanning the Skies : A History of Tornado Forecasting  by Marlene Bradford (hardcover - March 2001).   Some libraries, bookstores and online book sellers carry this comprehensive and detailed history work.     BACK UP TO THE TOP      Was tornado forecasting once banned in the U.S.?      Yes.  Before 1950, at various stages of development of the Weather Bureau, the use of the word ""tornado"" in forecasts was at times strongly discouraged and at other times forbidden, because of a fear that predicting tornadoes may cause panic.  This was in an era when very little was known about tornadoes compared to today, by both scientists and the public at large.  Tornadoes were, for most, dark and mysterious menaces of unfathomable power, fast-striking monsters from the sky capable of sudden and unpredictable acts of death and devastation.  As the weather patterns which led to major tornado events became better documented and researched, the mystery behind predicting them began to clear -- a process which still is far from complete, of course.  In 1950, the Weather Bureau  revoked the ban  (PDF) on mentioning tornadoes in forecasts.  BACK UP TO THE TOP        How has SPC performed with tornado forecasting?     By  most measures, SPC (formerly SELS, NSSFC) has improved its tornado forecasting over the past few decades. There are many ways to objectively gauge forecast performance -- for example,  verifying tornado watches with tornado reports  and  both watch types by all severe reports . The general trend from 1985-2003 has been for a greater percentage of tornado watches to contain tornadoes.    BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO DAMAGE      How is tornado damage rated?    The most widely used method worldwide, for over three decades, was the  F-scale  developed by Dr. T. Theodore Fujita.  In the U.S., and probably elsewhere within a few years, the new  Enhanced F-scale  is becoming the standard for assessing tornado damage. In Britain,  there is a  scale  similar to the original F-scale but with more divisions; for more info, go to   the TORRO scale website .  In both original F- and TORRO-scales, the wind speeds are based on calculations of the   Beaufort wind scale  and have never been scientifically verified in real tornadoes.  Enhanced F-scale winds are derived from engineering guidelines but still are only judgmental estimates.  Because:   Nobody knows the ""true"" wind speeds at ground level in most tornadoes, and   The amount of wind needed to do similar-looking damage can vary greatly, even from block to block or building to building,    ...damage rating is (at best) an exercise in educated guessing.  Even experienced damage-survey meteorologists and wind engineers  can and often do disagree among themselves on a tornado's strength.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Who  surveys tornado damage?  What's the criteria for the National Weather Service to do a survey?    This varies from place to place; and there is no rigid criteria. The responsibility for damage survey decisions at  each NWS office  usually falls on the Warning-Coordination Meteorologist (WCM) and/or the Meteorologist in Charge (MIC). Budget constraints keep every tornado path from having a direct ground survey by NWS personnel; so  spotter, chaser  and news accounts may be used to rate relatively weak, remote or brief tornadoes. Killer tornadoes, those striking densely populated areas, or those generating reports of exceptional damage are given highest priority for ground surveys.  Most ground surveys involve the WCM and/or forecasters not having shift responsibility the day of the survey.  For outbreaks and unusually destructive events -- usually only a few times a year -- the NWS may support involvement by highly experienced damage survey experts and wind engineers from elsewhere in the country.  Aerial  surveys are expensive and usually reserved for tornado events with multiple casualties and/or massive degrees of damage. Sometimes, local NWS offices may have a cooperative agreement with local media or police to use their helicopters during surveys.   BACK UP TO THE TOP        How can a tornado destroy one house and leave the next one almost unscratched?    Most of the time, this happens either with  multiple-vortex  tornadoes or very small, intense single-vortex tornadoes.  The winds in most of a  multivortex tornado  may only be strong enough to do minor damage to a particular house.  But one of the smaller embedded subvortices, perhaps only a few dozen feet across, may strike the house next door with winds over 200 mph, causing complete destruction. Also, there can be great differences in construction from one building to the next, so that even in the same wind speed, one may be flattened while the other is barely nicked.  For example, a flimsy, unanchored mobile home may be  obliterated while all surrounding objects suffer little or no damage .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How do tornadoes  do some weird things, like drive straw into trees,  strip road pavement and drive splinters into bricks?    The list of bizarre things attributed to tornadoes is almost endless. Much of it is folklore; but there are some weird scenes in tornado damage. Asphalt pavement may strip when tornado winds sandblast the edges with gravel and other small detritus, eroding the edges and causing chunks to peel loose from the road base. Storm chasers and damage surveyors have observed this phenomenon often after the passage of a violent tornado. With a specially designed cannon,   wind engineers at Texas Tech University  have fired boards and other objects at over 100 mph into various types of construction materials, duplicating some of the kinds of ""bizarre"" effects, such as wood splinters embedded in bricks. Intense winds can bend a tree or other objects, creating cracks in which debris (e.g., hay straw) becomes lodged before the tree straightens and the crack tightens shut again. All bizarre damage effects have a physical cause inside the roiling maelstrom of tornado winds. We don't fully understand what some of those causes are yet, however; because much of it is almost impossible to simulate in a lab.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      I've heard about  tornadoes picking up objects and carrying them for miles.  Does this happen? Who does research on it?    Yes, numerous tornadoes have lofted (mainly light) debris many miles into the sky, which was then carried by middle- and upper-atmospheric winds for long distances. The vertical winds in tornadoes can be strong enough to temporarily levitate even heavy objects if they have a large face to the wind or flat sides (like roofs, walls, trees and cars),  and are strong enough to carry lightweight objects tens of thousands of feet high.  Though the heaviest objects, such as railroad cars, can only be airborne for short distances, stories of checks and other papers found over 100 miles  away are often true. The Worcester MA tornado of 9 June 1953 carried mattress pieces high into the thunderstorm, where they were coated in ice, before they fell into Boston Harbor. Pilots reported seeing debris fluttering through the air at high altitude near the thunderstorm which spawned the Ruskin Heights MO tornado of 20 May 1957. There is a   research group at the University of Oklahoma  which studies tornado debris flight. If you personally know of a case of tornado debris carried long-distance, they have a hotline you can call to report it.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      How does the damage from tornadoes compare to that of hurricanes?     The differences are in scale.  Even though winds from the strongest tornadoes far exceed that from the strongest hurricanes, hurricanes typically cause much more damage individually and over a season, and over far bigger areas.  Economically, tornadoes cause about a tenth as much damage per year, on average, as hurricanes.  Hurricanes tend to cause much more overall destruction than tornadoes because of their much larger size, longer duration and their greater variety of ways to damage property.  The destructive core in hurricanes can be tens of miles across, last many hours and damage structures through storm surge and rainfall-caused flooding, as well as from wind.  Tornadoes, in contrast, tend to be a few hundred yards in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause damage from their extreme winds.      Where can I find free pictures of tornado damage?        We have some public domain images of typical examples of F0 through F5 tornado damage linked from this FAQ's  F-scale page .   Otherwise, public-domain tornado damage pictures are scattered among various National Weather Service websites.   Because web addresses change so often, we don't maintain a listing of them here; but you can start your search at  this map of all NWS websites . Browse around for damage survey photos in severe weather and tornado event sections of  local NWS office pages ; and  please make sure the photos are not copyrighted before using them . If there are any doubts, or to get permission to use copyrighted  material, e-mail the webmaster at that office.  SPC  has some public-domain images and descriptions of Spencer, SD tornado damage available  here . If you want hardcopies for research projects, the best bet is to download and print public-domain images from a high-quality color printer. Even when using public-domain images, you should give proper credit to the source. Historical archives at local and college libraries might have public-domain hardcopy prints of historical tornado damage in your area.  BACK UP TO THE TOP       TORNADO SAFETY      What should I do in case of a tornado?    That depends on where you are.   This list of tornado safety tips  covers most situations.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado watch?      A  tornado  watch defines an area shaped like a parallelogram, where tornadoes and other kinds of severe  weather are possible in the next several hours.  It does not mean tornadoes are imminent -- just that you need  to be alert, and to be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes do happen or a warning is issued.  This is the time to turn on local TV or radio, turn on and set the alarm switch on your weather radio, make sure you have ready access to safe shelter, and make your friends and family aware of the potential for tornadoes in the area.  The  Storm Prediction Center  issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches;  here is an example .  For more information on tornado watches and other SPC bulletins,  go here .  BACK UP TO THE TOP      What is a tornado warning?    A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted, or that  Doppler radar  indicates a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado. When a tornado warning is issued for your town or county, take immediate   safety  precautions.  local NWS offices  issue tornado warnings.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Do  mobile homes attract tornadoes?    Of course not.  It may seem that way, considering most tornado deaths occur in them, and that some of the most graphic reports of tornado damage come from mobile home communities.  The reason for this is that mobile homes are, in general, much easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office buildings.  A brief, relatively weak tornado which may have gone undetected in the wilderness -- or  misclassified as severe straight-line thunderstorm winds while doing minor damage to sturdy houses -- can  blow a mobile home apart .  Historically, mobile home parks have been reliable  indicators , not attractors, of tornadoes.  BACK UP TO THE TOP      Long ago, I was told to open windows to equal  "

May 3, 1999 Oklahoma/Kansas tornado outbreak         Tornado safety                    TOTO               Where do they come from?       Tornadoes come from the energy released in a thunderstorm. As powerful as they     are, tornadoes account for only a tiny fraction of the energy in a thunderstorm.     What makes them dangerous is that their energy is concentrated in a small     area, perhaps only a hundred yards across. Not all tornadoes are the same,     of course, and science does not yet completely understand how part of a thunderstorm's     energy sometimes gets focused into something as small as a tornado.   Where do they occur?    Whenever and wherever conditions are right, tornadoes are possible, but they   are most common in the central plains of North America, east of the Rocky Mountains   and west of the Appalachian Mountains. They occur mostly during the spring   and summer; the tornado season comes early in the south and later in the north   because spring comes later in the year as one moves northward. They usually   occur during the late afternoon and early evening. However, they have been   known to occur in every state in the United States, on any day of the year,   and at any hour. They also occur in many other parts of the world, including   Australia, Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America.    If you'd like to  plot     tornado tracks , download Severe Plot   and the associated data from the NOAA Storm Prediction Center.     What type of damage can they do?     The damage from tornadoes comes from the strong winds they   contain. It is generally believed that tornadic wind speeds can be as high   as 300 mph in the most violent tornadoes. Wind speeds that high can cause automobiles   to become airborne, rip ordinary homes to shreds, and turn broken glass and   other debris into lethal missiles. The biggest threat to living creatures (including   humans) from tornadoes is from flying debris and from being tossed about in   the wind. It used to be believed that the low pressure in a tornado contributed   to the damage by making buildings ""explode"" but this is no longer believed   to be true.    How are tornadoes detected?    Today, the development of Doppler radar has made it possible,   under certain circumstances, to detect a tornado's winds with a radar. However,   human beings remain an important part of the system to detect tornadoes, because   not all tornadoes occur in situations where the radar can ""see"" them. Ordinary   citizen volunteers make up what is called the  SKYWARN  network   of storm spotters, who work with their local communities to watch for approaching   tornadoes, so those communities can take appropriate action in the event of   a tornado. Spotter information is relayed to the National Weather Service,   which operates the national Doppler radar network and which issues warnings   to the public by radio, TV, and NOAA Weather Radio, using information obtained   from weather maps, weather radars, and local storm spotters.    Can tornadoes be predicted?     Yes, but only to a limited extent. Although the process by   which tornadoes form is not completely understood, scientific research has   revealed that tornadoes usually form under certain types of atmospheric conditions.   When forecasters see those conditions, they can predict that tornadoes are   likely to occur. However, it is not yet possible to predict in advance exactly   when and where they will develop, how strong they will be, or precisely what   path they will follow. There are some ""surprises"" every year, when tornadoes   form in situations that do not look like the right conditions in advance, but   these are becoming less frequent. Once a tornado is formed and has been detected,   warnings can be issued based on the path of the storm producing the tornado,   but even these cannot be perfectly precise about who will or will not be struck.    How fast can a tornado go?    We're not really sure what the highest wind speed might be   inside a tornado. Since strong and violent tornadoes destroy weather instruments.   we really only have measurements of the winds inside weaker tornadoes. Mobile   Doppler radars can measure wind speeds in a tornado above ground level -- and   the strongest was 318 mph measured on May 3, 1999 near Bridge Creek/Moore,   Oklahoma.    What are the people called who study tornadoes?    People who study tornadoes are just research meteorologists.   You may have heard another term - storm chaser - but that really refers to   people who chase tornadoes for a hobby. Research meteorologists do science.   They have to come up with questions they think they can answer by taking certain   measurements.    How fast do tornadoes move?    We don't have detailed statistics about this. Movement can   range from almost stationary to more than 60 mph. A typical tornado travels at around 10-20 miles per hour.    How long is a tornado usually on the ground?   Detailed statistics about the time a tornado is on the ground   are not available. This time can range from an instant to several hours. The   average is about five minutes.   Does NSSL do things like they showed in the movie ""Twister""?   The movie Twister was based upon work NSSL did in the mid-1980s   using a 55-gallon drum outfitted with various meteorological sensors. It was   called  TOTO  (TOtable Tornado Observatory). NSSL tried for several years to   put it in the path of an oncoming tornado, but had minimal success. It did   not have the sensors that fly up into the tornado, like in the movie. However,   that is not a bad idea and with all the advances being made in computer technology,   we might be able to do that someday.    Has every state had a tornado?   Yes, although some states have many more tornadoes than others.   Are there tornadoes in the Arctic Circle?    We are not aware of any tornadoes occurring in the Arctic Circle.   Tornadoes need moisture and warm air to form, which is unusual at that lattitude.   Plus tornadoes or their evidence have to be observed by someone, and the Arctic   Circle has few residents!    Do tornadoes really stay away from gullies, rivers and mountains?   A gully could actually make a tornado more intense, just as   an ice skater spins faster when he or she stands up tall and stretches their   arms up straight over their heads. Every major river east of the Rockies has   been crossed by a significant tornado, and high elevations in the Appalachians,   Rockies, and Sierra Nevada have all experienced tornadoes. A violent tornado   crossed the Continental Divide in Yellowstone National Park.    Do tornadoes always come from a wall cloud?    A wall cloud is not always present. It is possible, though,   that you cannot see a wall cloud because of your viewing angle.    What does a tornado sound like?   People who have been in a tornado say it sounds like a jet   engine or a freight train and is very loud. They said it hurt their ears but   they were more worried about what might happen to them than they were about   the pain in their ears.    Can tornadoes be stopped?    You have to consider that the tornado is part of something   bigger - the supercell thunderstorm. Unless you disrupt the supercell thunderstorm   itself, you would likely have another tornado, even if you were able to destroy   the first. The thunderstorm's energy is much greater than the tornado. No one   has tried to disrupt the tornado because the methods to do so could likely   cause even more damage than the tornado. Detonating a hydrogen bomb, for example,   to disrupt a tornado would be even more deadly and destructive than the tornado   itself. Lesser things (like huge piles of dry ice or smaller conventional weaponry)   would be too hard to deploy in the right place fast enough, and would likely not have enough impact to affect the tornado much anyway.    How much advance warning can forecasters give us before a   tornado strikes?    The current average lead-time for tornado warnings is 11 minutes. NSSL is working to increase tornado warning lead-times to 20 minutes.   What is the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado   warning?    A tornado watch defines a box-shaped area where tornadoes   and other kinds of severe weather are possible in the next several hours. It   means that you need to be alert, and be prepared to go to safe shelter if tornadoes   happen or a warning is issued. If you have a NOAA Weather Radio and have it   set up correctly it will alert you to the watch. Tune in to local TV or radio   for more information. A tornado warning means that a tornado has been spotted,   or that Doppler radar shows a thunderstorm circulation which can spawn a tornado.   When a tornado warning is issued for your area, seek safe shelter immediately.   The Storm Prediction Center issues tornado and severe thunderstorm watches.   Your local National Weather Service offices issue tornado warnings.  Can a tornado dig up the ground?    There have been reports of tornadoes blowing dirt and creating   a trench 3 feet deep, but it is very uncommon. Tornadoes have been known to strip asphalt pavement.   What is the worst tornado that you know of?    The deadliest US tornadoes [more than one?] were in 1925 on   March 18. It is called the ""Tri-state"" tornado and killed 695 people along   its 219 mile track through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana.    Do tornadoes have a positive effect on the environment?    Not that we know of yet...but the thunderstorms that produce   tornadoes release energy that builds up in the atmosphere.    How many people are killed by tornadoes each year?   On the average tornadoes kill about 60 people each year, mostly   from flying or falling debris.    What would it be like to be in the eye of a tornado?    The very center of the tornado is probably almost calm, but   may have some downward motion in it. There have not been any direct measurements   of the winds because the instruments used to measure wind speed can't survive   long enough to measure the eye.    How many tornadoes hit the US each year?   About 1000    How often do  F4/F5 tornadoes occur?     Of the 1000 tornadoes that occur each year, about 2% of them   are rated F4 or F5. That means that there are as many as 20 devastating tornadoes   each year. It is possible that meteorologists have underestimated the number   of violent tornadoes that occur each year. Tornadoes are rated only by damage   they do to man-made structures. Therefore, if a tornado doesn't hit a structure   of some kind, we cannot estimate its strength. Also, a tornado varies in strength   during its lifetime and could be its strongest while between areas of houses   or other buildings.    Could there be an F-6 tornado?    Dr. Ted Fujita, the inventor of the ""F-scale"", did plot hypothetical   winds at an ""F6"" level. But, it was untested theory and therefore he was making   educated guesses. The F-scale is based on damage to man-made structures, not   precise wind speeds. Scientists have very few measurements of tornado winds.   F5 is the most intense possible damage level - total destruction. Fujita said   that although he speculated that a tornado could be stronger than an F5, even   a structural engineer could not distinguish F6 damage from F5. F5 is the highest   scientifically accepted rating for tornadoes. The highest recorded windspeed   in a tornado was 318 mph, still within the bounds of the F5 description. These   precise wind speed numbers are actually educated guesses and have never been   scientifically verified. As we obtain more measurements on tornadoes, we may   actually learn that the wind estimates on the Fujita scale are wrong! Damage   can vary from place to place or even building to building based on construction,   even if the wind speeds were the same.   What effect do El Niño/La Niña have on tornadoes?     There have only been two strong La Niña events. Although   scientists have looked for a correlation between La Niña and tornadoes,   there just isn't enough data to make any conclusions.   I have a theory about tornadoes, who do I talk to?    We receive   literally hundreds of ideas for observing, controlling, or stopping destructive   storms. Our scientists are likely to look at ideas that are investigated by   a researcher who publishes the results in a peer-reviewed journal. In this   way they can review, and if necessary, replicate the results, which then will suggest the next step to move the science forward.    How do I become a storm spotter?    Visit  www.skywarn.org   .   SKYWARN is a cooperative effort between the National Weather Service and communities   to organize spotters. On that site there is a link to local SKYWARN groups.   If your area is not listed, contact your local National Weather Service Office.    I would like to volunteer to help NSSL during a tornado intercept field project.    Unfortunately, government regulations   make it impossible to accept offers from the public to do volunteer field work   for any tornado intercept programs. Legal liability questions prevent NSSL   from accepting volunteers, even at their own risk.    I want to chase tornadoes on my vacation – what time of year and what locations are best?    Check   our Severe Weather Climatology page at  www.nssl.noaa.gov/hazard/     Which is stronger, a hurricane or tornado?    The winds from a strong tornado (F4 or F5 - 207 mph   or higher) are significantly stronger than the highest category of hurricane   (Saffir-Simpson Scale Category 4 or 5 - 131 mph and higher). However, hurricanes   tend to cause much more destruction than tornadoes because they cover a much   larger area, last longer, and have a variety of destructive forces (the eyewall,   storm surge, flooding, and sustained strong winds). Tornadoes, in contrast,   tend to be a mile or smaller in diameter, last for minutes and primarily cause   damage from their extreme winds.    Where is the most common birthplace for a violent tornado?    According to research done by Dr. Harold Brooks here at NSSL,   the most common birthplace for a violent tornado (F4 or greater) is in south-central   Oklahoma.    How is the strength of a tornado determined?    The most common   and practical way to determine the strength of a tornado is to look at the   damage it caused. From the damage, we can estimate wind speeds. Professor Theodore   Fujita developed a scale to help us evaluate damage and classify tornadoes.   In summary, the Fujita Scale ranges from F0-F5. F0 tornadoes have winds of   40-72 mph and can break branches off of trees and damage signs. F5 tornadoes   have winds from 261-318 mph, which can lift houses off foundations, and make   automobiles as dangerous as a missile flying through the air. A more complete   listing of the scale can be found at --  www.tornadoproject.com   ,   and click on ""The Fujita Scale"" either in the menu to the left or at the bottom.    An ""Enhanced   Fujita Scale"" will be implemented by the National Weather Service by   February, 2007. In a nutshell, the enhanced F scale was developed to rate tornadoes   in a more consistent and accurate manner. It will still rate tornado categories   from F0 to F5, but the ranges of wind speed in each category are now more accurate.   It takes into account more variables than the original scale did when assigning   a wind speed rating to a tornado, incorporating 28 damage indicators such as   building type, structures, and trees. For each damage indicator, there are   8 degrees of damage ranging from the beginning of visible damage to complete   destruction of the damage indicator. The original F scale did not take these details into account. The original F Scale historical data base will not change.   An F5 tornado rated years ago is still an F5, but the wind speed associated   with the tornado may have been somewhat less than previously estimated. A correlation   between the original F Scale and the EF Scale has been developed. This makes   it possible to express ratings in terms of one scale to the other, preserving the historical database.Go to:  www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/ef-scale.html     Do tornadoes target mobile home parks?    While it may appear tornadoes target mobile   home parks, they actually do not. An F1 tornado might do significant damage   to a mobile home, and cause minor damage to a site built home -- looking like   the tornado ""skipped"" the house. Mobile homes are, in general, much   easier for a tornado to damage and destroy than well-built houses and office   buildings. A mobile home, or manufactured home, by definition, is built at   a factory and taken to the place they will occupy--so they are much more affordable   than a house built on-site. Also, they are often built with lighter-weight materials, which do not hold up well in tornadic winds.    Straight-line winds can also destroy a mobile home as easily   as a tornado, especially one that is not anchored. Any wind gust that is sustained for 3 seconds over 50mph can cause damage to mobile homes.    These websites may   be of interest to you:      http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/mhdeadly.htm       http://www.ametsoc.org/POLICY/statement_2004_mobilehomes.html        http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/zine/archives/1-20/29/guest.html     Some states   are beginning to require storm shelters for their residents. The statistics   definitely support this --7% of our population lives in mobile homes, and almost   half of tornado fatalities in the U.S. occur in mobile homes. The problem of   warning and sheltering mobile home residents has become the biggest obstacle   to continuing to reduce death tolls from tornadoes.    Do wider tornadoes cause more damage?    There is a statistical trend toward wide tornadoes having   higher F-scale damage. This can be because of more strength or because of greater   opportunity for targets to damage - or a combination of both. However, the   size or shape of any particular tornado does not say anything conclusive about   its strength. Some small tornadoes can still do very violent damage of F4 or   F5. And, some very large tornadoes over a quarter-mile wide have produced only   weak damage.   What is the difference between a tornado and a cyclone?    A tornado   is a small-scale cyclonic circulation, and in the past, has been referred to as a cyclone.    The term cyclone was used to describe anything that rotated   counterclockwise, so often tornado (a small-scale cyclonic circulation) and   cyclone were interchangeable. However, modern meteorology now restricts the   use of the term to the larger-scale circulations -- usually also accompanied   by low pressure and bad weather. But, people still use it both ways.    Are there electromagnetic or magnetohydrodynamic explanations for the development of tornadoes?    As far as scientists understand,   tornadoes are formed and sustained by a purely thermodynamic process. As a   result, their research efforts are towards that end. They have spent a lot   of time modeling the formation of a tornado and measuring many parameters in   and around a tornado when it is forming and going through its life cycle. They   have not seen any evidence to support magnetism or electricity playing a role.   Can my TV signal detect tornadoes?    You may have read about   a technique called ""the   Weller Method"" of tornado detection. The idea was to be able to use your   TV as a lightning detector to detect the radio waves emitted by a lightning   flash, with the assumption that tornadic thunderstorms were very active lightning   producers. But, not all tornadic storms produce large amounts of lightning.   And, TV's are all different and have different sensitivities, and some are   even made to filter out lightning signals. Plus, if you are connected to cable,   it won't work. The method was found to be completely unreliable and it has mostly been abandoned.    Do tornadoes occur when it is cold?    There is no   particular temperature at which tornadoes form. It is more about what the surface   temperature is in relation to the temperature higher up in the atmosphere.   Even if it is cold near the surface, as long as it is colder higher up, the   winds are right to set up low-level wind shear, along with other necessary ingredients, a tornado is possible.    What direction do tornadoes spin?    Most tornadoes (but not all) in the Northern Hemisphere spin counterclockwise.    Do rocks, hills, or trees increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado?    Unfortunately,   there is no clear answer. Both observations (of real tornadoes), computer simulations,   and laboratory studies (in tornado vortex chambers) have shown that the ""surface   roughness"", i.e., the measure of how disrupted the wind near the ground   is by objects such as dirt, rocks, hills, trees, and even houses, can either   increase or decrease the wind speeds in a tornado. How can trees increase the   wind speeds? Well, the strongest winds in a tornado occur when air from outside   the tornado can flow closest to the center of the vortex. The conservation   of angular momentum, e.g., the rotation in the air, requires that as the air   flows toward the center of the tornado (as it spirals in) its rotation must   increase. Depending on the configuration of the airflow outside of the tornado,   sometimes there is not ENOUGH ""inflow"" toward the center, and so   blobs of air outside the tornado do not get very close to the center of rotation   before they are lifted upward off the ground. In this case, INCREASING the   surface roughness helps get these blobs of air closer to the center of the   tornado, where they rotate even faster than before. So occasionally we see   in tornado videos the vortex increasing in intensity when it travels from one   type of ground surface (say a field) into a grove of trees or a housing subdivision.   It does not always happen, but often enough that we are aware of it. This is   a case where ""friction"", which people normally think of slowing things down, actually speeds them up!    Can you recommend a good storm shelter manufacturer?   We do not endorse any particular company or type of storm shelter.   Consider checking out the Federal Emergency Management Agency website at  fema.gov   . They work with communities on tornado preparedness.   How can I keep my kids safe during a tornado?    Educate yourself and your kids about tornado safety.   Being informed and having a plan of action is the best way to keep you and   your family safe. Work out together where you will go in case a tornado is   approaching and why. Have the kids put together a tornado kit, with games,   books, cars, and even snacks to keep them busy while they are taking shelter – make   them a part of the process. Use a NOAA Weather Radio and show the kids how   it can alert your family to danger. NSSL developed  coloring   books for kids   a few years ago – it may be helpful to print them   out and review them with your kids.    Most tornado injuries are caused   by flying debris, so the best thing for you to do is probably lay on top of   your child and cover both of you with a mattress or a couch cushion. Strap   infants in their car seat (in the house of course), and put bicycle helmets   on the other children to protect their heads. Make sure everyone had sturdy   shoes (not sandals) and jeans. See our  severe   weather safety page .    Check out   books from the library about tornadoes. It seems the more we understand something, the less we fear it.    Plus, there are much more dangerous weather events than   tornadoes. Flash floods are the number one weather-related killer in the U.S.,   followed by lightning. There are an average of 1000 tornadoes a year, killing about 40-50 people each year.    Is it safe to take shelter under an overpass?   Absolutely not! Stopping under a bridge to take shelter from a tornado is a very dangerous idea, for several reasons:         Deadly flying debris     can still be blasted into the spaces between bridge and grade -- and severely     injure any people taking shelter there.      Even when strongly gripping the girders (if     they exist), people may be blown loose, out from under the bridge and into     the open -- possibly well up into the tornado itself. Chances for survival     are not good if that happens.     The bridge itself may fail, peeling apart     and creating large flying objects, or even collapsing down onto people underneath.     The structural integrity of many bridges in tornado winds is unknown -- even     for those that may look sturdy.      Whether or not the tornado hits, parking     on traffic lanes is illegal and dangerous to yourself and others. It creates     a potentially deadly hazard for others, who may plow into your vehicle at     full highway speeds in the rain, hail, and/or dust. Also, it can trap people     in the storm's path against their will, or block emergency vehicles from     saving lives.      What should I do if there is a tornado warning while I am at     work at a hospital or nursing home?    Your medical director or nursing home     administrator should have a disaster plan for you to review. Most accredited     medical facilities are required to have a disaster plan on file, including     procedures during tornadoes, and to review that plan annually with the staff.       Are crawl spaces safe tornado shelters?    Crawl spaces are generally not considered     safe shelter from tornadoes because it is hard to know how well the house     is attached to the foundation. If a tornado moved the house a foot or two,     and this happens a lot, the entire house could drop on you. Plus, lots of     unwelcome critters live in crawl spaces and it doesn't sound very safe to     spend time with spiders and snakes!    Where is tornado alley?    ""Tornado Alley"" is a just a nickname made up by the media for an area of relatively     high tornado occurrence - it is not a clearly defined area. Is tornado alley     the area with the most violent tornadoes, or is it the area with the most     tornado related deaths, or the highest frequency or tornadoes? It depends     on what kind of information you want!

A SEVERE WEATHER PRIMER:     Questions and Answers about TORNADOES      home   »  education   »  severe weather primer  » tornado         TORNADO FAQs           Where do tornadoes come from?        How fast can a tornado go?        What are the people called who study tornadoes?        How fast do tornadoes move?       How long is a tornado usually on the ground?        Does NSSL do things like they showed in the movie ""Twister""?       What direction do tornadoes spin?         Tornadoes come from the energy released in a thunderstorm. As powerful as they are, tornadoes account for only a tiny fraction of the energy in a thunderstorm. What makes them dangerous is that their energy is concentrated in a small area, perhaps only a hundred yards across. Not all tornadoes are the same, of course, and science does not yet completely understand how part of a thunderstorm's energy sometimes gets focused into something as small as a tornado.      We're not really sure what the highest wind speed might be inside a tornado. Since strong and violent tornadoes destroy weather instruments, we really only have measurements of the winds inside weaker tornadoes. Mobile Doppler radars can measure wind speeds in a tornado above ground level -- and the strongest was 318 mph measured on May 3, 1999 near Bridge Creek/Moore, Oklahoma.     People who study tornadoes are just research meteorologists. You may have heard another term - storm chaser - but that really refers to people who chase tornadoes for a hobby. Research meteorologists do science. They have to come up with questions they think they can answer by taking certain measurements.     We don't have detailed statistics about this. Movement can range from almost stationary to more than 60 mph. A typical tornado travels at around 10-20 miles per hour.     Detailed statistics about the time a tornado is on the ground are not available. This time can range from an instant to several hours. The average is about five minutes.     The movie Twister was based upon work NSSL did in the mid-1980s using a 55-gallon drum outfitted with various meteorological sensors. It was called TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory). NSSL tried for several years to put it in the path of an oncoming tornado, but had minimal success. It did not have the sensors that fly up into the tornado, like in the movie. However, that is not a bad idea and with all the advances being made in computer technology, we might be able to do that someday.

A tornado is a narrow, violently rotating column of air that extends from   the base of a thunderstorm to the ground. Because wind is invisible, you can't   always see a tornado. A visible sign of the tornado,   a  condensation funnel  made up of water droplets, sometimes forms and may or   may not touch the ground during the tornado lifecycle. Dust and debris in the   rotating column also make a tornado visible and confirm its presence.    What is known?    Tornadoes are the most violent of all atmospheric storms.    There are two types of tornadoes: those that come from a supercell thunderstorm,   and those that do not.   Tornadoes that form from a  supercell  thunderstorm are     the most common, and often the most dangerous. A supercell is a long-lived     (greater than 1 hour) and highly organized storm feeding off an  updraft  (a     rising current of air) that is tilted and rotating. This rotating updraft     - as large as 10 miles in diameter and up to 50,000 feet tall - can be present     as much as 20 to 60 minutes before a tornado forms. Scientists call this     rotation a  mesocyclone  when     it is detected by Doppler radar. The tornado is a very small extension of     this larger rotation. Most large and violent tornadoes come from supercells.              larger     image    Non-supercell tornadoes are circulations that form without a rotating updraft.   One non-supercell tornado is the  gustnado ,   a whirl of dust or debris at or near the ground with no condensation funnel,   which forms along the gust front of a storm. Another non-supercell tornado   is a  landspout .   A landspout is a tornado with a narrow, rope-like condensation funnel that   forms when the thunderstorm cloud is still growing and there is no rotating   updraft - the spinning motion originates near the ground. Waterspouts are similar   to landspouts, except   they occur over water. Damage from these types of tornadoes tends to be F2   or less.    » More About     VISUALIZING ROTATION      How do tornadoes form?         Scientists have learned a lot about tornadogenesis from theoretical         studies, field projects and physical models – but tornadogenesis – the       way tornadoes form – has vexed researchers for decades.        SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS          A rotating updraft is a key         to the development of a supercell, and eventually a tornado. There are         many ideas about how this rotation begins. One way a column of air can         begin to rotate is from wind  shear  – when         winds at two different levels above the ground blow at different speeds         or in different directions.          An example of wind shear that can eventually         create a tornado is when winds at ground level, often slowed down by         friction with the earth's surface, come from the southwest at 5 mph.         But higher up, at 5000 feet above the same location, the winds are blowing         from the southeast at 25 mph! An invisible ""tube"" of air begins to rotate         horizontally. Rising air within the thunderstorm tilts the rotating air         from horizontal to vertical – now the area of rotation extends through         much of the storm.          Once the updraft is rotating and being fed by warm, moist         air flowing in at ground level, a tornado can form. There are many ideas       about this too.          » More About SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS           We still have many questions. Scientists know from field studies that         perhaps as few as 20 percent of all supercell thunderstorms actually         produce tornadoes. Why does one supercell thunderstorm produce a tornado         and another nearby storm does not? What are some of the causes of winds         moving at different speeds or directions that create the rotation? What         are other circulation sources for tornadoes? What is the role of  downdrafts  (a sinking current of air) and the distribution of temperature and moisture         (both horizontally and vertically) in tornadogenesis? Scientists hope         to learn more about the processes that create wind shear and rotation,         tilt it vertically, and concentrate the rotation into a tornado when       they participate in a large field experiment in 2007.          And, since not all tornadoes come from supercells, what about tornadogenesis       in non-supercell thunderstorms?          NON-SUPERCELL TORNADOGENESIS          A non-supercell tornado         does not form from organized storm-scale rotation. These tornadoes form         from a vertically spinning parcel of air already occurring near the ground,         about 1-10 km in diameter, that is caused by wind shear from a warm,         cold, or sea breeze front, or a  dryline . When an updraft moves over the         spinning, and stretches it, a tornado can form. Eastern Colorado experiences         non-supercell tornadoes when cool air rushes down off the Rocky Mountains         and collides with the hot dry air of the plains. Since these types         of tornadoes happen mostly over scarcely populated land, scientists are       not sure how strong they are, but they tend to be small. Waterspouts       and gustnadoes are formed in this way too.                    HOW DOES NSSL CONTRIBUTE?            Tornadogenesis      NSSL scientists are working to understand the origins of tornadoes in thunderstorms       through the use of theory. The research focuses on understanding how the       local environment around the storm and internal processes within the storm       produce tornadoes. New insight into these processes can then be incorporated       into NSSL's warning decision technologies to help improve warnings for       tornadoes and severe storms.            Field Observations      NSSL scientists go into the field to look for specific processes in storms,       like observing how tornadoes form, and to test theories and hypotheses.            Storm modeling      Analysis of detailed data sets collected during storm intercept projects       provides invaluable knowledge of storm dynamics. This information helps       provide a coherent picture of storm structure that can be used in modeling       tornadoes and tornado features. The COMMAS model, co-developed by an NSSL       researcher can simulate a three-dimensional supercell thunderstorm.                next --  TORNADO     CLIMATOLOGY            11/15/06        "

Nature's Most Violent Storms   Adapted from:   A PREPAREDNESS GUIDE Including Safety Information   for Schools U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   National Weather Service September 1992 (NOAA, FEMA, The American Red Cross);    PDF version    Tornado!       Greg Stumpf     Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the world, these destructive forces   of nature are found most frequently in the United States east of the Rocky   Mountains during the spring and summer months. In an average year, 800 tornadoes   are reported nationwide, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A   tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm   to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction   with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile   wide and 50 miles long. Once a tornado in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas!     What causes tornadoes?   Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold   fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes.   Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong,   frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally,   large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.   During the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop   along a ""dryline,"" which separates very warm, moist air to   the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours.   Along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and   in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the   ground flows ""upslope"" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.   Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move   over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore.          Colorado Tornado (David Blanchard)           Dr. Joseph Golden (NOAA)      Tornado Variations       Some tornadoes may form during the early stages of rapidly developing thunderstorms.     This type of tornado is most common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains,   the Plains, and the Western States.     Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked   up.     Occasionally, two or more tornadoes may occur at the same time.     Waterspout       Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water.      Waterspouts are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states.     In the western United States, they occur with cold late fall or late winter   storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development.     Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes causing damage   and injuries.     How Do Tornadoes Form?                     Before thunderstorms develop, a change in wind direction and an increase         in wind speed with increasing height creates an invisible, horizontal         spinning effect in the lower atmosphere.                    Rising air within the thunderstorm updraft         tilts the rotating air from horizontal to vertical.                    An area of rotation, 2-6 miles wide, now extends through much of the         storm. Most strong and violent tornadoes form within this area of strong     rotation.                         Woodward OK (Ron Przybylinski)          A lower cloud base in the center of the photograph identifies an area         of rotation known as a rotating wall cloud. This area is often nearly rain-free.         Note rain in the background.                  Woodward OK (Ron Przybylinski)         Moments later a strong tornado develops in this area. Softball-size         hail and damaging ""straight-line"" winds also occurred with         this storm.                       Tornadoes Take Many Shapes and Sizes             Weak Tornadoes                   69% of all tornadoes           Less than 5% of tornado deaths           Lifetime 1-10+ minutes           Winds less than 110 mph                       Strong Tornadoes                   29% of all tornadoes           Nearly 30% of all tornado deaths           May last 20 minutes or longer           Winds 110-205 mph                        Violent Tornadoes                   Only 2% of all tornadoes            70% of all tornado deaths           Lifetime can exceed 1 hour           Lifetime can exceed 1 hour                           Tornado Myths:   MYTH:  Areas near rivers, lakes, and mountains are safe from tornadoes.      FACT:   No place is safe from tornadoes. In the late 1980's, a tornado swept through   Yellowstone National Park leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000   ft. mountain.   MYTH : The low pressure with a tornado causes buildings to ""explode""   as the tornado passes overhead.     FACT:  Violent winds and debris slamming into buildings cause most structural damage.   MYTH:  Windows should be opened before a tornado approaches   to equalize pressure and minimize damage.     FACT:  Opening windows allows damaging winds   to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone; instead, immediately go to a safe place.

The National Weather Service is strategically locating Doppler radars   across the country which can detect air movement toward or away from the radar.   Early detection of increasing rotation aloft within a thunderstorm can allow life-saving warnings to be issued before the tornado forms.        Doppler Radial Velocity             Jim Ladue     Frequency of Tornadoes   Tornadoes can occur at any time of the year.       In the southern states, peak tornado occurrence is in March through May,   while peak months in the northern states are during the summer.     Note, in some states, a secondary tornado maximum occurs in the fall.     Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 and 9 p.m. but have been known   to occur at all hours of the day or night.     The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have     been known to move in any direction. The average forward speed is 30 mph   but may vary from nearly stationary to 70 mph.     The total number of tornadoes is probably higher than indicated in the   western states. Sparce population reduces the number reported.

When conditions are favorable for severe weather to develop, a severe thunderstorm or tornado  WATCH  is issued   Weather Service personnel use information from weather radar, spotters,   and other sources to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado  WARNINGS  for areas where severe weather is imminent.   Severe thunderstorm warnings are passed to local radio and television stations   and are broadcast over local NOAA Weather Radio stations serving the warned   areas. These warnings are also relayed to local emergency management and public safety officials who can activate local warning systems to alert communities.     NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL   WEATHER SERVICE   The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings   and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios   sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography.   Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a   battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued.   What To Listen For...       TORNADO WATCH:  Tornadoes are possible in your area. Remain alert   for approaching storms.     TORNADO WARNING:  A tornado has been sighted or indicated by weather     radar. If a tornado warning is issued for your area and the sky becomes threatening,   move to your pre-designated place of safety.     SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH:  Severe thunderstorms are possible   in your area.     SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING:  Severe thunderstorms are occurring.       Remember, tornadoes occasionally develop in areas in which a severe thunderstorm   watch or warning is in effect. Remain alert to signs of an approaching tornado and seek shelter if threatening conditions exist.   Environmental Clues   Look out for:       Dark, often greenish sky     Wall cloud     Large hail     Loud roar; similar to a freight train       Caution:                     Some tornadoes appear as a visible funnel extending         only partially to the ground. Look for signs of debris below the visible         funnel.                        Alma, NE (Gene Rhoden)                  Some tornadoes are clearly visible while others are         obscured by rain or nearby low-hanging clouds.

Tornado Safety   What YOU Can Do   Before the Storm:       Develop a plan for you and your family for     home, work, school and when   outdoors.     Have frequent drills.     Know the county/parish in which you live, and keep a highway map nearby   to follow storm movement from weather bulletins.     Have a  NOAA Weather     Radio  with a warning alarm tone and battery back-up to receive   warnings.      Listen to radio and television for information.     If planning a trip outdoors, listen to the latest forecasts and take necessary   action if threatening weather is possible.         Top: James Campbell; Bottom: Gene Rhoden   If a Warning is issued or if threatening weather approaches:       In a home or building, move to a pre-designated shelter, such as a basement.     If an underground shelter is not available, move to an interior room or   hallway on the lowest floor and get under a sturdy piece of furniture.     Stay away from windows.     Get out of automobiles.     Do not try to outrun a tornado in your car; instead, leave it immediately.     Mobile homes, even if tied down, offer little protection from tornadoes   and should be abandoned.       Occasionally, tornadoes develop so rapidly that advance warning is not possible. Remain alert for signs of an approaching tornado. Flying debris   from tornadoes causes most deaths and injuries.   It's Up To YOU!   Each year, many people are killed or seriously injured by tornadoes despite   advance warning. Some did not hear the warning while others received the warning   but did not believe a tornado would actually affect them. The preparedness   information in this brochure, combined with timely severe weather watches and   warnings, could save your life in the event a tornado threatens your area.   After you have received the warning or observed threatening skies, YOU must   make the decision to seek shelter before the storm arrives.  It could be the most important decision you will ever make.     Who's Most At Risk?       People in automobiles     The elderly, very young, and the physically or mentally impaired     People in mobile homes     People who may not understand the warning due to a language barrier     Tornado Safety in Schools   EVERY School Should Have A Plan!         Develop a severe weather action plan and have frequent drills,     Each school should be inspected and tornado shelter areas designated by     a registered engineer or architect. Basements offer the best protection.     Schools without basements should use interior rooms and hallways on the lowest   floor and away from windows.     Those responsible for activating the plan should monitor weather information   from NOAA Weather Radio and local radio/television.     If the school's alarm system relies on electricity, have a compressed air   horn or megaphone to activate the alarm in case of power failure.     Make special provisions for disabled students and those in portable classrooms.     Make sure someone knows how to turn off electricity and gas in the event   the school is damaged.     Keep children at school beyond regular hours if threatening weather is     expected. Children are safer at school than in a bus or car. Students should   not be sent home early if severe weather is approaching.     Lunches or assemblies in large rooms should be delayed if severe weather     is anticipated. Gymnasiums, cafeterias, and auditoriums offer no protection   from tornado-strength winds.     Move students quickly into interior rooms or hallways on the lowest floor.   Have them assume the tornado protection position (shown at right).         Hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions should develop a similar plan         Paul Bowen   Your National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and American   Red Cross educate community officials and the public concerning the dangers   posed by tornadoes. YOU can prepare for the possibility of a tornado by learning   the safest places to seek shelter when at home, work, school, or outdoors.   You should also understand basic weather terms and danger signs related to   tornadoes. Your chances of staying safe during a tornado are greater if you   have a plan for you and your family, and practice the plan frequently.   FAMILY DISASTER PLAN     Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's   National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan.   Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere -   at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know   if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood   or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services - water, gas, electricity or telephones - were cut off?   Follow these basic steps to develop a family disaster plan...       I. Gather information about hazards.   Contact your local National     Weather Service office, emergency management or civil defense office, and     American Red Cross chapter. Find out what type of disasters could occur and     how you should respond. Learn your community's warning signals and evacuation   plans.     II. Meet with your family to create a plan.        Discuss the information     you have gathered. Pick two places to meet: a spot outside your home for     an emergency, such as fire, and a place away from your neighborhood in case     you can't return home. Choose an out-of-state friend as your ""family     check-in contact"" for everyone to call if the family gets separated.   Discuss what you would do if advised to evacuate.     III. Implement your plan      (1) Post emergency telephone numbers by phones;   (2) Install safety features in your house, such as smoke detectors and fire   extinguishers; (3) Inspect your home for potential hazards (such as items that   can move, fall, break, or catch fire) and correct them; (4) Have your family   learn basic safety measures, such as CPR and first aid; how to use a fire extinguisher;     and how and when to turn off water, gas, and electricity in your home; (5)   Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services   number; (6) Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your     needs for at least three days. Assemble a disaster supplies kit with     items you may need in case of an evacuation. Store these supplies in     sturdy, easy-to-carry containers, such as backpacks or duffle bags. Keep     important family documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller   disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car.               A DISASTER SUPPLIES     KIT SHOULD INCLUDE:      A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day)     and food that won't spoil  one change of clothing and footwear per person     one blanket or sleeping bag per person     a first-aid kit, including prescription medicines     emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a     portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries     an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash     special items for infant, elderly, or disabled family members.            IV. Practice and maintain       your plan .      Ask questions to make sure your family remembers meeting places, phone numbers,     and safety rules. Conduct drills. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change     the batteries at least once a year. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s)     according to manufacturer's instructions. Replace stored water and food every   six months.     LOCAL SPONSORSHIP:  NOAA/PA 92052 ARC 5002     Return to  nssl home   »  education   »  severe   weather safety       "

In an average year, 800           tornadoes are reported across the United States, resulting in           80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A tornado is as a violently           rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground.           The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction           with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess           of one mile wide and 50 miles long.             Tornadoes           come in all shapes and sizes and can occur anywhere in the U.S           at any time of the year. In the southern states, peak tornado           season is March through May, while peak months in the northern           states are during the summer.

Every one of the  United States has experienced at least one documented tornado, and many states are hit multiple times each year by a twister.  A tornado  may occur at any time of day, and on any day of the year.  It may hit in the middle of the night, or in the middle of winter.  However,  the most common timing for a tornado is in the late afternoon of warmer months.    Unfortunately, for most communities outside of Tornado Alley (in the central and Midwest US), a tornado is such a remote possibility,  that cities or towns may not have warning systems in place, and few people are prepared when a tornado does strike.  However, knowing  what to do in case of a tornado warning can save your life and the lives of your family.       [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |   Myths and Facts |  Safety: [     Preparation  |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |     Afterwards  ]        Tornado Myths and Facts    ""When confronted by a tornado warning, you should open all the windows in your house to equalize the  pressure.""   MYTH:   This just wastes valuable time.  Don't worry about equalizing the pressure, the roof ripping off and the pickup  truck smashing through the front wall will equalize the pressure for you.    ""I live in a big city, a tornado wouldn't hit a big city.""   MYTH:  Tornadoes have hit several large cities,  including Dallas, Oklahoma City, Wichita Falls, St. Louis, Miami, and Salt Lake City.  In fact, an urban tornado will have a lot more  debris to toss around than a rural twister.      A tornado approaches downtown Dallas, TX on 02 April, 1957    Click to visit NOAA library page   The path of the May 3, 1999 F5 tornado that tore through downtown Oklahoma City   From KFOR-TV, Oklahoma       ""Tornadoes don't happen in the mountains.""    MYTH:  Tornadoes do occur in the mountains. Damage from an F3 tornado  was documented above 10,000 feet, and a hiker in the mountains of Utah photographed a weak tornado in the mountains.     ""Tornadoes may occur in the middle of the night and even during the winter.""   FACT:   Although the likelihood is  lower at night and during colder months, tornadoes have caused death and destruction during these times of day and year.  Violent tornadoes,  while very unlikely during the winter months, do occasionally occur at night.  When severe weather is forecast, ensure your  NOAA weather radio is on and working properly before you go to bed.    ""My city doesn't get tornadoes because it is protected by a river.""    MYTH:  Many tornadoes have crossed rivers and  even gone on to cause widespread damage to riverside cities.  For example, the  Nachez, Mississippi tornado of 1840   tracked directly down the Mississippi River, killing hundreds, mostly on the water.  Others have crossed large rivers without losing speed (they  momentarily became water spouts) and devastated cities that folklore had thought immune to tornadoes. An example was the   Waco, TX tornado of 1953  that crossed the Brazos River, or the   Great St. Louis Cyclone of 1896  that jumped the Mississippi River.    ""Tornadoes have picked people and items up, carried them some distance and then set them down without injury or damage.""   FACT:  People and animals have been transported up to a quarter mile or more without serious injury.  Fragile items, such as sets of fine china, or glass-ware have  been blown from houses and recovered, miles away, without any damage.  However, given the quantity of airborne debris, these occurrences are the exception,  rather than the norm.    ""Hiding under a freeway overpass will protect me from a tornado.""    MYTH:  While the concrete and re-bar in the bridge may offer  some protection against flying debris, the overpass also acts as a wind tunnel and may actually serve to collect debris.  When you abandon your  vehicle at the overpass and climb up the sides, you are doing two things that are hazardous.  First, you are blocking the roadway with your vehicle.   When the tornado turns all the parked vehicles into a mangled, twisted ball and wedges them under the overpass, how will emergency vehicles get through?   Second, the winds in a tornado tend to be faster with height.  By climbing up off the ground, you place yourself in even greater danger from the tornado  and flying debris.  When coupled with the accelerated winds due to the wind tunnel (Venturi Effect), these winds can easily exceed 300 mph.   Unfortunately, at least three people hiding under underpasses during tornadoes have already been killed, and dozens have been injured by flying debris.  If you realize you won't be able to outrun an approaching tornado, you are much safer to abandon your vehicle, and take shelter in a road-side ditch  or other low spot (see  Tornado Safety ).  For more information on the use of highway overpasses for shelter, please see this   NWS discussion on highway overpasses .  Note:  If a highway overpass is your only  shelter option, only consider it if the overpass has sturdy roadway supports, next to which (at ground level) you can take shelter.   Avoid the smooth concrete, support-less spans at all costs.    ""I can outrun a tornado, especially in a vehicle.""   MYTH:  Tornadoes can move at up to 70 mph or more and shift directions  erratically and without warning.  It is unwise to try to outrace a tornado.  It is better to abandon your vehicle and seek shelter immediately.    ""While there is no such thing as a category 6 hurricane (the  Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale   only goes to category 5), there can be an F6 tornado.""   FACT:   The  Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale   actually goes up to F12!  The F12 level only begins at wind speeds exceeding Mach 1.0 (or around 738 mph at -3°C), so the  probability of a tornado having winds of this speed is infinitesimally small.  Could a tornado be an F6?  Yes, however, the Fujita  scale is based on wind speeds that are estimated from the damage the tornado produced (because no one has been able to stick an anemometer into  a tornado to measure the actual wind speeds).  Since the winds of an F5 tornado (up to 319 mph) are sufficient to completely destroy  just about everything in its path, an F6 really wouldn't do much more damage than that, and therefore could not be definitively labeled  as an F6.  When accurate measurements of wind speed inside an extreme tornado are eventually obtained, it is not impossible that they may exceed 319 mph.    ""Tornadoes are more likely to hit a mobile home park.""    MYTH:  Not so.  It just seems that way for two reasons.   First, mobile home parks are a ubiquitous part of our landscape.  There are tens of thousands of mobile homes in tornado alley, so there is a pretty  good likelihood that some of them will be in the path of a tornado.  Unfortunately, the second factor is that mobile homes offer little  to no protection against even the weakest tornadoes, so when a tornado does strike a mobile home park, the damage is more likely to be significant.   Winds that would only lift some shingles on a frame house can easily flip a mobile home.    ""Strong, sturdy brick or stone buildings will protect me from a tornado.""   MYTH:  While such buildings will provide more  protection in a tornado than a mobile home or timber frame structure, the winds of a tornado can easily launch a 2x4 through a brick wall, and can  cause even the sturdiest of buildings to experience roof or wall failure.      Remnants of a brick building after a tornado hit St. Louis, MO on 27 May, 1896   Click to visit NOAA Library Page      ""To keep from being sucked into the tornado, can tie myself to a well pipe, just like they did in the  movie ""Twister"".""   MYTH:    While it is unlikely that a tornado will dislodge a deeply buried pipe, the rope you tie around  yourself is more likely to act as a combination tetherball and cheese slicer.  Lighter winds will likely cause you to be whipped around  at the end of the rope, banging against anything within the radius of the rope. Stronger winds inside the tornado are just as likely to  pull your body from the rope (and possibly not in one piece).    ""A tornado can drive a straw through a telephone pole.""     FACT:  The forces inside a tornado are  incredible, and still poorly understood.  But they are certainly strong enough to turn otherwise harmless items into deadly missiles.      Anything can become a deadly projectile.    Click to visit NOAA Photo Library      ""A tornado is not coming directly at me, I am safe.""    MYTH:  Tornados have been known to act erratically,  often changing directions quickly.  Sturdy shelter is the only safe place to be during a tornado.  Although it may be tempting to  follow a tornado to get a cool photo, please leave the tornado chasing to trained meteorologists.          [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |    Myths and Facts  |  Safety: [      Preparation |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |     Afterwards  ]        Tornado Safety     Preparation     Get a NOAA Weather Radio.  While the local media (radio or television) are a great source of relaying NWS tornado watches and  warnings, they are only useful if you happen to have them turned on.  The NOAA weather radio is on standby all the time, and will sound  an alarm the moment a tornado watch or warning has been issued.  If you are expecting severe weather, turn up the volume so you can  clearly hear the alert (especially important if you are a sound sleeper).    Have a plan.  If a tornado warning is issued, or you spot a tornado heading for you, what will you do - if you are at  home, at work, in your vehicle.  Spend a moment to think about it and review it each spring. During imminent danger is not the time  to have to think up a plan.    If your home does not have a safe place that can be used as a tornado shelter (as is the case with mobile homes),  find out where in your neighborhood is recommended as a tornado shelter.  Most properly managed mobile home parks should  have a severe weather plan in place, and such a plan is useful for any neighborhood or subdivision.  At work, ask your employer  for a copy of their severe weather safety plan.  They should have a location where employees can seek shelter in the event  of a tornado or other severe weather.     Put together a tornado/severe weather kit.  At the least, the kit should include:     a battery powered radio (preferably with weather channels)     a flashlight in working order (do not store with batteries installed) - there are battery-less flashlights now available     immediate first aid needs (bandages, antibiotic wipes, tweezers, etc.)      food (energy bars) and bottle of water      emergency blanket (foil lined to retain warmth)     large marking pen or bottle of spray paint (to write your address on the driveway, remains of structures for rescue personnel)     copies of any critical medical records     whistle (to help rescuers locate you)     Place your tornado kit inside the place you have designated as your tornado shelter.    If you own a home with a concrete foundation, a water/fireproof safe, bolted to the house foundation, for storage of any irreplaceable  documents can be a good choice.  These documents should be in the safe at all times.  Do not wait until a tornado warning is issued before  trying to put things in the safe.    Practice a tornado drill at least once per year for your family, school, or workplace. Ensure everyone knows what to do without having  to think about it.

Seek shelter immediately.    A shelter should be someplace that has sturdy and/or reinforced walls, preferably  in the interior and underground (or lowest level) of a building.  In  tornado alley , many  homes and businesses have dedicated storm cellars or clearly identified tornado shelters with a sign similar to the following:         FEMA advocates the creation of a  Safe Room  for surviving  tornadoes or other disasters.  Unfortunately, the construction of such rooms, especially in older structures or mobile homes may be impractical or cost  prohibitive.  However, many rooms in existing structures are safer places than others.     No room is safe in a mobile home.  Evacuate the home and go to a designated storm shelter.   In a home or building with a designated storm shelter, go there immediately.   In a house or building with a basement, go to the basement.  Current guidance is to shelter in the northeast corner of the  basement.  If the basement has a small interior room (such as a bathroom or closet) this should be your shelter.   In a house or building with a slab foundation (no basement), seek shelter toward the middle of the structure, in a small  room (such as a bathroom or closet) on the lowest floor.  The stout walls and possible plumbing pipes in the walls may offer additional protection.      If you live or work with a vision or hearing impaired person, inform them of the tornado warning, and if necessary, guide them to shelter.  If you live or work with an otherwise physically disabled individual, recognize that they may need assistance to get to shelter.    If you are in charge of safety for many people (e.g., workplace, school, etc.), you should enact your tornado safety plan.  Such a plan involves getting everyone in the building to safety immediately.  If you are unsure how to develop such a plan, please visit the  following website for  developing a tornado safety plan .  Although designed for  schools, it will work for most workplaces.  Also, most modern fire alarm systems can be enhanced to sound a unique ""seek shelter"" alarm that  is distinctly different from a fire alarm.  Such alarms can save much time in alerting all building occupants of an approaching tornado.    When you are in shelter, assume a safety position.  In general, this should be on your knees, bent over with your head against a wall and  covered with your arms.  If you are restricted to a wheel chair or cannot otherwise assume the standard safety position, you should place  yourself in such a way that you are offered maximum protection from the structure around you.  Others sheltering with you should assist  you in getting into a safe position.      Accepted tornado safety position   Click to visit the tornado safety page of the Indiana Dept. of Education     Do not waste any time trying to save personal belongings or opening windows, at the moment of a tornado,  the only things that are irreplaceable are your life and the lives of those around you.

Hail and lightning also often accompany tornadoes.    If you have no time, or there are no sturdy structures nearby, find a low place in the landscape and lay down.  Do not shelter  under a highway overpass if it can be avoided.    If you are in a car, it is recommended that you abandon your vehicle to seek shelter.  You will generally be safer outside the vehicle than in it.    Wreckage of a car on I-40 in Oklahoma after a direct hit by an F5 tornado   From KFOR-TV News (03 May, 1999)    Stay as low as possible.  Not only do winds increase with height above the ground, but the more exposed your body is,  the more likely you will be struck by flying debris and seriously injured or killed.    Avoid sheltering by solitary objects or groups of trees. Lightning often occurs with tornadoes.           [ Top of Page  |  Overview  |    Myths and Facts  |  Safety: [     Preparation  |  Watches  |     Warnings  |  Outdoors  |    Afterwards ]        Afterwards     A tornado will usually pass very quickly and the whole ordeal, while seemingly endless, will be over within 5 or 10 minutes.   Now is the time to assess the situation.    Assess your injuries (if any).    If you are not trapped or seriously injured, see to those who sheltered with you.  Apply first aid if able.    Call for rescue help on a cell phone if able (it is likely that local land lines will be out of service).    If you are not trapped or seriously injured, help to look for anyone who may be.    If you are trapped, do not panic.  You may be in a dangerous situation, and panicked movements may cause further injury.   Call for help.  If you have a cell phone, it may still work.    If there are few visible reference points remaining above ground, attempt to mark existing landmarks with addresses  so rescue personnel can navigate and respond effectively.    When trained emergency responders arrive, comply with their directives.

In fact, tornadoes have been documented in every one of the United States, and on every continent, with the exception of Antarctica (even there, a tornado occurrence is not impossible).  In fact, wherever the atmospheric conditions are exactly right, the occurrence of a tornadic storm is possible.  More on the conditions necessary for tornado formation can be found at the   NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory Tornado Page .    However, some parts of the world are much more prone to tornadoes than others. Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis. This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer, subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries.  In addition, air in the mid-lattitudes often flows at different speeds and directions at different levels of the troposphere, facilitating the development of rotation within a storm cell.  Interestingly, the places that receive the most frequent tornadoes are also considered the most fertile agricultural zones of the world.  This is due in part to the high number of convective storms delivering needed precipitation to these areas.  Simply as a result of the large number of convective storms and the favorable environment, the odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes.    In terms of absolute tornado counts, the United States leads the list, with an average of over 1,000 tornadoes recorded each year.  A distant second is Canada, with around 100 per year.  Other locations that experience frequent tornado occurrences include northern Europe, western Asia, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, China, South Africa and Argentina.  In fact, the United Kingdom has more tornadoes, relative to its land area, than any other country.  Fortunately, most UK tornadoes are relatively weak. [ Encyclopaedia Britannica Article ]    Regions of the world with increased likelihood of experiencing tornadoes.    Larger Map          top of the page        Tornado Alley    In the United States, there are two regions with a disproportionately high frequency of tornadoes.  Florida is one and ""Tornado Alley"" in the south-central U.S. is the other.  Florida has numerous tornadoes simply due to the high frequency of almost daily thunderstorms.  In addition, several tropical storms or hurricanes often impact the Florida peninsula each year.  When these tropical systems move ashore, the embedded convective storms in the rain bands often produce tornadoes.  However, despite the violent nature of a tropical storm or hurricane, the tornadoes they spawn (some as water spouts) tend to be weaker than those produced by non-tropical thunderstorms.    Tornado Alley is a nickname given to an area in the southern plains of the central U.S. that consistently experiences a high frequency of tornadoes each year.  Tornadoes in this region typically happen in late Spring and occasionally the early fall.  The Gulf Coast area has a separate tornado maximum nicknamed ""Dixie Alley"" with a relatively high frequency of tornadoes occurring in the late fall (October through December).     Strong to violent tornadoes (those of EF3 or stronger on the  Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale ), are relatively rare, and do not typically occur outside the United States.  Although the boundaries of Tornado Alley are debatable (depending on which criteria you use - frequency, intensity, or events per unit area), the region from central Texas, northward to northern Iowa, and from central Kansas and Nebraska east to western Ohio is often collectively known as Tornado Alley.  Meteorologically, the region known as Tornado Alley is ideally situated for the formation of supercell thunderstorms,often the producers of violent (EF2 or greater) tornadoes.    Overall, most tornadoes (around 77%) in the U.S. are considered weak (EF0 or EF1) and about 95% of all U.S. tornadoes are below EF3 intensity.  The remaining small percentage of tornadoes are categorized as violent (EF3 and above).  Of these violent twisters, only a few (0.1% of all tornadoes) acheive EF5 status, with estimated winds over 200 mph and nearly complete destruction.  However, given that on average over 1000 tornadoes hit the U.S. each year, that means that 20 can be expected to be violent and possibly one might be incredible (EF5).         U.S. Tornado Frequency and Tornado Alley        Click for larger image of Tornado Alley  From  Concannon et al, 2000        Click for larger image of Dixie Alley       Note: Tornado Alley has no agreed upon boundaries, these are just two representations based  upon different criteria.        top of the page      Timing    Because most tornadoes are related to the strength of a thunderstorm, and thunderstorms normally gain most of their energy from solar heating and latent heat released by the condensation of water vapor, it is not surprising that most tornadoes occur in the afternoon and evening hours, with a minimum frequency around dawn (when temperatures are lowest and radiation deficits are highest).  However, tornadoes have occurred at all hours of the day, and nighttime occurrences may give sleeping residents of a community little or no warning.      Tornado Occurrence by hour of day for the St. Louis Weather Forecast Office County Warning Area        In addition, tornadoes occur throughout the year.  Because a tornado may occur at any time of the day or year somewhere in the U.S., there really is no national tornado ""season"" (as there is with Atlantic hurricanes).  Instead, each region may experience increased tornadic potential at different times of the year.  Like with the diurnal pattern, for the United States (and hemisphere) as a whole, the months in which tornadoes are most likely correspond to the times of year with increased solar heating and strong frontal systems.  Regionally, the frequency of tornadoes in the United States is closely tied with the progression of the warm season when warm and cold air masses often clash.  Most of the early spring tornadoes in the U.S. tend to occur in the Southeast and South Central regions.  Gulf States, such as Mississippi and Louisiana are the frequent recipients of tornadoes from February to April.  Late spring tornadoes generally spread a bit farther north, often into Kansas, Nebraska and the Tennessee Valley region.  By mid-summer, most of Tornado Alley is active and tornadoes may occur throughout the U.S.  Late summer tends to bring some of the stronger tornadoes into the upper Midwest and Ohio valleys, and the pattern shifts back southward into the late autumn.  The fewest tornadoes are documented during the winter months.  Although rare, deadly winter outbreaks do occur.      Average tornado frequency by month of year 2003-2005          top of the page        Historical Records and Trends      Oldest Known Photograph of a Tornado (1884)     Click to visit NOAA Photo Library Page     One of the main difficulties with tornado records is that a tornado, or evidence of a tornado must have been observed.  Unlike rainfall or temperature, which may be measured by a fixed instrument, tornadoes are ephemeral and very unpredictable.  If a tornado occurs in a place with few or no people, it is not likely to be documented.  Unfortunately, much of what we know as tornado alley was very sparsely populated until the 20th century, and so it is possible that many significant tornadoes may never have made it into the historical record.    Much early work on tornado climatology in the U.S. was done by John Park Finley in his book  Tornadoes , published in 1887.  While some of Finley's safety guidelines have since been refuted as dangerous practices, the book itself remains a seminal work in tornado research.  The University of Oklahoma has created a pdf copy of the entire book and made it accessible at:  John Finley's 'Tornadoes'    Today, nearly all of the United States is reasonably well populated, or at least covered by NOAA's Doppler weather radars.  Even if a tornado is not actually observed, modern damage assessments by NWS personnel can discern if a tornado caused the damage, and if so, how strong the tornado may have been.  This disparity between tornado records of the past and current records contributes a great deal of uncertainty regarding questions about the long-term behavior or patterns of tornado occurrence.  In addition, even today many smaller tornadoes still may go undocumented in places with low populations or inconsistent communication facilities.     With increased national doppler radar coverage, increasing population, and greater attention to tornado reporting, there has been an increase in the number of tornado reports over the past several decades.  This can create a misleading appearance of an increasing trend in tornado frequency.  To better understand the true variability and trend in tornado frequency in the US, the total number of strong to violent tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 category on the Enhanced Fujita scale) can be analyzed.  These are the tornadoes that would have likely been reported even during the decades before Dopplar radar use became widespread and practices resulted in increasing tornado reports.  The bar chart below indicates there has been little trend in the frequency of the strongest tornadoes over the past 55 years.

Also, as a result of improved forecasting and early warning systems, the death toll from tornadoes has dropped significantly over the years, despite increasing populations in tornado-prone areas.  Unfortunately, super-violent tornadoes are still documented, some with exceptional death tolls.  Interestingly, a number of these devastating tornadoes have occurred outside of Tornado Alley, and several at times of day or year not normally associated with violent tornadoes.  Although all of most deadly tornadoes occurred prior to the invention of the Fujita Scale, historical records of their damage have led them to be classified as either F4 or F5.

The National Weather Service (NWS) defines a Tornado as a violently rotating column of air in contact with the earth surface (land or water) and commonly associated with a severe thunderstorm.   A tornado generally occurs when high winds within a low pressure system (such as a thunderstorm) cause water vapor in the air to condense in to a condensation funnel cloud.  Many less severe tornadoes are not even visible to the human eye.  Major tornadoes usually become more visible when the strong winds within the funnel lift up dirt and debris off the Earth surface.  Tornadoes are generally classified as either a land spout (a tornado on land), a water spout (a tornado that forms over water) or a gustnado (a small tornado caused by a strong downburst of wind from a thunderstorm).   The average tornado has maximum wind speeds of about 112 mph or less, measures around 250 feet in width and travels approximately one mile before falling apart.  Some of the most catastrophic tornadoes in recorded history have had winds in excess of 300 miles an hour (twice that of a category 5 hurricane), have measured more than 2 miles in girth, and have carved devastating paths of destruction miles and miles in length.
