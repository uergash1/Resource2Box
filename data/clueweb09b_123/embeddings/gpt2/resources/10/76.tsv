GX033-37-4678566	Testimony of   International Council of Cruise Lines   Before the   House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation         October 7, 1999         Cynthia A. Colenda, President  International Council of Cruise Lines  1211 Connecticut Avenue, NW  Washington, D.C.  20036  Tel: 202-296-8463     INTRODUCTION  On behalf of the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL), we are pleased to appear before the Subcommittee to discuss industry progress on several areas of interest to the Subcommittee.   ICCL is a non-profit trade association that represents the interests of 17 of the largest cruise lines operating in international and domestic markets.  ICCL member cruise lines serve major ports in the United States and call on more than 300 ports around the world.  Last year, ICCL’s cruise vessel operators carried more than 5 million passengers on 95 vessels.  Our passenger vessels represent approximately 90% of the North American cruise capacity and over 50% of the worldwide passenger cruise capacity.  The ICCL membership also includes over 60 Associate Member companies a significant number of which are U.S. based companies that provide a wide variety of services and products to support the industry’s operations worldwide.  The Committee has requested that ICCL address five major issue areas in our testimony: the industry’s impact on national and state economies; the overall safety record of the industry; passenger vessel policies and practices in the environmental area; the ICCL guidelines on medical facilities that deal with the staffing, equipment, and procedures utilized onboard passenger vessels; and the ICCL policy statement regarding the reporting of onboard crime.   ECONOMIC IMPACT  The cruise industry and its nationwide network of U.S. business partners provide significant economic benefits and jobs throughout the country.  The total economic impact of the cruise lines, their passengers, and their U.S. suppliers reached $ll.6 billion in l997, according to a recently updated study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates (WEFA).  These significant industry expenditures were responsible for generating over l76,000 jobs for U.S. citizens. The cruise industry has plans to build 47 new vessels over the next three years, as a result, industry expenditures are projected to reach $l8.3 billion by 2002.  These additional expenditures will provide expanded growth and business opportunities for U.S. industries and employees who provide services and support our industry operations worldwide.   Another industry study was also conducted this year by PwC that identified the state-by-state impact of cruise industry purchases.  The study concluded that the direct spending of the cruise industry and its passengers just on U.S. goods and services was $7 billion in l997 and extended to all 50 States.  Cruise industry operations depend on the vital support of many U.S. business and service sector suppliers. The top industries benefiting from the cruise industry are manufacturing; finance, insurance and real estate; and transportation, communications and utilities.  We have provided a more complete listing of cruise industry expenditures by state and by industry in the Appendices.  The cruise industry is proud of the economic partnerships we have developed with other U.S. industries across the country. While ICCL member vessels spend most of their time at sea, our member lines are responsible for stimulating business activity not only in U.S. coastal states but also in other regions of the country. Industry purchases range from California, Illinois and Texas, to Kansas, Minnesota and New York.  An example of direct cruise industry spending in ten selected States are outlined below:   Alaska      $363.3M   California     $738.9M   Illinois      $112.1M   Maryland       $66.9M   Minnesota       $43.6M   North Carolina    $134.4M   New Jersey     $153.7M   New York     $723.8M   Oregon        $99.7M   Pennsylvania     $121.6M   Texas      $123.1M   Washington     $162.9M     Of course, the most important component of this industry is our passengers.  Today, the typical cruise passenger is from middle America and comes from every state and age bracket.  The continued success of the cruise industry is in large part attributable to the fact that a cruise vacation is affordable for the average American.  The following provides a selected state listing of passengers who cruised in l998:   Alaska       4,969   California  725,581   Illinois   169,447   Maryland    74,881   Minnesota    81,892   North Carolina 106,459   New Jersey  176,812   New York  404,023   Oregon     40,818   Pennsylvania  192,689   Texas   199,068   Washington    83,682   SAFETY  The cruise industry’s highest priority is to protect the safety of our passengers and crew.  Beginning at the vessel design stage, safety is built into every aspect of a cruise ship.  Our industry’s commitment to safety is demonstrated by our excellent safety record.  In l996, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted a comprehensive cruise ship safety study which concluded that our industry was one of the safest modes of transportation available and that international safety initiatives coming into force would further improve our safety record.  As reported by this Task Force, SOLAS requirements “are now significantly more stringent than U.S. regulations.”  In fact over the past decade, an estimated 44 million passengers enjoyed a cruise vacation.  During this period, not one passenger death due to a marine incident was reported on any of our vessels operating from a U.S. port.  This enviable safety record is the direct result of the important focus that we place in this area.  Of course, our industry cannot be complacent, we are always looking for ways to improve our performance.   ICCL and its member lines actively participate in the development of new IMO safety initiatives that govern the operation of cruise vessels worldwide.  Over the past several years, IMO has adopted several new international regulations that significantly enhance passenger vessel safety.  These comprehensive IMO regulations established stringent new standards that require significant fire safety upgrades for new and existing vessels; adopt advanced crew safety training requirements; and require all vessels to implement a specified safety management system that delineates crew responsibilities and establishes mandatory codes of practice.  These internationally mandated standards – treaties adopted by the United States government – are closely monitored by both flag state and port state authorities.   To assure compliance with safety regulations, the U.S. Coast Guard exercises port state control authority over foreign flag cruise ships operating from U.S. ports.  The Coast Guard examines each cruise ship quarterly for structure and operation of onboard safety equipment and emergency procedures under the Control Verification Program to ensure compliance with the Safety of Life at Seas (SOLAS) Convention.   ICCL has a successful, formalized partnership with the Coast Guard. The partnership group meets on a regular basis both at the executive and technical levels to discuss emerging safety issues and recent passenger vessel initiatives adopted or under consideration at the IMO.  The partnership has discussed coordination of joint emergency preparedness exercises to ensure the effectiveness of response capabilities, has worked on methods to identify lessons learned from past marine casualties, and has instituted crew training policies in response to STCW. We believe that this partnership is a very productive way to exchange information on the operational impacts of proposed policies as well as identification of resources required to respond to various types of vessel emergencies.  We appreciate the guidance and leadership that the Coast Guard has provided to the industry, and we are very pleased to participate in this valuable partnership.   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  The cruise industry is committed to protecting the environment and to keeping our oceans clean.  Our industry has a strong environmental record and will continue to strengthen our onboard environmental programs through enhanced technologies and improved policies and practices.  Regrettably, there have been violations of environmental laws involving cruise lines in the past few years.  These incidents have served as an important wake-up call, and caused our industry to redouble its efforts to improve its environmental performance.  These incidents demonstrate, however, that the international cruise industry is strictly accountable to U.S. environmental enforcement agencies and subject to severe penalties whenever violations occur.   The importance our industry places on environmental matters is demonstrated by the recent adoption and ratification of an ICCL Policy on the Handling and Disposal of Waste Materials Onboard Cruise Vessels.  This policy strengthens the industry’s current practices and reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of the maritime environment.  This ICCL action enhances our policies and practices in the following major areas:  1. Design, construct and operate vessels with state-of-the-art equipment to minimize impact on the environment;  2. Develop improved technologies to exceed current requirements for protection of the environment;  3. Implement a policy goal of zero discharge of MARPOL, Annex V solid waste products by use of more comprehensive waste minimization procedures to significantly reduce shipboard generated waste;  4. Expand waste reduction strategies to include reuse and recycling to the maximum extent possible so as to land ashore even smaller quantities of waste products;  5. Improve processes and procedures for collection and transfer of hazardous waste; and  6. Strengthen comprehensive programs for monitoring and auditing of onboard environmental practices and procedures in accordance with the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code).   The passenger vessel industry is highly regulated and operates within a comprehensive scheme of international and domestic environmental laws.  The vessel owners, the flag state, the classification societies, and port state authorities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, each play an important role in enforcing these stringent requirements.   The environmental regulations which most significantly impact the cruise vessel industry are found in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annexes I and V.  MARPOL sets strict standards for all commercial vessels, including passenger vessels, to prevent ship-generated pollution from oil, garbage, and waste.  International law further regulates water discharge, air emissions, onboard solid waste management, and recycling.  This Convention has been ratified by some 90 nations, including the United States and most other maritime nations of the world.   Another important IMO Convention that will further enhance the cruise industry’s strong record of safety and environmental protection is the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code).  This stringent new regulation incorporates many of the proven concepts of quality management to provide for the prevention of accidents, casualties and damage to the environment.  The ISM Code specifically requires all vessels and vessel operators to establish a comprehensive program of safety management record keeping, conduct rigorous internal safety and environmental audits, and requires external audits by experienced technical experts.   In addition, the cruise industry is also required to comply with several U.S. environmental laws when operating within U.S. waters.  These include the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act of l990, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act among others.  The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead agency for enforcement of these statutes that impose stringent requirements for oil pollution and waste discharged by vessels registered in any nation.   The cruise industry has a vested interest in protecting the beauty of the oceans where our vessels sail.  We will continue to strengthen our onboard environmental programs through enhanced technology and improved policies and practices.  MEDICAL FACILITIES  The cruise industry has taken a proactive role in addressing the provision of shipboard medical care.  The industry is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy experience for both our passengers and crew.  Over four years ago, the members of ICCL began work on development of industry-wide guidelines for the facilities, staffing, equipment and procedures utilized aboard passenger vessels.  In l996, ICCL issued Medical Facilities Guidelines that represented the work of a group of experienced medical physicians and other medical experts knowledgeable about the unique needs and limitations of shipboard medical care.  During this effort, ICCL worked in conjunction with the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the national association representing over 20,000 practicing emergency and other physicians in the U.S. and abroad.  ACEP’s Section of Cruise Ship and Maritime Medicine is specifically dedicated to training, education and research in the advancement of shipboard medical care.  The ICCL Medical Facilities Guidelines are generally intended to foster the following goals:  ? To provide reasonable emergency medical care for passengers and crew aboard cruise vessels.  ? To stabilize patients and/or initiate reasonable diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.  ? To facilitate the evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients when deemed necessary by a shipboard physician.  Both ICCL and the cruise industry have continued their interest in promoting appropriate shipboard medical facilities.  Each year, ICCL medical facilities experts meet with the ACEP Cruise Ship Medicine Section to discuss new developments, as well as to update both organization’s published guidelines in this area.   Our next annual meeting is scheduled on October l4th.      PASSENGER SECURITY   The cruise industry takes any and all cases of reported crimes onboard our ships seriously.  The safety and security of our passengers and crew is our highest priority. With more than five million passengers cruising each year, the industry takes every precaution to ensure that our passengers are safe and that they have a fun and enjoyable vacation experience.  In fact, we have the highest customer satisfaction rating of any vacation option.   A cruise ship is inherently secure because it is a controlled environment with limited access.  Every person onboard a cruise ship, from the captain to the cleaning staff and all guests, are placed on an official manifest.  Passengers and crew may embark or disembark only after passing through security.  Once the ship is underway, access is strictly limited to documented employees and fare-paying passengers.  Cruise lines operate within a very strict legal framework that gives both federal and state authorities the right to investigate crimes onboard cruise ships. Unlike most instances of shoreside crime, the FBI has the authority to investigate alleged crimes in international waters when an American is involved.  Incidents of criminal conduct are extremely low in comparison to similar incidents reported ashore.  FBI and U.S. Census Bureau statistics indicate that the number of reported shoreside incidents are at least 20 times greater than the number of reported shipboard assaults.  However, our companies have not relied on these favorable statistics.  In July, ICCL executives adopted an industry-wide standard for dealing with the investigation and reporting of crimes committed onboard cruise ships.  This statement of zero tolerance for any crime committed onboard our vessels requires the reporting of all serious crimes involving U.S. citizens to the FBI for further investigation.  Cruising is one of the most popular vacation options, in large part, because of its excellent safety record and the high level of quality service provided onboard our ships.  The cruise industry is committed to providing a secure environment for its passengers and crew.  We will continue to work with all appropriate federal and state agencies to ensure the safety and well being of all passengers and crew onboard our vessels.  ICCL and its member lines have taken proactive steps to address significant industry issues through the development of industry-wide policies.  We maintain our commitment to operate in a responsible manner and intend to demonstrate this commitment through the continued development of new industry policies and guidelines.  As national and international issues arise, our industry has been and will continue to be aggressive in addressing them.  Thank you Mr. Chairman
GX250-00-3624264	"﻿                                                                                                                                                                                            National Alert                 A Warning About Continuing Patterns of Metallic Mercury        Exposure Metallic mercury is a hazardous chemical that can        cause serious health problems. Children (especially very young children)        and fetuses are most vulnerable. The Agency for Toxic Substances and        Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the         Environmental        Protection Agency (EPA)  are jointly issuing an alert to the general        public. There is a continuing pattern of metallic mercury exposure in        children and teenagers and in persons using certain folk medicines or        participating in certain ethnic or religious practices. It is        important for the general public to understand that either short-term or        long-term exposures to metallic mercury can lead to serious health        problems. Human exposure to metallic mercury occurs primarily from        breathing contaminated air. Other forms of mercury can be absorbed by        drinking contaminated water, eating food (usually fish containing        mercury), and from skin contact. At high levels, metallic mercury can        cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus. Other forms        of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury        can cause health problems.  Metallic mercury exposure can cause harm        before symptoms arise.  Once released into the environment, mercury is        very hard to clear up. If it is left unattended where exposures can occur,        it can have dangerous effects on human health.         Incidents involving schoolchildren In recent years, increasing        numbers of metallic mercury spills and contamination involving        schoolchildren have been reported:  In August 1994, more than 500        students in Belle Glade, Florida, were contaminated with metallic mercury        after three children found 4 jars (totalling 55 pounds) of        metallic-mercury in an abandoned van. The local hazardous waste materials        team decontaminated the children (removed contaminated clothing and washed        the metallic mercury from their skin). More than 20 families had to be        evacuated while their homes were decontaminated.  In November 1994,        college students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida,        removed metallic mercury from one of the school's laboratories. Students        living in the dormitory were evacuated and housed in a local hotel while        the dormitory was decontaminated.  In June 1996, metallic mercury        was taken from a middle school in St. Joseph, Missouri, and used in and        outside of school by a group of teenagers. Approximately 200 children were        tested for mercury exposure; one child was hospitalized and another five        underwent outpatient treatment to remove the mercury from their systems;        20 other children had mildly elevated mercury levels. Two homes and a car        required extensive decontamination.  In October 1996, a high school        in Oskaloosa, Kansas and a convalescent home in Johnson County, Kansas,        were contaminated with metallic mercury; 52 students and an unknown number        of residents of the home were tested. On the basis of ATSDR        recommendations, the school was closed for a week until indoor air levels        were safe. A month later, sampling at the school identified an increase in        air mercury concentrations. The school was re-evaluated and additional        clean-up was done as recommended by ATSDR.  In November 1996, ATSDR        again assisted state health officials and EPA in evaluating contamination        at a high school and a home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, near Wilkes-Barre.        Four areas in the school had levels of metallic mercury contamination that        required cleanup.  In March 1997, a middle school student on his        way to school found metallic mercury on the street in front of his home in        Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The student took the metallic mercury to        school and shared it with three to four classmates. Also, in March 1997 a        broken mercury thermometer was discovered after school on the floor of a        bathroom stall in the boys bathroom. One thermometer was confirmed missing        from the science department's inventory. The school was found to be clear        of contamination with the exception of one science laboratory and the        carpet in a classroom. Two homes required decontamination.         Schoolteachers, particularly science teachers, and        administrators need to be aware of students' interest in mercury,        especially metallic mercury, and take steps to ensure that children are        aware of its dangers and that any mercury kept in school is safely and        securely contained.          Incidents involving religious practices Persons who use metallic        mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices are at risk.        Metallic mercury is sold under the name  ""azogue""  in stores        (sometimes called botanicas), which specialize in religious items used in        Esperitismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico), Santeria (a        Cuban-based religion that venerates both African deities and Catholic        saints), and voodoo.  The use of azogue in religious practices is        recommended in some Hispanic communities by family members, spiritualists,        card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carried on one's person        in a sealed pouch prepared by a spiritual leader or sprinkled in the home        or automobile. Some botanica owners suggest mixing it in bath water or        perfume and placing it in devotional candles.         General facts The following are general facts about metallic        mercury and its risks, as well as information about how people can protect        themselves from exposure and resulting health effects.         What is mercury and how is it used? Mercury occurs naturally in        the environment in several forms. Metallic Mercury is the liquid form used        in thermometers. Mercury is also used in other common consumer products        such as fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, medical equipment such as        blood pressure measurement instruments, and mercury switches in children's        sneakers that light up. This alert concentrates on metallic mercury, but        hazards are also associated with other types. Of these, the most common is        methyl mercury contamination of fish.         How could I be exposed to mercury? In the previously described        school-associated cases, children were unaware of the dangers involved in        exposing themselves and their families to this deadly poison. Adults are        also often unaware of the hazards associated with mercury; some have even        brought it home from work for children to play with. Just one-half        teaspoon of mercury spilled in the home can be dangerous.  Adults        using certain folk medicines or participating in certain religious or        ethnic practices may also expose themselves and their families to metallic        mercury's effects. Because metallic mercury vaporizes into the air at room        temperatures, it presents an immediate health risk to anyone spending a        significant amount of time in a room where metallic mercury is sprinkled        or spilled onto the floor, or where opened containers of metallic mercury        are present. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few        drops) can raise air concentrations to levels that may be harmful to        health.         How does mercury affect health? At high levels, metallic mercury        can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus. Other        forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic        mercury can cause health problems. Mercury exposure can begin to cause        harm before symptoms arise. Once symptoms do arise, health problems        related to metallic mercury poisoning can include tremors, changes in        vision or hearing, insomnia, weakness, difficulty with memory, headache,        irritability, shyness and nervousness, and a health condition called        acrodynia.  Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially        vulnerable to the toxic effects of metallic mercury because it readily        passes from the placenta to the fetus. Mercury may accumulate in higher        concentrations in the unborn baby than in the mother. Young children, who        often play on the floor where metallic mercury may have been spilled, are        particularly at risk for effects on the central nervous system. Mercury        vapors are readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the lungs, and the        human central nervous system, which is still developing during the first        few years of life, may become damaged.  Health effects can result        from short-term or long-term exposure. The body gets rid of mercury        through the urine and feces. Removal of this substance from the body can        take up to several months after exposure. Acrodynia is characterized by        itching, swelling, and flushing; pink-colored palms and soles of the feet;        excessive perspiration; rashes; irritability; fretfulness; sleeplessness;        joint pains and weakness. Children exposed to metallic mercury for long        periods may have trouble learning in school. When mercury levels in the        body are extremely high, ""chelation"" therapy is necessary. Chelation        therapy involves putting a chemical into the bloodstream; the chemical        combines with the mercury to aid in its removal from the body.         Prevention is the key to avoiding poisoning in homes,        schools, and families.          What is mercury contamination and how can I prevent it? First,        avoid using metallic mercury. Appropriate substitutes are available for        nearly all uses of metallic mercury. Therefore, be sure you need to use        it. If not, make arrangements to safely dispose of whatever metallic        mercury you might have. If you do need to use metallic mercury, make sure        it is safely stored in a leakproof container. Keep it in a secure space        (e.g., a locking closet) so that others cannot easily get it. Use of        metallic mercury in a controlled environment helps to reduce the risk that        contamination will occur.  Mercury contamination results from        exposure through the air, water, food, soil, or direct contact. Exposure        to metallic mercury occurs when it is not stored in a closed container.        Contamination may include the spilling of metallic mercury on clothes,        furniture, carpet, floors, walls, the natural environment, and even the        human body. Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to        remove from such items as clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, and walls.        The vapors will also accumulate in walls and other structures in        contaminated rooms. The contamination can remain for months or years,        posing a risk to exposed individuals. The use of metallic mercury in a        home or apartment not only poses a threat to persons currently residing in        that structure, but also to those who subsequently occupy that dwelling        and are unaware of the past mercury use.         Can I clean up mercury with a vacuum cleaner? Never use a vacuum        cleaner. Using a vacuum cleaner causes metallic mercury to vaporize in the        air, creating greater health risks. It also ruins the vacuum cleaner.         Can electronic equipment collect mercury vapors? Metallic mercury        vapors can accumulate in electronic equipment, especially computers. When        the computer is turned on, the mercury revaporizes. This cycle of metallic        mercury collecting and vaporizing from computers has been seen in several        incidents in schools.         What should I do to keep my home safe? Metallic mercury is used in        a variety of household and industrial items including thermostats,        fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood        pressure machines. Care must be taken in handling and disposing of all        items in the home that contain metallic mercury.  First,  do        NOT  try to vacuum or heat the metallic mercury in any way. Mercury        vapors are very dangerous and are virtually undetectable. Avoid breathing        mercury dust, vapor, mist, or gas. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and        clothing. If you feel you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury,        wash thoroughly after handling. Remove contaminated clothing and wash        before reuse. Provide as much clean air as possible.  For example,        if a thermometer breaks, remove children from the area. Clean up the bead        of metallic mercury by carefully rolling it onto a sheet of paper or        sucking it up with an eye dropper. After picking up the metallic mercury,        put it into a bag or airtight container. The paper or eye dropper should        also be bagged and disposed of properly according to guidance provided by        environmental officials or your local health department. Try to ventilate        the room to the outside and close off from the rest of the home. Use fans        for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If larger amounts of        metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar), make sure that the        metallic mercury is in an airtight container and call your local health        department for instructions in how to safely dispose of it. If the larger        amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department        and fire authorities.  Do not simply throw it away, but instead seek        professional guidance.

How and where to review written information and comments: The record for this notice has been established under docket number W-00-17 (Cruise Ships), and includes supporting documentation as well as printed versions of electronic correspondence. The record is available for inspection from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays, at the Water Docket, EB 57, USEPA Headquarters, 401 M. St., SW., Washington, DC. For access to docket materials, please call 202-260-3027.     Background: On March 17, 2000, EPA received a petition asking that EPA undertake an ``assessment of the volumes and characteristics of the spectrum of waste streams from cruise ships, analysis of their potential impact on water quality, the marine environment, and human health.'' In response to that petition, we are assessing whether discharges from cruise ships currently pose a risk to the environment. EPA is working with the Coast Guard and other Federal agencies on this assessment.     The discharges of particular interest from cruise ships are gray water (wastewater from baths, sinks and galleys), black water (wastewater from toilets), oily bilge water, solid waste (e.g., food waste, paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, metal, glass) and wastes from equipment operations, hotel and restaurant services, photo labs, dry- cleaning, and paints.     Specific information that we are requesting for wastewater, solid waste, and hazardous materials includes:     (1) Quantities and properties;     (2) Methods of discharge or disposal;     (3) Locations of discharge or disposal, such as outside of State waters, 10 miles from port, or in-port waste receptacles;     (4) Environmental impacts; and     (5) Existing regulatory or voluntary controls.     As we consider the range of environmental issues concerning these cruise ship discharges, we are also interested in learning about voluntary environmental management programs and standards used by various cruise ships. We are interested in hearing about new and alternative approaches being proposed or used by the cruise ship industry or by public-private partnerships. These approaches may include: environmental management systems based on ISO 14000 and/or the International Safety Management (ISM) System Code; environmental certification programs developed by Ship Classification Societies; and local or regional Memoranda of Understanding or other agreements between the industry, government, and other stakeholders. We are interested in a comprehensive picture of how various pollution prevention programs are currently being used and how these efforts might be advanced to protect the marine environment. In addition, we are soliciting comments on whether we should consider changes to existing controls or regulations or add new regulations for control of these discharges in order to more adequately protect the environment from the effects of these discharges.     We are not attempting to collect information or comment on air emissions from cruise ships, or on possible impacts of cruise ships other than from their waste management or discharge practices, at these public information hearings.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes regulations regarding sewage and graywater discharges from certain cruise vessels transiting applicable waters of Alaska. Operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and transiting applicable waters of Alaska are restricted in where they may discharge effluents and would be required to perform testing of sewage and graywater discharges and maintain records of such discharges. The Coast Guard would inspect, monitor, and oversee this process to ensure compliance with applicable water quality laws and regulations.  DATES: Comments and related material must reach the Coast Guard on or before May 25, 2001.  ADDRESSES: You may mail comments and related material to the Commander Seventeenth Coast Guard District (m), P.O. Box 25517, Juneau, AK, 99802-5517, or deliver them to room 751 of the Federal Building in Juneau, AK between 9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is 907-463-2802. You must also mail comments on collection of information to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer, U.S. Coast Guard.     The Coast Guard Seventeenth District (m) Secretary maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments and material received from the public, as well as documents indicated in this preamble as being available in the docket, will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 751, U.S. Coast Guard Seventeenth District (m), between 9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Spencer Wood, Seventeenth District (moc), 907-463-2809.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Request for Comments      We encourage you to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments and related material. If you do so, please include your name and address, identify the docket number for this rulemaking (CGD17-01- 003), indicate the specific section of this document to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and related material in an unbound format, no larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches, suitable for copying. If you would like to know they reached us, please enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. We will consider all comments and material received during the comment period. We may change this proposed rule in view of them.     We are using 30-day comment period for this rulemaking. Due to the localized interest in this proposed regulation, we feel that this comment period will allow all interested parties enough time to file comments with the Coast Guard. Additionally, because the Alaska cruise season is seasonal, a shorter comment period is needed in order to allow for publication of a Final Rule before the 2001 season ends in mid-September.  [[Page 20771]]  Public Meeting      We do not now plan to hold a public meeting. But you may submit a request for one to the docket at the address under ADDRESSES explaining why one would be beneficial. If we determine that one would aid this rulemaking, we will hold one at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register.  Background and Purpose      Congress passed ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' of the Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5666) on December 21, 2000 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (P.L. 106-554) [``Title XIV''] in response to public concern with environmental impacts of cruise vessels on Alaska waters. This legislation was drafted in the wake of past incidents of illegal wastewater discharges, the discovery of high levels of fecal coliform in legal discharges of treated sewage and graywater, the projected growth of the industry, and the trend within the industry towards larger vessels that carry over 5000 people. In December of 1999, a task force comprised of representatives from the federal government, State government, the cruise industry, and environmental groups was established to develop voluntary procedures for sampling and analyzing wastes generated by cruise vessels while operating in Alaska's waters during the 2000 cruise vessel season.     During the summer 2000 cruise season, the relevant segment of the cruise industry voluntarily agreed not to discharge treated sewage or graywater while in port, not to discharge garbage or untreated sewage in Southeast Alaska's ``Donut Holes'' (bodies of water greater than three miles from any shoreline yet within Alaska's inside passage), and not to discharge treated sewage or graywater, unless more than 10 miles from port and proceeding at a speed of not less than 6 knots.     Additionally, a voluntary sampling and testing protocol and Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QPC) for treated sewage and graywater were developed. The protocol and QA/QPC were applied to 21 cruise vessels calling on Alaska ports during the 2000 season.     The test results revealed that the majority of the vessels' discharges, both treated sewage and graywater, exceeded marine sanitation device (MSD) design standards for water quality of 200 fecal coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter total suspended solids (TSS). The high levels of fecal coliform and TSS found in treated sewage indicate that the MSDs used by cruise vessels may not be operating properly or functioning as designed. The Coast Guard boarded 15 vessels as a result of high fecal coliform and TSS levels. Five vessels were found to have evidence of improperly functioning MSDs. The source of the high fecal coliform and TSS found in graywater has yet to be positively determined.     Concurrent with this voluntary sampling process, Congress was drafting legislation that addressed sewage and graywater discharges in Alaska's waters and sought to close the ``Donut Holes'' located in Southeast Alaska's Inside Passage to untreated sewage discharge. This legislation was enacted into law on December 21, 2000, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 in the form of Title XIV.     These proposed regulations are in response to Title XIV statutory mandate to draft implementing regulations. Section 1406 of Title XIV directs the Secretary to incorporate into the commercial vessel examination program an inspection regime sufficient to verify that operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and visiting ports in the State of Alaska or operating in the applicable waters of Alaska are in full compliance with the environmental record keeping and equipment requirements of Title XIV, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, and any regulations issued there under, other applicable Federal laws and regulations, and all applicable international treaty requirements. The applicable waters of Alaska are defined as the waters of the Alexander Archipelago, the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska, and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.  Discussion of Proposed Rule      This rule would establish a regime for documentation and testing of treated sewage and graywater effluent as prescribed by Title XIV. The rule would apply to cruise vessels that carry at least 500 passengers, and operate in the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska. This area extends out three nautical miles from the shore along any portion of land that is included within the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska. The rule also would apply to the same class of cruise vessels that operate in the Alexander Archipelago and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The area designated as ``The Alexander Archipelago'' is defined in this proposed rule at Sec. 159.305. The definition closes areas of the Archipelago that would otherwise be open to dumping of untreated sewage. The rule would not affect normal transit through the designated areas. The rule would not apply in an emergency situation that threatens the safety of the vessel or its passengers.     Under this rule cruise vessels would maintain a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book while operating in the applicable waters of Alaska. The content of the record book is designed to enable appropriate Coast Guard oversight of sewage and graywater handling practices and ensure compliance with Title XIV. The prescribed format is intended to facilitate both the entry of data, as well as the review of data by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is interested in input from the cruise industry and interested members of the public on any additional information that should be included in the Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book to enhance data collection and interpretation of sample test results.     This rule would prohibit the discharge of untreated sewage within the designated areas. It also provides for sewage and graywater discharge effluent standards, and establishes an interim treated sewage standard. To discharge treated sewage and graywater while in the applicable waters of Alaska, a cruise vessel would need to be underway at a speed of at least 6 knots and be at least one nautical mile from the nearest shore. Further, the vessel's discharge would need to comply with all applicable effluent standards, including those contained within this rule. Lastly, the vessel could not be in an area where such discharge is prohibited. There are currently no areas within the applicable waters of Alaska that have been designated as an area where such discharge is prohibited.     The rule also would allow for discharges of treated sewage and graywater inside of one mile from shore and at speeds less than six knots for vessels with effluent treatment systems that can treat sewage and graywater to a much stricter standard. To employ this provision a vessel would have to provide 30 days notice of the intended discharge to the appropriate Captain of the Port (COTP). In the notice the vessel would verify that the effluents it intends to discharge meet the minimum fecal coliform and residual chlorine standards listed in 159.307(b) of this rule and the standards set forth in 40 CFR 133.102. To satisfy these standards the vessel would provide to the COTP the test results of 5 samples taken over a 30-day period that meet the requirements. Further, for a vessel to  [[Page 20772]]  use this exemption it would have to demonstrate its continued compliance with this proposed rule by sampling and testing for conventional pollutants, as defined in 40 CFR Part 401.16, periodically as determined by the COTP and in accordance with the cruise vessel's Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP).     To ensure a viable sampling regime it is necessary to conduct sampling in accordance with a thorough and well developed QA/QPC with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP). These documents would define the vessel, sampler, and laboratory's responsibilities in the process of discharge sampling and analysis to ensure the results are timely and accurate. The vessel owner/operator, and/or subcontracted sampling team and laboratory, using the outline in the regulation as a minimum standard, may craft the plans. Sample plans may be obtained from the Seventeenth Coast Guard District (moc) office or the Coast Guard Marine Safety office in Juneau, Alaska. Under the proposed rule the Coast Guard will review and either accept or reject the plans, and determine when and from which sampling ports samples will be drawn. In accordance with the accepted plans, a third party, contracted by the cruise vessel, would conduct the sampling and deliver the samples to a laboratory for analysis.     Between 30 and 120 days prior to coming into the applicable waters of Alaska, cruise vessel owners/operators would self certify that the vessel's effluents meet the minimum standards established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. In the absence of such standards they would certify that they meet the minimum standards described in this rule. Title XIV provides for the Administrator to establish minimum effluent standards for treated sewage and graywater, but does not mandate that they do so. In the event the Administrator does establish effluent standards, they would supersede the standards listed in this rule. If a vessel is not able to certify their effluents for treated sewage and graywater as meeting the applicable standards, operational controls would be placed on the vessel by the COTP, directing the vessel not to discharge treated sewage and graywater in the applicable waters of Alaska.     A cruise vessel can expect to be sampled a minimum of two times while operating in the applicable waters of Alaska during a calendar year: Once, within 30 days after first arriving at the start of the cruise season, and a second sometime during the remainder of the vessel's cruise season. During either of the two sampling events, additional samples may be drawn from randomly selected discharge ports for priority pollutant analysis.     The proposed rule would allow for additional sampling, at the discretion of the COTP to ensure continued compliance throughout the operating season and to follow-up on high-test sample results.     All costs associated with compliance with this proposed rule will be paid by the cruise vessels operating in the applicable waters of Alaska, except for costs of oversight and enforcement by the Coast Guard.     Tests results for the samples would be forwarded to the COTP directly by the laboratory conducting the analysis. The time schedule specified in the rule is an industry standard for laboratories qualified to complete the analysis. The laboratory will hold the samples for six months in the case of disputed results. After six months the samples become unusable for any further beneficial analysis and should be discarded.     The reports the laboratory must submit on sample test results may be in an electronic form. However, if submitted electronically, they must be in a format readable by the Coast Guard and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation's (ADEC) data systems. Currently, the Coast Guard and ADEC use a Windows operating system.     Finally, the proposed rule sets out the penalties that might be assessed if a cruise vessel is found discharging effluent that does not meet the applicable standards.  Regulatory Evaluation      This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, l979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT follows:     A Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) is required by these regulations to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise vessel sampling program a single QA/QCP, acceptable to the Coast Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each vessel. It is anticipated the same, or similar depending on the laboratory used, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop new ones. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP and VSSP, if any.     The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs are expected.     During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program, the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40 CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348. The estimated cost to each cruise vessel line is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Cruise line                      Vessels      Cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Princess Cruises..................................          6    $56,088 Holland American..................................          6     56,088 Celebrity.........................................          2     18,696 Norwegian.........................................          2     18,696 Royal Caribbean...................................          2     18,696 Carnival..........................................          1      9,348 Japan.............................................          1      9,348 World Explorer....................................          1      9,348 Crystal Cruises...................................          1      9,348  [[Page 20773]]  Radisson Seven Seas...............................          1      9,348 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      The cost is based on two sampling events on each cruise vessel. One sample event would be required within 30 days of entering Alaska waters. The second sample event, although discretionary by the Coast Guard, will be taken from vessels that visit Alaskan waters at least four times a year. Additional samples and analysis may be required, along with the associated cost increase, should the initial sample results indicate noncompliance.     The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the costs that might be incurred if a cruise vessel cannot certify that their discharges meet the applicable standards, and does not have the capacity to hold all of its discharges while transiting the applicable waters of Alaska. In that scenario, it is believed that the cruise vessel would need to alter its cruise itinerary in order to leave the applicable Alaskan waters and enter the high seas, thus enabling the vessel to discharge. We would appreciate any comments that might help us accurately assess these costs.  Small Entities      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term ``small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.     The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is due to the fact that the cruise vessels that would be subject to this proposed rule will be carrying 500 or more passengers. Typically, these cruise vessels are owned by corporations that do not qualify as small entities.     If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.  Assistance for Small Entities      Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please contact LCDR Spence Wood where listed at FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  Collection of Information      This rule provides for a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). As defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(c), ``collection of information'' includes reporting, record keeping, monitoring, posting, labeling, and other, similar actions. The title and description of the collections, a description of the respondents, and an estimate of the total annual burden follow. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing sources of data, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection.     Title: Discharge of Effluents in Certain Alaskan Waters by Cruise Vessel Operations.     Summary of the Collection of Information: The following information will be required to be collected by these regulations:  Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP). Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book. Sewage and graywater sampling test results.      Need for Information: Compliance and enforcement of ``Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' (P.L. 106-554).     Proposed Use of Information: Regulatory oversight and compliance assurance.     Description of the Respondents: Master or other person having charge of each cruise vessel authorized to carry 500 or more passengers while operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska and within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.     Number of Respondents: 23     Frequency of Response: Periodically while operating in the waters described above.     Burden of Response: There are three separate record keeping requirements involved in this regulation. Each is addressed separately, and the estimated total burden follows:     1. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) development costs. A QA/QCP with VSSP is required by these regulations to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise vessel sampling program, a single QA/QCP acceptable to the Coast Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each vessel and sampling was conducted in compliance with these documents. It is anticipated the same, or similar, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop a new QA/QCP or VSSP. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP or VSSP, if any.     2. Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book costs. The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs are expected.     3. Sample collection and analysis costs.     a. During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program, the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40 CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is expected to increase  [[Page 20774]]  from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348.     Estimated Total Annual Burden: The estimated total annual burden is $215,460.     As required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Coast Guard has submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its review of the collection of information.     The Coast Guard solicits public comment on the collection of information to: (1) Evaluate whether the information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Coast Guard, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the Coast Guard's estimate of the burden of the collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) minimize the burden of the collection on those who are to respond, as by allowing the submittal of responses by electronic means or the use of other forms of information technology.     Persons submitting comments on the collection of information should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under ADDRESSES by the date under DATES.     Persons are not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Before the requirements for this collection of information become effective, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the Federal Register of OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove the collection.  Federalism      Under Executive Order 13132, section 3(b), the Coast Guard finds that a program monitoring effluent discharge from cruise ships transiting certain Alaskan waters is in the national interest, as evidenced by Congress in enacting ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (Public Law 106-554). In that legislation, Congress empowered the Coast Guard to monitor wastewater discharges from cruise ships transiting certain Alaskan waters.     The sampling, testing and log-keeping program outlined in this regulation was taken from a similar program that was run on a voluntary basis during the summer of 2000. That program was one of the results of the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative, which grew out of a working group composed of representatives from the cruise industry, the public, environmental groups, and state and federal government. The Coast Guard was one of the federal government representatives on that group. The working group was begun by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in December of 1999.     At the conclusion of the 2000 Alaskan cruise ship season, data from the voluntary wastewater sampling and testing program showed that none of the tested vessels were in full compliance with all federal performance standards for the discharge of treated sewage. This data, as well as data showing high levels of pollutants in graywater, spurred the legislation cited above. It also spurred a meeting between the Alaska governor, ADEC, the Coast Guard, and members of the cruise ship industry in November of 2000. At this meeting, the governor expressed his approval of the then-proposed Title XIV, and the greater authority it granted to the Coast Guard to protect Alaskan waters from pollutants.     This established cooperation between the Coast Guard and the State of Alaska, and the State's support of the legislation and voluntary testing program on which the regulation is based shows how the Coast Guard has consulted with State officials in accordance with Executive Order 13132, Section 3(b). The Coast Guard will continue to consult the State by sharing the results of sample tests with the State, as well as requiring that discharge logbooks be kept in a format readable by the Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation.     Section 6(c)(2) of Executive Order 13132, requires, that if the agency promulgating the regulations intends that they have preemptive effect, it state that intention and the rationale on which it is based. Accordingly, the following statement is provided:     Section 1411 (b) P.L. 106-554 specifies that, ``[n]othing in this Title shall in any way affect or restrict, or be construed to affect or restrict, the authority of the State of Alaska or any political subdivision thereof--(1) to impose additional liability or additional requirement; * * *.'' This language, as well as the entire Title, is identical to suggested text submitted to Congress by the Department of Transportation as part of a draft Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000. While the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000 did not pass, the provisions of Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations did become law in P.L. 106-554. The Department of Transportation's letter transmitting the Administration's proposed alternative, which eventually became Title XIV of P.L. 106-554, contained an explanation of Section 1411, as follows:      There are a number of provisions in the Administration's substitute language that would benefit from guidance in a conference report. In particular, we would like to draw the Conferees attention to Section 715 [1411] of the Administration's proposed alternative to Title VII of H.R. 820, as adopted by the Senate, which contains the `Savings Clause.' In its drafting efforts, the Administration modeled section 715 [which is identical to Section 1411] after Section 1018 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 33 U.S.C. 2718. Section 1018 of OPA was recently interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of U.S. v. Locke, 120 S. Ct. 1135 (Mar. 6, 2000). The case concerned Washington State efforts to regulate oil tankers. The Court held that OPA section 1018 does not alter the preemptive impact of the Federal regulatory regime in the areas of design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, manning and casualty reporting for vessels. It is the intent of the Administration that section 715 be interpreted in the same manner as OPA section 1918, so that future litigation on the subject of Federal preemption of vessel regulation can be avoided.  Accordingly, these interim rules are construed in the same manner described in the Department of Transportation's views letter cited above. Thus, any of these regulations, which have the effect of regulating a cruise vessel's design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, manning and casualty reporting have preemptive effect under existing U.S. laws and treaties to which the United States is a party.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) governs the issuance of Federal regulations that require unfunded mandates. An unfunded mandate is a regulation that requires a State, local, or tribal government or the private sector to incur direct costs without the Federal Government's having first provided the funds to pay those costs. This proposed rule would not impose an unfunded mandate.  Taking of Private Property      This proposed rule would not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.  [[Page 20775]]  Civil Justice Reform      This proposed rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.  Protection of Children      We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.  Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments      This proposed rule will not have tribal implications; will not impose substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments; and will not preempt tribal law. Therefore, it is exempt from the consultation requirements of Executive Order 13175. If tribal implications are identified during the comment period we will undertake appropriate consultations with the affected Indian tribal officials.  Environment      We have considered the environmental impact of this proposed rule and concluded that, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(d), of Commandant Instruction M16475.lC, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposed regulation would require operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers in Alaskan waters to document treated sewage and graywater discharges to ensure that they comply with effluent discharge standards. The content of effluent discharges reflects compliant equipment operations. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket where indicated under ADDRESSES.  List of Subjects      Sewage disposal, Vessels, Reporting and record keeping requirements.

Sec. 159.319  Fecal coliform and total suspended solids standards.      (a) Treated sewage effluent discharges--Until such time as the Administrator promulgates effluent discharge standards for treated sewage, treated sewage effluent discharges in the applicable waters of Alaska shall not have a fecal coliform bacterial count of greater than 200 per 100 ml nor total suspended solids greater than 150 mg/l.     (b) Graywater effluent discharges [Reserved.]  Sec. 159.321  Enforcement.      (a) Administrative penalties.     (1) Violations. Any person who violates this subpart may be assessed a class I or class II civil penalty by the Secretary or his delegatee.     (2) Classes of penalties.     (i) Class I. The amount of a class I civil penalty under this section may not exceed $10,000 per violation, except that the maximum amount of any class I civil penalty under this section shall not exceed $25,000. Before assessing a civil penalty under this subparagraph, the Secretary or his delegatee shall give to the person to be assessed such penalty written notice of the Secretary's proposal to assess the penalty and the opportunity to request, within 30 days of the date the notice is received by such person, a hearing on the proposed penalty. Such hearing shall not be subject to 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556, but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.     (ii) Class II. The amount of a class II civil penalty under this section may not exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, except that the maximum amount of any class II civil penalty under this section shall not exceed $125,000. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a class II civil penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions as in the case of civil penalties assessed and collected after notice and an opportunity for hearing on the record in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.     (3) Rights of interested persons.     (i) Public notice. Before issuing an order assessing a class II civil penalty under this paragraph, the Secretary shall provide public notice of and reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed issuance of each order.     (ii) Presentation of evidence. Any person who comments on a proposed assessment of a class II civil penalty under this section shall be given notice of any hearing held under this paragraph and of the order assessing such penalty. In any hearing held under this paragraph (a)(3), such person shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence.     (iii) Rights of interested persons to a hearing. If no hearing is held under paragraph (a)(2) before issuance of an order assessing a class II civil penalty under this section, any person who commented on the proposed assessment may petition, within 30 days after the issuance of such an order, the Secretary or his delegatee to set aside such order and provide a hearing on the penalty. If the evidence presented by the petitioner in support of the petition is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order, the Secretary, or his delegatee, shall immediately set aside such order and provide a hearing in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. If the Secretary or his delegatee denies a hearing under this clause, the Secretary of his delegatee shall provide to the petitioner and  [[Page 20778]]  publish in the Federal Register notice of and the reasons for such denial.     (b) Civil judicial penalties.     (1) Generally. Any person who violates this subpart shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation.     (2) Limitation. A person is not liable for a civil judicial penalty under this paragraph for a violation if the person has been assessed a civil administrative penalty under paragraph (a) of this section for the violation.     (c) Determination of amount. In determining the amount of a civil penalty under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the court or the Secretary or his delegatee shall consider the seriousness of the violation, any history of such violations, any good-faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and other such matters as justice may require.     (d) Criminal Penalties.     (1) Negligent violations. Any person who negligently violates this subpart commits a Class A misdemeanor.     (2) Knowing violations. Any person who knowingly violates this subpart commits a Class D felony.     (3) False Statements. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any record, report or other document filed or required to be maintained under this subpart, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any testing or monitoring device or method required to be maintained under this subpart commits a Class D felony.     (e) Awards.     (1) The Secretary or his delegatee or the court, when assessing any fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay from any fines or civil penalties collected under this section an amount not to exceed one-half of the penalty or fine collected to any individual who furnished information which leads to the payment of the penalty or fine. If several individuals provide such information, the amount shall be divided equitably among such individuals. No officer or employee of the United States, the State of Alaska or any Federally recognized Tribe who furnishes information or renders service in the performance of his or her official duties shall be eligible for payment under this paragraph (e)(1).     (2) The Secretary, his delegatee, or a court, when assessing any fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay, from any fines or civil penalties collected under this section, to the State of Alaska or any Federally recognized Tribe providing information or investigative assistance which leads to payment of the penalty or fine, an amount which reflects the level of information or investigative assistance provided. Should the State of Alaska or a Federally recognized Tribe and an individual under paragraph (e)(1) of this section be eligible for an award, the Secretary, his delegatee, or the court, as the case may be, shall divide the amount equitably.     (f) Liability in rem. A cruise vessel operated in violation of this subpart is liable in rem for any fine imposed under paragraph (c) of this section or for any civil penalty imposed under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, and may be proceeded against in the United States district court of any district in which the cruise vessel may be found.

EPA                Enforcement Officers Make Gulf Violators Pay                From illegal discharges to ocean dumping,                EPA enforcement officers let companies know it doesn't pay to pollute                the Gulf of Mexico.                Actually, Taylor Sharpe, an enforcement                officer at EPA-Dallas, says companies that operate offshore oil                platforms in the Gulf ""are getting very good at controlling pollutant                discharges into Gulf waters, but sometimes a company will mess up.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Illegal Discharges                              An Oklahoma company that operates                drilling platforms in 10 different regions of the Gulf operated                one platform without the required EPA permit for three years. Sharpe                says the platform was discharging produced water. National Pollutant                Discharge Elimination System permits are required under the Clean                Water Act to discharge produced water or produced sand by-products                from oil or gas operations in the Gulf. The permit limits the amount                of oil and grease such discharges may include.                ""The company had permits for other                platforms, but they were operating one illegally,"" says Sharpe.                EPA-Dallas filed an enforcement action, and the company agreed to                settle for a penalty of $67,000.                ""They claimed it was an administrative                oversight, and it may have been,"" says Sharpe, ""but now they are                committed to doing a better job, and the Gulf will be cleaner.""                A California Company                A large California oil company recently                paid a penalty of $66,000 after violating its permit that required                using new, cleaner synthetic drilling mud in the Gulf. ""The company                was headed in the right direction,"" says Sharpe, ""They were switching                to a cleaner product, but the transition was not legal because old                drilling mud remained in the equipment and was being discharged                along with the new.""                ""They were saving the company money,                but it was not a good technical solution,"" he added.                Sharpe says oil companies operating                over 4,000 oil and gas platforms in the Gulf are doing a good job                protecting its waters, ""definitely much better than 20 years ago.""                But there are still violations, he says, mostly by individual platform                employees who try to take shortcuts.                Sharpe says more EPA-Dallas enforcement                actions can be expected.                Gulf Dumping                Earlier this year, a federal jury                convicted a Canadian man for illegally dumping trash bags full of                asbestos into the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. The man had been                hired to lead a crew to remove asbestos from an old ferry boat,                which eventually was to be transformed into a riverboat gambling                casino.                To save time and money, the crew bagged                up the debris and dumped it during a voyage south from San Diego,                through the Panama Canal, across the Gulf to Mobile, Alabama.                Lisa DeSiderio, resident agent in                charge of EPA's San Diego Border Office, says witnesses reported                ""hundreds"" of bags of asbestos and trash were dumped. Since the                asbestos removal contract was estimated from $600,000 to $1.7 million,                EPA believed a significant amount of asbestos was dumped.                Using crew photographs of the dumping                as evidence, EPA and the FBI obtained an indictment, and Canada                extradited the defendant back to the U.S. late last year. In March                2003 a federal jury in Washington, D.C., convicted the man of conspiracy                and violating both the Ocean Dumping Act and the Act to Prevent                Pollution from Ships. DeSiderio says sentencing is set for late                August.                An $18 Million Verdict                A large cruise ship operator last                year pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to pay $18 million                in fines and restitution. Six cruise ships had illegally dumped                oily waste with bilge water into the Gulf and other locations. Shipping                lines are required to treat bilge water to reduce oil content or                dispose of it onshore. Untreated bilge water can harm sea life significantly.                Company employees allegedly ran fresh                water past the sensors in the ships' oil water separators to fool                detection equipment, and kept false records on the discharges. The                company was assessed probation for three to five years and agreed                to hire new personnel as part of an environmental compliance program.                The case was investigated by EPA's                Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Department of Transportation,                the FBI and the U.S. Customs Service.                Obviously, not only EPA, but the entire                U.S. government, will act to ensure violators don't profit from                polluting the Gulf of Mexico.

Volume one contains chapters one through three and the referenced appendix. Volume two contains the Partners' respective Fiscal Year 2001 workplans. The following chapter outlines the background, unique purpose, and benefits of this Partnership Agreement, lists the parties to it, cites the legal authority for establishing such a partnership, provides a description of the scope of the Agreement, the guiding principles, and priorities of each Agreement Partner. I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE In the last few years, states and the federal government have been entering into agreements that seek to better coordinate efforts to protect human health and the environment. In 1998, Maryland's environmental, public health, and natural resources protection agencies entered into their first agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The purpose of the FY 1998 Agreement between the Maryland Departments of Environment (MDE) and Natural Resources (DNR) (the Departments) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III, was to provide for the development of a long-term, results-based management plan that will improve the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthen the relationship between the Departments and EPA. That Agreement established a multi-year strategic planning/agreement process that set forth Maryland's environmental goals, identified the programs designed to achieve those goals, established and adopted indicators to measure progress, described existing workload responsibilities, defined the State/EPA relationship, and reflected a comprehensive public participation process that will help guide future program direction. In developing the first Agreements, the Partners realized that designing meaningful and substantive partnership agreements that will improve both the environmental results and the way in which the Partners interact in performing their respective responsibilities, would take longer than one agreement cycle. Therefore, the Partners agreed that the first two agreements would document what the environmental conditions and protection activities were at that time, and then target the FY 2000 Agreement as the time frame in which significant changes could begin to be implemented. The FY 2000 Agreement. The FY 2000 Agreement continued the focus on improving the working relationship between the Partners. For example, the Partners implemented the commitments to burden reduction, developed an agreement to use the EPA Fort Meade laboratory facility for training, negotiated federal grant application workplans consistent with the State's strategic planning format, and improved data management coordination. The Partners posted the Agreement and Environmental Indicators on MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us. The FY 2000 Agreement also set the groundwork for exploring fiscal year realignment of federal grants, developing a Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) for MDE's Information Technology (IT) needs, and expanding federal facilities partnership opportunities.

First, the two-year time frame of this Agreement will afford the Partners the necessary time to focus on achieving improved environmental results. Second, this two-year Agreement will support the Partners' commitment to implementing Smart Growth policies. Growth trends and land use decisions directly affect many of the issues that state and federal environmental and public health protection agencies are facing today. The Partners commit to pro-actively address growth and development trends to minimize the adverse impacts to public health and the environment. In 1997, the State of Maryland launched its Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Initiative, which encourages the revitalization of older, developed areas throughout the State and addresses issues such as the increased cost of infrastructure associated with sprawl patterns of development and loss of open space. The Federal Government policy recently was articulated when the U.S. EPA Regions II & III, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Department of Army, among others, signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) committing to ""develop pilot projects with State and local governments to coordinate agency programs in a manner that supports State and local initiatives to manage growth and protect vital resources."" This MOA provides for technical assistance to State and local governments, eliminates federal programmatic incentives to inefficient development patterns, encourages revitalization, such as Brownfields redevelopment, and provides positive land preservation incentives. To explore how the State and federal governments can effectively implement these policies, the Partners will be focusing their efforts on two priority Smart Growth areas: (1) Baltimore Harbor and (2) the Anacostia Watershed, in conjunction with the existing ongoing restoration effort. By using targeted, multi-media teams, the Partners envision achieving greater environmental benefits than the traditional, single media approach to implementing Smart Growth policies. (See New Initiatives discussion for more information.) Note that the Partners have been using multi-media team approaches successfully over the past three agreements to address a variety of issues such as identifying burden reduction opportunities, developing environmental indicators, and improving information management approaches. Benefits. The primary benefits of Partnership Agreements continue to be protecting human health and the environment by improving the mutual effectiveness of Maryland's and EPA's environmental programs and strengthening the relationship between the Departments and EPA. The Partners envision that these Agreements will result in administrative benefits, including, increased flexibility, eliminating administrative burdens, joint goal setting and program evaluation, and reducing federal oversight of programs judged by EPA to be successful. For example, EPA recently assisted MDE in its efforts to relocate its headquarters by providing specifications about designing and building an environmentally friendly facility. In future years, shared State-EPA activities involving assessment, planning, education, compliance assistance, enforcement, reporting, and/or grant writing all can be developed and evaluated in the context of mutually agreed upon environmental goals.

AGREEMENT PARTNERS This Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement is entered into between the Regional Administrator of Region III of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Secretaries of the Maryland Departments of Environment (MDE) and Natural Resources (DNR). The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) continues to provide input into the Agreement process, but is not a signatory to this Agreement. Back to Top  III. AUTHORITY   Environmental and Administrative Operations  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  In 1995, the Joint Committee to Reform Oversight, made up of the Environmental Council of States (ECOS) and EPA, created the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS.) The purpose of NEPPS is to develop new approaches that provide improved environmental outcomes, greater coordination and flexibility, strengthened partnerships between the States and EPA, and administrative savings. In 1996, the U.S. Congress authorized EPA to create a Performance Partnership Grants Program, allowing states to combine various environmental grants into one or more multi-program grants. This approach can provide the states more flexibility in targeting their environmental programs. In 2000, ECOS and EPA re-affirmed their mutual commitment to optimizing NEPPS and utilizing Partnership Agreements as the primary tool for enhancing state-federal environmental protection efforts and improving their working relationship. IV. SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT The Partners agree that nothing in this Agreement should be read or construed to abrogate or alter the responsibilities, authorities, and procedures conferred upon each Partner by statute, regulation, grant, delegation, or authorization agreement. The Departments administer many federally delegated and federally supported programs, including those from EPA, as well as from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Interior, and the Food and Drug Administration, among others. While programs delegated by other federal agencies and programs wholly within the State's authority are described in this Agreement, the statutes and programs covered under this Agreement are all under the EPA's purview and include: The The The The The The The The Clean Air Act; Clean Water Act; Safe Drinking Water Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act; Pollution Prevention Act; Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act.  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  This Agreement also recognizes that the Partners have certain obligations and opportunities to conserve endangered and threatened species and their critical habitat, as set forth in the Endangered Species Act. Back to Top  V. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING MARYLAND'S CITIZENS AND NATURAL RESOURCES Results-based Management Approaches. Both Maryland and the federal government endeavor to link their programs with environmental goals. Maryland, in developing its goals and management objectives, looked first at its environmental and public health conditions. In Maryland, Governor Parris N. Glendening has created a Managing Maryland for Results system, a results-based approach to management that includes strategic planning, continuous quality improvement, and performance planning and evaluation, which includes self assessment. Maryland evaluates and reports its environmental program performance through use of performance measures that include environmental indicators, outcomes, outputs, input, quality and efficiency measures. For example, MDE has integrated the Performance Partnership Agreement, including the environmental indicators and workplan commitments, into its Managing for Results strategic plans. The FY 2001 EnPA workplan commitments may be found in Chapter 4. The federal government performs under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) that is based on the same premise. GPRA requires EPA to develop a five-year  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   strategic plan. Contained within Chapter workplan associated with achieving their Environmental Performance Partnership management systems and commitments  4 of the FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement is EPA's GPRA measures. The FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement has been developed with these in mind.  Public Participation. Involving the public throughout the Environmental Performance Partnership process has been a guiding principle for the Partners. Over the past 3 years, formal public meetings and stakeholder briefings were held at 30 locations across the state. The Partners re-affirm the importance of the public participation process and will continue to pursue opportunities to engage their stakeholders and the public (see discussion under FY 2000 workgroup commitments and new initiatives.) Environmental Justice. In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 ""Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,"" and an accompanying Presidential memorandum, to focus federal attention on the environmental and human health conditions in minority and low-income communities. This Executive Order directed federal agencies to each develop a draft Environmental Justice Strategy. The draft strategy was designed to identify and address disproportionately high exposure and adverse human health effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. The Executive Order states, ""To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, and consistent with the principles set forth in the report on the National Performance Review, each federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States."" In accordance with the Executive Order, EPA Region III will work cooperatively with the State to implement this Executive Order. The Partners agree on the importance of equitable treatment of all people regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, policies, and programs. No person or group of people should shoulder a disproportionate share of adverse environmental impacts as a result of the execution of environmental policies, programs, or initiatives. The Partners are committed to working together to develop programs, activities, and initiatives in the state of Maryland that are consistent with the principles of environmental justice, that build capacity within communities, and that enhance the level of cooperation and understanding with regard to environmental justice. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in all federally assisted programs. As recipients of federal grant funding, Maryland recognizes its obligation under Title VI, and is fully committed to complying with its provisions. In this regard, the Partners are committed to working cooperatively in an effort to develop an enhanced working relationship in an effort to provide education and constructive insights in the development of a strategy for addressing Title VI. Commitment to Effective Enforcement. MDE remains committed to the use of formal enforcement tools. Incorporated by reference into Maryland's Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement is the Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, which specifically describes the enforcement process and lists the number of enforcement actions taken. (For more information about MDE's Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, see MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us.) EPA, too, is committed to effective enforcement. EPA will conduct inspections in Maryland and should violations be discovered, EPA will take timely and appropriate enforcement action in accordance with its timely enforcement policies. EPA enforcement actions in Maryland will be communicated with the appropriate State program managers in accordance with the consultative process (described in Chapter 3  Dispute Resolution) and during quarterly calls with program managers.   One part of MDE's enforcement process involves an activity that MDE has named ""compliance assistance."" Because MDE's nomenclature may lead to some confusion, the following explanation is provided to supplement the description of MDE's enforcement statistic known as ""compliance assistance."" MDE compliance inspectors do not conduct ""compliance assistance visits."" They only conduct compliance inspections. When a compliance inspector discovers either a potential violation or a minor violation that can be quickly corrected, the inspector has the option of advising the facility to correct the problem before a formal enforcement action is taken. If the facility corrects the problem, that correction is counted in the Enforcement Report under the heading of ""compliance assistance."" This activity involves enforcement inspector discretion combined with an attempt to help the facility return to compliance. If the facility fails to correct the problem, then the Department takes an enforcement action and counts the event as a violation resulting in an enforcement action. The minor violation is either voluntarily corrected and counted as ""compliance assistance,"" or it becomes the subject of an enforcement action and is counted as such. Furthermore, an inspection in which an inspector provides discretionary assistance in helping a facility return to compliance after a violation has been noted is not counted as a ""Compliance Assistance Visit."" The individuals making traditional Compliance Assistance Visits are not MDE compliance inspectors. Although MDE recognizes that it is always in the business of informing and advising the regulated community on how to comply with the law, the infinite variations of potential factual patterns make distinguishing one form of contact from another almost impossible. Therefore, all contacts with the regulated community by compliance inspectors are counted as enforcement activity. All ""non-enforcement"" contacts and visits are counted separately. Back to Top  VI.

Reduction of Global and Cross Border Environmental Risks Safe Food Existing Grants and Delegations Under cover of the Agreement and its annual workplan, the Partners will implement the activities and track progress. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Partners may use the environmental indicators found in the FY 2000 EnPA Agreement and on MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us. EPA uses GPRA and core performance measures to evaluate its performance. EPA relies on the State to collect and report the data, primarily through existing grant, authorization, and/or delegation agreements. Specific reporting requirements may be found in these grant and delegation agreements. In addition, each categorical grant includes Quality Assurance Climate Change Effective Management   Planning requirements, which are referenced in MDE's and DNR's Quality Management Plans. Incorporation by Reference MDE and DNR have various documents, including this Agreement, that present their commitments, activities, goals, and objectives. The other documents are incorporated into this Agreement by referencing their existence and by re-affirming their role in setting Maryland's environmental agenda. These documents include: MDE and DNR's State FY 2001 and FY 2002 Managing Maryland for Results budget submissions, The 1983 and 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreements and Restoration Strategies, Chesapeake 2000: A Watershed Partnership, including its various commitments, State Revolving Fund (SRF) Intended Use Plans for Wastewater and Drinking Water, Section 319 Non-Point Source (NPS) Management Plan and Assessment Report, Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs) for Maryland's Coastal Bays, Coastal Zone Management Plan, Clean Water Action Plan, Integrated Natural Resources Assessment, Comprehensive Ground Water Protection Plan, Administrative Assistance Applications, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Cooperative Agreement, Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment Report, Environmental Indicators Report, MDE's Quality Management Plan, DNR's Quality Management Plan, From Mountains to the Sea: The State of Maryland's Freshwater Streams, MDE 2000 Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, and Maryland Environment 2000 (ME 2000) Risk Assessment Report. Back to Top  CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FYs 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES Chapter 2 summarizes the Partners progress in meeting their various partnership commitments and provides information about FYs 2001 and 2002 new initiatives. FY 2000 ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES The Partners (Region III and MDE) have continued to meet on a regular basis (quarterly) using the Consultative Process as their guide (see Chapter 3 for a description of this Process.) During FY 2000 the disagreement elevation procedure was employed on one occasion concerning the Lehigh Portland asphalt facility in Carroll County. EPA Region III awarded MDE a $100,000 grant to develop a pilot project for deriving a statistically valid method for determining the ""compliance rate"" of identified regulated facilities/sectors/ or communities. The grant is to be administered over the next three years by Region III. MDE and Region III successfully completed a series of chemical process safety inspections   at five industrial facilities on the Fairfield peninsula in southeast Baltimore City. There had been several chemical accidents in close proximity to the residential community known as Wagner's Point. The five targeted facilities were inspected by an EPA multi-media and chemical process safety inspection team. The results of those inspections were shared with MDE as well as the targeted facilities and, where necessary, process changes were suggested and made. Coincidentally, since the inspections began, all of the residents in that small residential enclave have been able to relocate through the collective effort of Baltimore City, the State of Maryland, the federal government, and several of the regulated facilities. Working together, the governmental entities, businesses and the community developed a package which offered a fair price for the houses, covered some relocation costs, and provided low-interest loans to help residents acquire new housing. MDE and Region III continue to work cooperatively in the area of multi-media inspections at designated federal facilities. Specifically in FY 2000 MDE and Region III inspectors inspected the Baltimore Marine Industries ship scrapping operation being conducted under Navy a contract. MDE inspectors also participated in and reviewed Region III's multi-media inspection at the Veterans Administration Medical Center at Perry Point. MDE supports Region III's enforcement initiative concerning colleges and universities and will provide Region III with the names of two colleges and/or universities to be the subject of EPA multi-media inspection. In addition to the above referenced initiatives which will continue into FY 2001, MDE and Region III also plan to begin working cooperatively in the area of using Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) as another available form of enforcement action. The Partners will also develop a set of protocols governing notification and coordination on the use of the State and federal environmental audit policies. In this regard MDE and Region III have begun discussion of using outreach to certain identified urban communities to increase compliance with environmental laws in underprivileged urban areas by effective use of voluntary self-disclosure. In addition to the activities listed above (i.e. ship scrapping and Veterans Administration Medical Center at Perry Point) MDE and Region III continue to meet on an as needed basis concerning federal facilities issues, as they arise. MDE participates in a monthly conference call between Region III's federal facilities coordinator and various federal agencies. MDE will participate again this year in the EPA/Department of Defense Colloquium. Back to Top  REVIEW OF FY 2000 WORKGROUP EFFORTS The following summarizes the findings and recommendations of the interagency workgroups. Updating the Environmental Indicators information. The Environmental Indicators are currently available on MDE's Homepage. In addition, there are links on the DNR website to the Indicators. The Partners made a commitment, to the citizens who participated in the public meetings and provided input through electronic and written correspondence, to regularly update the information in the Environmental Indicators Report. Therefore, in the summer of each year, the Partners will update those Indicators where new data are available. In addition, for each Indicator, under the Indicator development and data responsibility information, the Partners will indicate the frequency with which that Indicator will be updated (many Indicators are updated annually, biennially, triennially, etc., as the data are collected). The Partners also will indicate the date that the Indicator was last updated. By regularly updating the Indicators, we will be providing the public the most recent information about the environmental conditions in Maryland. In addition, to enable citizens   with questions to go directly to the source, each Indicator includes both the Program name and the phone number where those staff responsible for Indicator development and data responsibility can be contacted. Public Participation and Outreach. As part of the Partners' commitment to public participation and outreach, six meetings were held across Maryland in January and February 1999. The workgroup posted on MDE's Homepage a ""Response to Questions"" that reflected responses to comments received from the Winter 1999 meetings. The workgroup members briefed various stakeholder committees throughout 2000. Moreover, MDE has been providing information to its employees about EnPA through on-going Human Resources Training (see New Initiatives for more information.) Negotiating Grant Agreements Using MDE's Strategic Plan. MDE grant managers for Underground Storage Tank (UST), Clean Water Act Section 604(b), TSCA asbestos abatement, and Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) grants have been working with EPA to revise the federal grant application workplan to be consistent with the format used for MDE's MFR's submittal to Governor Glendening. This work has been part of the Partner's efforts to further reduce burden associated with grant applications. To apply for FY 2001 federal grants, MDE will be using, where feasible, this revised format for the previously mentioned four grants, and tracking the progress of this new approach throughout the next two years. Managing data systems and identifying data gaps. The purpose of this workgroup was to focus on existing data collection, storage, distribution, and interpretation. Since FY 1999, the workgroup has focused on four areas: (1) adequacy of data, (2) standardized data documentation, (3) data accessibility, and (4) duplication of effort. A status report of their efforts may be found in the Appendix . This workgroup will continue its efforts through FY 2002, providing regular semi-annual reports to Partnership Agreement Coordinating Team (EPACT) throughout the term of the new Agreement. Reducing the reporting burden on Maryland where possible. The purpose of this workgroup was to look at the reporting transactions between the state and federal Partners and to identify specific reporting requirements that can be eliminated, streamlined, reduced and/or changed through new or improved reporting processes. The workgroup has been tracking its recommended reporting burden reductions and is continuing its work on identifying other opportunities for reporting burden reductions in the Minority Business Enterprise/Women Business Enterprise Program (MBE/WBE), the drinking water program (PWSS), and other issue areas. These areas will continue to be evaluated, as well as the air program NOV reporting requirements, as part of the FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement. Training coordination. MDE and EPA have agreed on the use of conference space at EPA's Environmental Science Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, for the purpose of MDE participating in EPA's Air Pollution Training Institute (APTI) satellite classes. This agreement provides MDE convenient access to EPA's teleconferencing facility (see Appendix for more information.) Better aligning the state and federal fiscal year time frames. The purpose of this workgroup was to develop a process that can achieve re-alignment of federal fiscal year activities with the State's fiscal year time frame. The workgroup was tasked with answering: What has to be done? How long will it take? And when should it begin? The workgroup prepared simulations that included detailed analyses of the steps that are needed to assess whether or not such as transition benefits the Partners and how to make the realignment transition. Since FY 2000, MDE has been conducting a pilot program to include one small grant per media administration that would be tracked in the automated federal grant Financial Management Information System (FMIS) component (see Appendix for more information.) The workgroup recommended the UST, TSCA, and Underground Injection Control (UIC) grants and is adding a lead grant to the pilot as well. The pilot is being implemented in parallel with the existing grant system to provide the opportunity to troubleshoot any problems before it may be expanded to include the remaining EPA grants. This effort will continue   throughout the FYs 2001 and 02 time frame. Improving interagency coordination on federal facilities. The purpose of this workgroup was to identify state and EPA personnel with federal facilities responsibilities, list their responsibilities, look for overlap, and establish a process for improved communication and coordination. Moreover, the workgroup was tasked with identifying key opportunities at federal facilities in which the State and Region III could work together to resolve challenging compliance issues. (See New Initiatives for more information.) Multi-year Agreements. As noted above, this Agreement covers the FY 2001 through FY 2002 time frame. The Partners agree to regularly update the environmental indicator data. MDE will be conducting a programmatic self-assessment and DNR will be using an MFR selfassessment process during this time frame. Moreover, to ensure ongoing communication about progress toward meeting the partnership goals, the Partners agree to provide their respective FY 2002 EnPA workplans to each other. Erosion and Sediment Control Compliance Initiative. MDE has been strengthening its erosion and sediment control program, which is an extremely important element in the State's effort to protect and improve water quality. In FY 2000, EPA has provided MDE with TSCA multi-media grant funding to develop procedures that would enlist the services of both public and private interests to pursue voluntary procedures for achieving compliance, utilizing the efforts of Soil Conservation District personnel, aggregate operators, and possibly DNR's Maryland Forest Service. Additional Efforts. There has been a variety of other federal  State partnership efforts in addition to the examples reported above. These include Region III, the states in Region III and the Army Corps of Engineers working together to review the Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program. Topics of discussion include funding status and issues, CERCLIS prescreening, DSMOA reviews, and project prioritization. Back to Top  FYs 2001 AND 2002 NEW INITIATIVES The Partners agree to pursue several new initiatives under this Agreement: Public Participation and Outreach. During FYs 2001 and 2002, the workgroup will place the FYs 2001 & 02 EnPA Agreement on MDE's Homepage. The workgroup members will create opportunities for reviewers to ask questions and make comments on-line. Then the Partners will post responses to questions on-line, create a ""Frequently Asked Questions/Answers about EnPA"" on-line, Notify interested parties by letter who attended meetings that information about EnPA is available on-line and invite them to comment. MDE will advertise in MDEnvironment that the Agreement document is available on-line and provides opportunity for comments. Moreover, the Partners agree to invite interested parties to request a briefing about the current status. Depending on number of requests, the Partners will determine feasibility of holding meetings. Other ideas include: q  Target State Fair/MACO  create palm card or reference sheet that lists information available on Homepage, which includes EnPA, and state that comments can be made on-line. Engage Existing Audiences  Have Palm Card or Reference Sheet with information about Homepage, which includes EnPA, stating there is an opportunity to provide comments on-line about environmental priorities. Target community associations that hold regular meetings.  q  q   Smart Growth Projects. The Partners agree to pursue or undertake pilot projects that demonstrate the benefits of smart growth policies. For example, air quality benefits from state land use strategies in non-attainment areas or maintenance areas can be applied as a credit to State Implementation Plans. Or, these benefits may be part of state conformity determinations, where EPA has assurance that such strategies have produced the air quality benefits through reduced emissions from transportation-related sources. The Partners agree to evaluate land use strategies for potential air quality credits. Moreover, EPA is willing to provide workshops and training sessions for the State and various metropolitan planning organizations on developing air quality credits from various land use scenarios. Another example may include the Partners' willingness to develop pilot efforts to develop innovative approaches that will tailor the implementation of federal programs to reinforce the State's growth management objectives. Under this effort, EPA is willing to focus available federal resources on reinforcing local and State planning and environmental preservation objectives. This could be accomplished by providing technical assistance and tailoring regulatory approaches that would minimize possible regulatory burdens for development activity in priority funding areas. As noted earlier, the Partners will pursue these approaches in the Baltimore Harbor and Anacostia Watershed regions. Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project. This project entails a multi-year effort to prepare tracts of land for redevelopment in a heavily industrialized and underutilized section of Baltimore City, the Carroll/Camden Industrial area. This pilot project supports EPA and MDE EnPA redevelopment objectives (i.e., Brownfields) and will result in a measurable environmental benefit in support of the Partners' commitment to implementing Smart Growth policies. For the project to undertaken, the Partners agree to identify possible project funding sources before the end of December 2000. Over the FYs 2001 & 02 time frame, the Partners will meet to review a variety of possible sources of multi-media funding in support of this proposed multi-year effort. (For more information see the Appendix.) Performance Partnership Grant for MDE's Information Technology. A key component to the success of MDE's Information Technology (IT) reorganization of systems, personnel, and information infrastructure, is the realignment of MDE's financial resources that support its information management systems. MDE believes this alignment can be accomplished through the establishment of a Performance Partnership Grant for Information Technology (IT PPG). The benefits associated with this IT PPG include, but are not limited, to: reduced administration paperwork in the Department for tracking and managing information technology related financial assistance; enhanced ability for the Department to leverage it's resources by pulling money together that will give the Department more buying power in the information technology market; and provide the ability to better control and direct funding to achieve the partners' goals in a more holistic fashion. This would eliminate the traditional ""stove pipe"" approach to information technology management. MDE and EPA agree to develop and implement an IT PPG during FY 2001. Exploring P2 Opportunities with Federal Facilities. In addition to the previously-mentioned cooperative efforts between MDE and federal facilities, the Partners agreed to explore the possibility of developing a formal ""Pollution Prevention Agreement"" among the State, EPA, and the federal facilities located in Maryland. This Agreement would seek to memorialize the federal facilities' current pollution prevention (P2) efforts and identify opportunities for providing further information transfer and sharing of successes to other Maryland facilities. Specifically, the goals include: identifying P2 opportunities at federal facilities; promoting the use of P2 as the preferred environmental policy at Maryland Department of Defense (DoD) facilities; promoting a P2 information clearinghouse; promoting DoD mentoring with Businesses for the Bay; and promoting the integration of P2 into everyday activities at all Maryland-based DoD installations. Commitment to Educate and Train Workforce on EnPA and NEPPS. The Partners recognize that the NEPPS system and Partnership Agreements provide a new and different   framework for achieving environmental and public health protection. Currently, many of the individuals who are performing the tasks associated with environmental and public health protection do not have a complete understanding of the opportunities and benefits NEPPS and Partnership Agreements can provide. Therefore, MDE and EPA agree to begin or continue conducting education and training of their respective workforce on NEPPS and Partnership Agreements. The purpose of this effort is to ensure that all individuals involved in Maryland  EPA activities are knowledgeable about NEPPS and have opportunities to contribute ideas and strategies for achieving greater environmental successes by using the new system. Further Burden Reduction. The Partners agree to continue implementing the recommendations of the FY1999/2000 Reporting Workgroup and to track progress. EPA agrees to pursue the MBE/WBE reporting issues and to seek help in reducing/refining the data collection and reporting burden on states. The Partners agree to inform their respective program staff of the need to identify potential opportunities for reporting burden reduction during grant negotiations and through the annual programmatic review process. Program staff shall be encouraged to look for innovative ways to streamline reporting so long as core regulatory requirements are met. Moreover, the Partners commit to an analysis of the grant, policy, and regulatory reporting requirements of the Drinking Water Program, including an evaluation of why the information is needed, how it is used, and opportunities to streamline the reporting process. The Workgroup will meet quarterly and report semi-annually to the E-PACT. Quality Management Plans. Region III approved MDE's Quality Management Plan (QMP) in Fiscal 2000. MDE is working toward writing or revising Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs) for all appropriate programs or projects or business processes where standard operating procedures are necessary to ensure the collection and management of quality environmental data. In FY 2001, MDE will submit to EPA the QAPPs for all federally assisted programs in a format that is agreed to by the Partners. MDE has prepared a generic template that all programs are using to prepare the QAPPs. EPA will assist MDE and DNR with specialized training on developing, writing, and maintaining effective QAPPs. Back to Top  CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT The Partners are committed to improving the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthening the relationship between the State and EPA. This chapter outlines how the Partners will communicate and coordinate, resolve any disputes that might arise, and identifies the members of the Partnership Coordinating Team. I. COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION The Partners agree to communicate on a regularly scheduled basis, and to discuss the overall progress of the activities in the Agreement. These activities, to be successful, are dependent upon MDE, DNR, and EPA dedicating personnel to implement, or modify if necessary, the Agreement once all parties adopt it. To ensure ongoing communication, each party has designated a point of contact. MDE's designated person chairs Maryland's Performance Partnership Coordinating Team (E-PACT), which is made up of key personnel from each participating agency, as well as a representative from MDA, who serves in an advisory capacity. The E-PACT will take part in regularly scheduled conference calls and in-person meetings to foster improvements in the Performance Partnership process and ensure that issues identified in the Agreement are resolved during the course of the year. A key objective of the E-PACT will be to quickly and efficiently resolve these issues by setting and meeting deadlines for resolution.   Back to Top  II. DISPUTE RESOLUTION The Partners are committed to timely resolution of disputes. The Partners agree to treat the resolution process as an opportunity to improve our joint efforts. With reference to enforcement and compliance issues, the consultative process identified earlier will be used in dispute resolution. On all other issues, the following procedures will be used: PRINCIPLE - all disputes should be resolved at the front line or staff level. TIMEFRAME - generally, disputes should be resolved as quickly as possible but within 2 weeks of their arising at the staff level. If unresolved at the end of 2 weeks, the issue should be raised to the next level of each organization. ELEVATION - when there is no resolution and the 2 weeks have passed, there should be comparable elevation in each organization, accompanied by a statement of the issue and a one-page issue paper. A conference call between the parties should be held as soon as possible. Disputes that need to be raised to a higher level should again be raised in comparable fashion in each organization.

MDE AND EPA GOALS MDE GOAL #1: ENSURING THE AIR IS SAFE TO BREATHE Under both Federal and State law, MDE is charged with ensuring that the air is safe for all Marylanders to breathe. The State and federal governments continuously evaluate the human health effects of airborne pollutants. For example, in response to recent studies regarding the health effects of small particles and aerosols, EPA has added a new fine particulate matter national ambient air quality standard for particles 2.5 microns or smaller. EPA has also revised the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. These standards have been challenged by several parties and will be reviewed by the Supreme Court in its session beginning in October 2000. The challenge does not reduce Maryland's efforts associated with meeting the one-hour ozone standard. Over the next few years, should the Court find in EPA's favor, Maryland will be working with EPA to implement the new health-based standards. The key areas of emphasis described below relate to: (1) Reducing the amount and frequency of high levels of ground-level ozone; (2) Reducing the amount of toxic pollutants discharged into the environment; (3) Maintaining attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants other than ozone; (4) Reducing the amount of acid rain; (5) Ensuring that asbestos removal activities do not endanger human health and (6) Reducing the occurrence of air pollution nuisance conditions, such as from natural wood waste facilities. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Although exceedences of the one-hour health-based ambient air quality standard continue to be measured throughout much of Maryland, the monitored one-hour ozone levels show a general downward trend. It is difficult to draw conclusions by comparing one year of data to another because of the impact of differing meteorological conditions from year to year. Generally, however, the number of ozone exceedances has decreased as well as the severity of the exceedance, i.e. the concentration measured. The Department has also begun reporting the ozone data on an eighthour basis for comparison to the eight-hour ozone standard promulgated by the EPA in 1997. The Maryland data indicate that there are numerous exceedances of the eight-hour standard (more than for the one-hour standard) and the presumption is that an eight-hour standard will be more difficult to meet. That eight-hour standard was the subject of a recent court decision in which the court found EPA's rulemaking to be unconstitutional and the standard was remanded to the agency for further consideration. Significantly, the standard was not vacated and the underlying science was not called into question. EPA is appealing the court decision and the matter has reached the Supreme Court where it will be reviewed during the session that begins in October 2000. The court's decision does not affect Maryland's obligations to continue its work as related to the one-hour ozone standard. Consistent with a Clean Air Act requirement for nonattainment areas, the Department has   I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining  developed a plan to bring the three nonattainment areas of the state into compliance with the federal one-hour ozone standard and is moving forward with its implementation. The plan contains numerous measures to reduce ozone precursor emissions from the three major pollution source sectors in Maryland: mobile, stationary and area. In addition to these measures, pollution reductions are assumed from sources that are located outside of Maryland but which influence our air quality. The plan was submitted to the EPA for their review, and the EPA has concluded that for the Baltimore nonattainment area Maryland needs to do more than is stated in the attainment plan as submitted if Maryland is to demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that attainment with the ozone standard will be achieved by 2005. Specifically, 13 additional tons per day of VOC emission reductions are needed in the Baltimore area. Maryland is working with the Ozone Transport Region states to develop and implement regional reduction measures, such as cleaner fuels and household products, to address the 13-ton need. Similarly, Maryland continues to actively participate in the OTC Regional Planning Organization's efforts to address regional haze in the Mid-Atlantic Region. EPA Region III (Region III) will also provide any technical assistance to MDE in investigating potential VOC reduction strategies to address the 13-ton shortfall in the Baltimore area. EPA Region III is also committed to be an active participant in the OTC Regional Planning Organization's efforts to address regional haze in the Mid-Atlantic Region. It is important to note that the Washington metropolitan area was to be in compliance with the federal ozone standard in 1999. Monitoring data, however, showed that compliance was not achieved in 1999. The principal reason for this was the overwhelming influence of ozone transported from northern Virginia and Washington D.C. into the neighboring Maryland counties of Prince George's and Montgomery. In recognizing this situation and realizing that there is much that needs to be done to bring to fruition measures to address ozone transport, the EPA has granted Maryland an extension of the 1999 compliance deadline to 2005. Reductions in the transport of pollutants from upwind areas into Maryland is key to Maryland being able to achieve compliance with the national health-based standard for ground level ozone. Maryland, therefore, has participated in several regional efforts aimed at addressing the transport problem. One group has been the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), which consists of representatives from the 12 Northeast states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia. As part of the OTC, Maryland signed a resolution calling for reductions in NOx emissions from utilities and other large boilers located in the OTC by May 1, 1999. In 1998, the Department adopted regulations (NOx Budget Rule) to implement these reductions by the agreed deadline. Those regulations were challenged by utilities in Maryland and, as a result, the rules were overturned by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and remanded to the agency for further rulemaking. The Department has since successfully re-promulgated the rules with a new compliance date of May 1, 2000. Region III also continues to be an active participant in the OTC efforts in addressing ground level ozone transport throughout the Northeast, including Maryland. When the rule was re-promulgated, the two major utilities in Maryland, BGE and PEPCO, were not able to have permanent equipment installed at all necessary facilities by the May 2000 deadline, so alternate compliance plans were developed for the 2000 ozone season, which involved, in part, the purchasing of NOx allowances from other sources. Legally binding orders capturing this approach to compliance were entered into in 1999 by both utilities. The Department's focus in FY2001 and beyond will be to track compliance with the orders and the budget rule as reports on electric generation rates, allowance purchases and NOx emission rates are filed throughout the course of the ozone season. A second, more stringent phase of NOx regulation has grown out of another regional effort, known as the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), in which Maryland was involved. OTAG studied the entire area east of the Mississippi River and the contributions of that area to regional ozone pollution. As a result of those studies, OTAG made recommendations to the EPA for   Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  addressing the problem of transported pollution. Based on the OTAG recommendations and its own modeling work, the EPA promulgated a rule in 1998 calling for reductions in NOx emissions from a 22-state area, including the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest. The rule established caps on NOx emissions in each of the affected states and required those states to develop plans to ensure that NOx emissions would stay below the applicable cap. The plans were to be submitted to EPA by September 30, 1999, and emission controls to achieve the necessary reductions were to be in place by May 1, 2003. The State of Michigan, utilities, manufacturers and others, challenged the rule and, as an interim measure, the Court stayed the portion of the rule requiring states to submit plans by September 1999. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia later upheld the EPA rule for 19 of the 22 states initially affected and lifted the stay that was in effect. As such, pollution reduction plans from the 19 affected states are due to the EPA in the fall of 2000. Maryland's plan has already been submitted to EPA, and calls for a cap on NOx emissions from affected sources to be achieved by May 2003 and maintained thereafter. No decision has been made on whether the ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Regardless of the fact that there is a chance the challenge to the EPA rule may be pursued further legally, Maryland and other states in the Northeast have agreed to move forward with their planned regulations to achieve the NOx reductions. Maryland's regulations implementing the EPA requirements have been approved and were effective on May 1, 2000. The reductions are important to reduce transported pollution throughout the Northeast and to reduce NOx emissions in Maryland that not only contribute to air pollution in the form of ozone, but also, through atmospheric deposition, result in the increased introduction of nutrients into the Chesapeake Bay. The Department's focus in this arena will be to track the progress of actions needed to be taken by the affected sources to ensure that physical improvements or allowance purchases will be in place to allow Maryland's 2003 ozone season NOx cap to be met. Region III continues to be an active participant in providing technical and policy support and guidance to the Chesapeake Bay Program's nutrient reduction and restoration efforts, particularly in addressing the impacts of nitrogen atmospheric deposition to the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Region III is also in the process of evaluating Maryland's N0x Budget Rule State Implementation Plan revision submission and will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions on Maryland's proposal. A third effort by Maryland to address the need for reductions in NOx emissions from upwind sources is a petition that was filed in April 1999 under 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petition requests EPA to make a finding that emissions from certain upwind sources are contributing to Maryland's failure to attain the national ambient air quality standard for ozone and to impose restrictions on those sources. Maryland's petition is similar to petitions that were filed by 10 other states in the Northeast. These petitions identify sources in the Midwest as well as within the Northeast. EPA has not yet ruled on Maryland's petition. Another action to address NOx emissions from out-of-state sources has taken the form of a lawsuit involving violations of Major New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements associated with a major mid-western utility. Maryland, along with six other states, has joined the EPA and the Department of Justice in a lawsuit against American Electric Power (AEP) which has ten electric power plants overall in Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. The suit centers on AEP's avoidance of prescriptive NSR and PSD program requirements under the Clean Air Act, with the end result being that the utility failed to install pollution control equipment at the time certain plant improvements were made. The equipment would, among other things, reduce NOx emissions from AEP's plants, which would help clean up the air in the states involved in the lawsuit. The Department intends to remain a part of the suit and will take whatever actions are necessary to see the issue through to the end. In addition to these efforts to limit NOx emissions from large stationary sources, such as utilities, the Department is also engaged in activities to lower emissions from other source sectors.

Recognizing the link between transportation planning and air pollution, Congress established a requirement in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that transportation projects must ""conform"" to the State Implementation Plan in order to be eligible for federal funding. In order to satisfy these conformity requirements, the Attainment Plans for the Washington Nonattainment Area, the Baltimore Nonattainment Area, and Cecil County contain mobile emissions budgets that limit the amount of pollution that vehicles in the nonattainment areas emit collectively. Limits are set for volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. New projects from transportation plans and improvement programs in the nonattainment area cannot result in emissions increases above the budget or federal transportation funds will not be released to the region. The Department develops the budgets in coordination with the Maryland Department of Transportation and the metropolitan planning organization in the nonattainment area. The budgets help reduce emissions from mobile sources so that emission reductions, called rate-ofprogress requirements, from the Clean Air Act can be met. Compliance with the rate of progress requirements is charted through periodic inventories of emissions every three years. The next step in this arena is to revise the mobile source budget for the Baltimore area and Cecil County to include federal Tier 2 car and light truck emission standards and to process this revision as an amendment to the State Implementation Plan. Other measures are planned to address the requirement that transportation projects conform to the State Implementation Plan. Effort is underway and will carry forward for several years to increase the use of alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs) and other beneficial technology vehicles in the Baltimore area. Increasing the infrastructure with the necessary fueling equipment and using marketing techniques to encourage the public to use vehicles not dedicated solely to the use of gasoline is the focus of this exercise. The Department will be responsible for overseeing the activities of the various parties responsible for infrastructure development and promoting the use of the alternative technologies. As time moves forward, the Department's activities will increase with respect to implementing recent legislation aimed at providing tax credits for energy efficient vehicles and at encouraging increased use of rapid transit and decreased levels of vehicle miles traveled. Because of the contributions that everyday activities such as refueling and mowing the lawn make to the pollution problem in Maryland, the Department has made a substantial effort to educate the public on ground-level ozone and its health effects. The Ozone Pollution Map and Ozone Action Days programs are cornerstones of the Department's efforts to increase pollution prevention activities by ordinary citizens. The Map, which Maryland and the American Lung Association jointly developed, will be used in 32 states this year and has achieved semi-finalist status in a national competition, Innovative Programs in Government. The map and the Ozone Action Days program continue as part of Maryland's effort to address its ozone problem. Region III will continue to support Maryland's Ozone Action Partnerships, Ozone Mapping program and associated activities. Other Air Program Activities The Department's air quality compliance and permit programs are two key mechanisms for implementing the strategies necessary to attain and maintain the health-based national air quality standards. The number of air pollution sites generally increases slightly each year: the current number of sites exceeds 10,000. These are more than the Department has resources to inspect. Therefore, the Department makes a selection of facilities each year for which inspections will be made. The sources are selected for inspection based on size, potential impact on air quality, citizen concerns and importance to the regulatory scheme. The Department also has federal grant commitments to inspect major and other sources that are subject to federal regulatory requirements. As a result, about 300 sources, those that have the greatest potential for adverse impact, are earmarked each year for a detailed air quality inspection. Inspections at other facilities  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   are also conducted. Which facilities are inspected is a function of several factors, among them are compliance status, potential for harm, potential for creating a nuisance. Special initiatives are undertaken at times to focus on a single category of sources. For instance, the 60+ asphalt plants in Maryland were inspected and stack tested in one year to get a complete compliance picture of the industry. Also, beginning in early 2000, all dry-cleaning establishments across the State are being inspected to determine compliance with federal air toxics requirements (dry cleaners can emit perchloroethylene, a hazardous air pollutant, if the machines are not tested and maintained regularly). This effort will stretch over the next five years (20% per year will be inspected), after which a decision will be made based on the five-year findings to what extent the effort should continue. Beginning State FY01, ARMA will be inspecting Stage II vapor recovery facilities. Previously, these inspections were conducted by the Department's Waste Management Administration (WAS). Due to changing priorities within WAS, it was mutually agreed that ARMA would undertake the inspection task after the close of FY00. For Region III, please refer to Chapter 2, ""Review of FY 2000 Commitments and FY 2001 New Initiatives,"" which includes the MDE/Region III cooperative agreement with respect to Enforcement and Compliance Activities. The air quality permitting program issues permits to construct, state operating permits, federal Acid Rain Program permits and federal Title V operating permits. Construction permits ensure that air pollution sources are constructed in accordance with air quality regulatory requirements protective of public health and the environment. These permits also ensure that emissions of toxic air pollutants will not endanger public health. About 800 construction permits are issued each year. Operating permits, through the imposition of monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements, ensure that air pollution sources, once constructed and placed in operation, are operated in compliance with air quality requirements. Operating permits are valid for up to five years, after which renewal is required. About 450 sources in Maryland hold state operating permits and 172 of these sources are required to secure a Title V permit. Through the use of an outside contractor, the use of overtime, a temporary shifting of personnel into the Permits Program and the addition of new staff, the Department has issued about one-third of the required Title V permits and is on course to draft the remaining two-thirds in 2000 and to issue them in 2000 and 2001 (FY01 and 02). Acid Rain Program permits are issued to require affected sources to implement the NOx and SO2 emission reduction provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA issued Acid Rain Program permits to four sources in Maryland as part of Phase I of the Program under the Clean Air Act. The Department has since issued such permits to the remaining affected sources. Acid Rain Permit compliance tracking and audits of emission monitoring equipment installed under the Program will take place in 2000 and beyond. Maryland operates a program to control the emissions of toxic air pollutants, and has done so since 1988. The program includes a technology and a public health protection element. Similarly, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to control the emissions of 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The control is to be done through a two-step process. The first is the setting of technology standards, called Maximum Achievable Control Technology, and the second is examining the residual risk associated with the particular HAP. If, after such examination, an unacceptable level of risk remains, then further reductions of HAP emissions would be sought. The EPA is partway through the standard-setting process: MACT standards for 86 HAPs have been issued, 102 remain to be issued. Maryland has taken delegation from the EPA for inspecting and enforcing against those major MACT sources for which EPA has promulgated standards to date. When the EPA issues additional standards, the Department will seek to include them under its delegation as well. The EPA has also promulgated MACT standards for several minor source categories. The Department is inspecting all minor MACT sources and has issued a proposed regulation to provide enforcement authority in this regard. Once the proposed regulation is final, the EPA will grant Maryland delegation of authority. As in the case for major MACT sources, the Department will seek to add additional MACT standards to its delegation authority for minor sources as additional standards are issued by the EPA. Region III is committed to reviewing MDE draft new source and Clean Air Act Title V operating permits and provide any appropriate comments and/or issues during the review cycle in a timely   manner. This may include providing assistance to MDE such as defining Best Available Control Technology requirements, conducting air quality impact modeling reviews, and other associated permit matters.

Objective #2  Beginning in the 2000 ozone season ensure that NOx Budget Rule sources in Maryland comply with the NOx emission/allowance requirements in the Rule and the consent orders arising from the Rule, as applicable. Objective #3  Beginning in the 2003 ozone season ensure that NOx SIP Call sources in Maryland do not emit in excess of 14,600 tons of NOx emissions during the ozone season. Objective #4 Achieve attainment with the one-hour ozone standard by 2005 in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas and Cecil County. Objective #5  Implement the federal MACT program for those major MACT sources for which standards have been issued by the EPA and beginning no later than January 1, 2001 implement the federal MACT program for those minor sources for which MACT standards have been issued by the EPA. Objective #6  Implement existing state programs to measure and control the emissions of toxic air pollutants. Objective #7  Implement existing programs to prevent the public from being exposed to asbestos. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 Ozone The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require Maryland to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within the deadlines established in the Act. The only NAAQS for which Maryland still has nonattainment areas is ozone. The Act requires Maryland to demonstrate attainment for ozone by 1999 in the Washington, D.C. region and 2005 in the Baltimore region and Cecil County (part of the Philadelphia nonattainment area). As noted earlier, a compliance-date extension to 2005 has been granted for the Washington metropolitan area. In general in FY01, Maryland will concentrate its efforts on developing the 1999 emissions inventory, implementing existing control strategies to continue to reduce ozone precursor emissions, and developing additional control strategies to eliminate the 13 ton shortfall in Maryland's attainment demonstration. Air Toxics State air toxics regulations require new sources of toxic air pollutants to install Best Available   Control Technology for toxics. Both new and existing sources must demonstrate that their air toxic emissions will not or do not unreasonably endanger human health. The Act establishes requirements for sources of hazardous air pollutants, including Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). Maryland currently has delegation from EPA to implement and enforce the NESHAP standards and the MACT standards as they apply to major sources. Maryland is seeking delegation of authority for the MACT standards as they apply to area sources. Delegation is expected in early FY01. Irrespective of delegation status, inspection of major and minor MACT sources is currently being undertaken and will continue. Acid Rain The Act established stringent emission limitations for utilities with reductions to be achieved in two phases. EPA was responsible for issuing Phase I permits and the states were to issue Phase II permits. As of May 1998, MDE has issued all of the required Phase II permits which have an effective date of January 1, 2000. The permits require the affected sources to comply with all the requirements of the federal acid rain regulations and to hold allowances equal to or greater than the allowances allocated by regulation. As an ongoing activity, which will continue unabated, MDE staff has served as field inspectors for EPA's Acid Rain Program to observe quality assurance testing and to audit the required continuous emission monitoring systems at sources in the Program. Ozone, Air Toxics Control and Acid Rain (The following includes commitments on behalf of both MDE and Region III in addressing major program activities listed below.) q  MDE will participate in 8-hour ozone attainment/nonattainment area boundary discussions with EPA following their review of Maryland's recommendations in this regard. Once agreement is reached between Region III and MDE on the 8-hour ozone area boundary designations. Region III will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions on Maryland's submission. Implement Maryland's NOx Budget Rule limiting NOx emissions from affected utilities and large industrial boilers. As previously mentioned, Region III is in the process of evaluating MDE's N0x Budget Rule submission and will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions. MDE will participate in efforts to develop regional control measures to further reduce ozone precursor emissions from sources within the Baltimore metropolitan area. As previously mentioned, Region III will also assist in identifying additional control strategies and measures to further reduce ozone precursor emissions, from stationary, mobile and area sources in the Baltimore metropolitan area. MDE will continue to prepare the 1999 VOC and N0x emissions inventory. Region III will provide any necessary support in this effort as well as conduct inventory completeness reviews and provide comments, as warranted. MDE will develop and implement a banking and trading program for VOC and NOx emission offset credits. Region III will provide any appropriate comments and assistance on Maryland's banking and trading program. MDE will implement the delegated federal air toxics program for major NESHAP MACT sources and accept delegation of EPA's authority upon promulgation of a state regulation providing authority for enforcing the NESHAP MACT requirements at area sources. Region III will assist MDE in its efforts to implement the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), including support for developing air toxics inventories. MDE will implement outreach efforts for voluntary action to reduce emissions on high ozone days. Region III is committed to promoting voluntary programs to reduce ozone precursor emissions, including such energy efficient programs as Energy Star Buildings and Homes,  q  q  q  q  q  q   etc. q  MDE will revise the mobile source budget for the Baltimore area and Cecil County to include federal Tier 2 car and light truck emission standards and to process this revision as an amendment to the State Implementation Plan. Region III will provide any requested technical assistance to MDE in these efforts and, upon receipt of this proposed revision to the Maryland State Implementation Plan, will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions. Maryland will continue to implement enhanced Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program requirements and the emission repair technician certification program. MDE commits to maintaining a statewide air monitoring network, including monitoring for fine particulate matter and air toxics, and install and operate speciation monitors for fine particulate matter at four sites. Region III will, to the extent possible, provide as much early communication as soon as possible on what monitoring commitments will be proposed each year in the grant narrative and subsequent award(s). This will allow MDE to efficiently and effectively prepare to meet any new grant commitments that may arise. In addition, Region III will provide MDE written confirmation of any statements made or agreements reached that affect the use, management, or availability of grant funds in the area of air quality monitoring. MDE will increase the public's understanding and use and benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. MDE will issue new source permits for major sources to construct and modify and state Clean Air Act Title V permits to operate containing conditions adequate to ensure compliance with air pollution control requirements, including appropriate toxic air pollution controls. Region III, upon receipt of draft permits from MDE, review and provide appropriate comments in a timely manner. Where major issues arise during the course of permit reviews by Region III, Region III promptly notify MDE of the issue(s) either verbally or in writing, so as to begin a dialog at the earliest possible time to resolve the issue(s). MDE will perform routine inspections of regulated facilities in Maryland and respond to citizen complaints about air pollution. MDE will conduct inspections of Stage II facilities. MDE will take appropriate enforcement actions in cases of non-compliance. MDE will continue working with EPA on Acid Rain Program activities. Region III will coordinate with Maryland agencies, other federal agencies and the public-at-large on voluntary programs such as Energy Star Buildings and Homes, Green Lights, etc., and other energy conservation measures to reduce acid rain precursor emissions. Maryland will implement its diesel smoke testing/repair program (effective July 2000). MDE will finalize Maryland's air toxics inventory, which includes emission estimates for area, mobile and stationary sources. Region III will provide and appropriate technical assistance in this endeavor. Region III will also commit to the following to enhance communications and to assure timely responses to MDE's program activities: - Communicate with MDE's Planning Program monthly to provide as much forewarning as possible on any new or changes to existing deadlines established by EPA relative to SIP submittals, SIP commitments and other SIP-related matters.  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q   - Evaluate State land use strategies for potential air quality benefits in line with EPA policies and provide guidance as necessary in this regard. Asbestos State law establishes licensing requirements for business entities and public units that engage in asbestos removal or encapsulation and accreditation requirements for individuals engaged in certain asbestos occupations involving schools and public buildings. State and federal regulations also establish procedures for the removal and disposal of asbestos materials. A Governor's Executive Order established the Asbestos Oversight Committee (AOC), which addresses imminent health hazards from asbestos in State-owned buildings and ensures proper training for State employees involved in asbestos-related work. The Secretary of MDE serves as the Chairperson of the AOC and ARMA provides staff support. q  Issue asbestos removal licenses and asbestos occupation accreditation to qualified business entities, public units, and individuals. Perform inspections of asbestos removal and/or encapsulation projects in Maryland. Conduct enforcement actions as appropriate. Audit training courses to ensure adequacy of asbestos-related training. Provide training to State employees in asbestos-related work. Provide technical support and assist the AOC in establishing priorities for asbestos abatement in State-owned buildings.  q  q  q  q  q  Natural Wood Waste Natural wood waste poses the potential for difficult to extinguish fires with resultant adverse and noxious air quality impacts. Fires at natural wood waste facilities can pollute the air and affect the health, comfort, and safety of all Maryland residents. To reduce the occurrence of nuisance conditions, health impacts, and air pollution created by smoke from these fires, MDE implements controls through a permitting and enforcement program. These activities include requirements to prevent and minimize fires through effective planning of sire operations and contingency plans, compliance activities to implement these plans, and enforcement activities to penalize those responsible when poor management practices have allowed a fire to occur or worsen. Facilities that manage natural wood waste must comply with the State natural wood waste regulations and operators must obtain a natural wood waste recycling facility permit. The regulations and permits prescribe requirements for fire control and other preventive measures. In FY 2001, MDE is undertaking the following management strategies: q  Continue coordination with the State Fire Marshal's Office to ensure that plans for natural wood waste facilities meet applicable fire prevention standards and have adequate provisions for fighting fires should they occur, and Emphasize fire prevention activities in inspections of unpermitted natural wood waste recycling facilities and prioritize enforcement and cleanup activities at facilities that lack fire prevention and controls. Back to Top  q   RESOURCE DISCUSSION Air Programs In terms of staffing, the single most pressing problem is that of staff turnover. The Planning and Permit programs have suffered the most in this regard. The Planning Program has decreased the number of vacancies it has had over the past twelve months, but a few key vacancies remain, and for the positions that were newly filled it will take some time before performance within those positions match what existed previously. This, coupled with the amount of work needed to be done over the next twelve months in the area of developing regional control measures, preparing the 1999 inventory, updating conformity budgets and developing attainment area boundaries for an eight-hour ozone standard, will present a significant challenge for the Planning Program. Outsourcing of modeling activities to the University of Maryland occurs, and has been occurring for several years. This is expected to continue, as the expertise does not exist in-house. Outsourcing of some inventory work to a contractor has taken place to supplement the efforts of existing staff. More outsourcing may be done in the future. An additional staff position was approved in the FY01 budget for PM-fine activities. As part of its grant commitment with the EPA, the Planning Program performs analyses on ambient air quality data from PAMS monitoring stations in an effort to determine pollutant trends and various data corollaries, such as the relationship between ozone levels and source emissions. Due to data gaps and the short-term nature of some data, these analyses can yield weak conclusions on occasion. Additional, stronger analyses need to be performed at times to provide information that would be more useful in the future in making decisions regarding cost-effective pollution control strategies. Also, there is a need to analyze the data to determine whether any logical reductions in data gathering can occur, such as ceasing to collect ozone data during evening hours when ozone levels are generally non-problematic. These additional analyses require substantial commitment of resources. Regional efforts, where broader and higher volumes of information are available, and the use of outside contractors to examine these data offer the best hope in this regard. Regional bodies, such as NESCAUM and MARAMA, are beginning to examine data on a multi-state scale through the use of outside contractors. More examinations of the data are needed, and the Department encourages the EPA to support such efforts. The Permit Program has several vacancies and has had difficulty filling them in recent times, which is making it difficult to keep up with the workload or to conduct special initiatives, like additional general permits. A lack of sufficient candidates, possibly owing to state pay rates versus those the private sector can offer, has been an issue. Even when candidates are available and offers of employment are eventually made, the person offered employment often declines due to having received a better offer elsewhere. To improve the chances of attracting good candidates, outreach to colleges has been increased and the method of announcing job openings has been broadened. As a stopgap measure, an employee from the Compliance Program has been assigned to the Permits Program to draft permits until staffing levels improve. Also, the services of an outside contractor has been used since February 2000 to help draft 12 Title V permits. The effort will be extended in FY01. Staff is also devoting overtime hours to the drafting of Title V permits. Despite these efforts, the Permits Program is behind in issuing Title V permits and will not meet EPA's goal of having all Title V permits issued by January 1, 2001. Two additional staff engineering positions were approved into the FY01 budget to assist in the Title V effort. These two positions, when filled and after training takes place, will provide a benefit to the program in the latter part of 2001. A third position, a contractual secretary, is being sought through an amendment to the FY01 budget. This too should help improve matters. The delay in issuing Title V permits can not be totally attributed to staffing issues, as there are other factors at play, such as State Implementation Plan deficiencies and the time-consuming need to provide assistance to permit applicants on several very large projects needing construction permits. Effort is underway to develop a plan and a schedule for addressing State Implementation Plan deficiencies, which will allow those permits that are currently unable to be issued to subsequently be issued. Correcting the Plan deficiencies may not be fully complete until the spring of 2001, which means that the ensuing permit issuances will continue into FY02. As part of the 105 grant activities, the Department is conducting inspections at area MACT sources. Dry-cleaning establishments represent the largest source category, with over 500 known   individual sources in Maryland. Twenty percent of these sources will be inspected over the next five years (2/00-2/05) and will be done so by staff within the Compliance Program. In order to accomplish the additional task of inspecting dry-cleaning operations, certain facilities inspected by these staff on a yearly basis in the past will now be inspected every other year or every third year depending on the nature of the facility. A recent change in the area of Stage II inspections will also have an impact on resources. As of July 1, 2000, ARMA is inspecting the 1,500 Stage II facilities in the major metropolitan areas of Maryland. Prior to this, such inspections were conducted by the Department's Waste Management Administration (WAS) in conjunction with their oil operations activities. Due to a change in priorities within WAS, it was mutually agreed that the inspection duties would transfer over to ARMA at the beginning of FY01. One additional staff person has been hired for this effort for a six-month period (which has just expired) and two additional full-time staff positions are being sought (FY01 contractual authorization budget amendment is pending). Until the requested new staff positions are approved and filled, existing Compliance Program staff are performing the inspections. As such, and similar to what is occurring relative to minor MACT sources, further adjustments have been made in the inspection schedules for the universe of non-Stage II facilities normally inspected by the Compliance Program each year. Maryland is to add four PM-fine speciation samplers to its monitoring network in the latter part of 2000. Based on issues that arose with the installation of the more basic PM-fine monitors, it is estimated that operation will commence in 2001. During the first year of the stations' operation, they will be attended to by the University of Maryland and samples will be analyzed by the EPA at a lab in North Carolina. After the first year, the Department will take over the effort. Consideration will need to be given in the FY03 budget to addressing this need, both in terms of positions and funds. A position was added to the FY01 budget to address insufficient staffing levels in the area of quality assurance/quality control of PM-fine sampling data. An assessment will need to be made in FY01 and FY02 as to whether two (one new, one existing) positions are adequate for all QA/QC activities. Natural Wood Waste The natural wood waste recycling program is not specifically funded. Resources from other generalfunded programs are necessary to provide needed activities associated with this program. Functions that are not being adequately performed include responding to increasing numbers of complaints involving natural wood waste recycling facilities. Additional inspectors are needed to provide faster response times on complaints and increase the numbers of natural wood waste recycling facility inspectors. Increased compliance rates could be expected as a result. Back to Top  DATA DISCUSSION Air Programs In terms of meeting the overall goal of providing clean air, much of the data used throughout this document would give the appearance that not much is changing for the better: the number of people living in an ozone nonattainment area has not decreased from year to year, the number of ozone exceedance days is not declining significantly and Maryland's performance compared to other states in the Ozone Transport Region is relatively poor. There is an indication, however, that control programs may be working based on how Maryland is avoiding an ozone exceedance when the air temperature exceeds 90 degrees. Also, the 1990-1996 downward trend for ozone precursor emissions and the major NOx reduction programs and motor vehicle-related improvement measures that have recently been implemented and are on the horizon are further indications that progress is being made.   What is not shown by the current data that has been used to date is the effect ozone transport can have on Maryland's air quality. Currently, one of the principal indicators for whether air quality is improving  that of ozone exceedance days - only shows whether the ozone standard was exceeded. No information is provided to show whether an exceedance may be related to a large degree to ozone being transported into Maryland, which would be helpful to know for long-term planning purposes. To attempt to rectify this deficiency, the Department will begin to evaluate practical approaches to measuring and displaying levels of transported ozone from areas west and southwest of Maryland. Reviewing data from the Shenandoah Park monitoring station, from other monitors not influenced by ozone generated in the Baltimore area and the Washington suburbs and from available upper atmosphere measurements and drawing some correlations between these data and the daily ground-level ozone concentrations is a possible option in this regard. A second deficiency relative to the current data used is that the degree and the pervasiveness of an ozone exceedance are not made evident. Information exists to show whether an ozone exceedance is limited to a single area of the State or whether an exceedance blanketed the entire metropolitan region. Information also exists to show the degree to which the standard was exceeded (maximum value above the standard). Knowing the amount by which an exceedance is above the standard would be useful to know for health concerns purposes, especially if any longterm trend towards very high levels starts to develop. A review of the past data will be undertaken in 2000 to see if it is possible to chart the information mentioned above in a manner that is easily presented and useful to concerned parties. In FY00, the Department began posting on its web site the annual air monitoring report. This report is a summary of air monitoring data, including that for air toxics, collected over the course of the previous calendar year. This effort will continue in the future. The air programs collect emissions data from stationary sources within the State. These data are compiled into an emissions inventory, which serves as the basis for all planning and modeling efforts, as well as a resource for the permit and compliance staffs. The emissions data currently reside in flat file format on an IBM mainframe computer at the Annapolis Data Center. The Department intends to move these data to a PC server in database format, as funds are available. A PC-based system would make correlation between the permit system and the registration database much easier than the current hard copy approach. The initial step to evaluate the tasks and the difficulty level of those tasks to make the conversion is scheduled to occur in FY01 using $100,000 in budgeted funds.

Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution  MDE GOAL #2: ENSURING THAT MARYLANDERS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO UNNECESSARY LEVELS OF RADIATION Under both federal and state law, MDE is charged with ensuring that the public is protected from unnecessary levels of radiation. As such, MDE's major focus is on preventing exposures to radiation. The key areas of emphasis described below relate to (1) licensing and inspecting users of radioactive materials; (2) registering, certifying and inspecting radiation machines, and (3) responses to emergencies involving radioactive materials and transportation activities or nuclear power plant operations. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  X-Ray The number of x-ray machines has been increasing in Maryland at a state of 9-10% per year, creating a corresponding need to increase the number of inspections. Through the end of the second quarter of FY 19999, the X-Ray Division inspection staff did not keep pace with the growth in facility registrations. This resulted in a steadily increasing backlog and a relatively low rate for enforcement actions resolved, particularly for dental and veterinary facilities, which are inspected every 3 years. A major reason for the low rate of resolution of enforcement actions has been the lack of follow-up by inspectors. This has been due in part because of the focus on completing a certain number of inspections and in part because of the high vacancy rate for much of the fiscal year in the X-Ray Division. Those vacancies were filled halfway through the fiscal year, but several months were then necessary for formal and in-house training of the new inspectors. The X-Ray Division's productivity has improved substantially. The Department anticipates that, with a full complement of trained inspectors, the x-ray unit's ability to follow-up and resolve violations will be enhanced in FY 2000. In addition, continued vigilance in acquiring experienced health physicists to fill vacancies and implementing efficient and effective management procedures under the direction of a newly hired division chief, are expected to result in significant improvements in all x-ray performance categories in FY 2000. Another performance measure on which the Department intends to focus more attention is the very poor rate of compliance that has been found among dental x-ray machines. This measure reflects the fact that Department inspectors find significant violations of regulations in the majority of dental facilities that they inspect. These violations include excessive accuracy errors in the equipment, failure to change developing solutions at the proper frequency, and underdeveloped film. Violations of this type normally result in increased patient exposure and represent serious lapses in radiation safety practiced by the violating facility. The poor compliance rate is especially troubling because the facilities are always given notice of the inspection in order to avoid disruption of patient services. The Department will address the compliance rate issue through enhanced enforcement of these types of violations.   III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance  Radioactive Materials The Department's radioactive materials licensing and inspection activities are carried out under an agreement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), whereby the NRC's authority with respect to certain types of radioactive materials is transferred to the State and the State program operates in lieu of the federal. The State currently licenses approximately 1000 radioactive materials facilities under this authority. This number has been increasing slightly each year. Inspections of these facilities range from once per year to once every five years, depending on the potential hazard of the radioactive materials activities and the enforcement history of the facility. Maryland's radioactive materials licensing and inspection program is subject to review by the NRC. In order to maintain its Agreement status with the NRC, Maryland's program must be found to be adequate to protect the state health and safety and compatible with the NRC's regulatory program. The determinations of adequacy and compatibility are made following periodic reviews of the State's program by the NRC. These evaluations are called ""Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program"" (IMPEP) reviews and are conducted by a team consisting of NRC staff and at least one agreement state member. An IMPEP review of Maryland's program was conducted during March 1999 concluded that Maryland's program is both adequate and compatible. This review is the first one in more than 20 years in which Maryland's program has been found to be both adequate and compatible. In order to be determined to be compatible, a state must adopt federal requirements within 3 years from promulgation by the NRC. During the past review period, the Department has made a concerted effort to be more timely in its adoption of the federal requirements and has succeeded in eliminating the backlog and in finally achieving compatibility with the NRC program. Although the IMPEP review found the Maryland program overall to be adequate to protect public health and safety, there were two specific areas in which the review team found the program to be satisfactory, but with need for improvement. Those two areas were the technical quality of licensing and the sealed source and device evaluation program. The IMPEP team comments are being addressed by the Department through internal reorganization to establish a radioactive materials licensing section head to provide closer supervision of licensing actions and reassignment of another position to the licensing section. The Department is also considering using a consulting service contract to assist in the mechanical analysis of sealed source and device applications.  Back to Top  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  FY 2001 There are two key management objectives under this goal. They are:   Environmental and Administrative Operations  Objective 2.1 To implement the radioactive materials licensing and inspection, and radiation machines registration, certification and inspection programs so as to ensure that the public is protected from unnecessary radiation; and, Objective 2.2 To respond rapidly and effectively to accidents/incidents involving nuclear material including nuclear power plant events. Back to Top  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provides for the licensing and control of the use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and authorizes the NRC to enter into agreements with the states to transfer part of this authority to states so that the state has complete regulatory control over licensees. Maryland is one of 31 Agreement States that have entered into such an agreement as provided in Section 274 of the Act. Maryland became an Agreement State in 1971. Regulations adopted under Title 8 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, are found in COMAR 26.12, Radiation Management. These regulations contain requirements and procedures for the licensing, use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials and the registration and operation of electronic devices that produce radiation. These regulations also specify the qualifications and procedures for the licensing of qualified health physicists to inspect certain radiation machines as part of Maryland's certification program. To implement these laws, MDE is undertaking the following activities. q  q q  q q  APPENDIX q  State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  q  q q  q  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA  q  License and inspect users of radioactive materials to ensure compliance with license conditions imposed by the State and State regulations that are consistent with the Agreement State compatibility requirement with the NRC.

If requested, EPA Region III will participate in Maryland Emergency radiation response exercises, as well as respond to any calls or requests involving actual or potential releases of radiation; and Require municipal and commercial medical waste incinerators to monitor for radioactive materials in incoming waste streams, and to manage regulated radioactive materials appropriately. Back to Top   RESOURCE DISCUSSION Increasing workload brought on by increases in the number of regulated facilities and enforcement pressures have stressed the staff resources in the Radiological Health Program in both the x-ray and radioactive materials areas. In radioactive materials, in particular, one facility with substantial compliance problems has required numerous hours of staff time to prepare for and participate in several simultaneous enforcement actions, including a major court case. Personnel within the program have multiple responsibilities and the need to devote significant amounts of time to one facility necessarily detracts from other duties. The same is true in the x-ray program where an increased emphasis on compliance could affect the number of inspections that can be completed. An additional factor that contributes to the Department's being able to achieve its goals is the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. Technological advances in the fields of radiography, teletherapy, mammography, dentistry, etc. dictate the need for high level and continuous training of the licensing and inspection staff. The Department has found it increasingly difficult to fill positions with qualified people when vacancies occur and the learning curve before those newly hired individuals are productive is becoming increasingly long. The x-ray program, in particular, has suffered from chronic vacancies in inspector positions. That program now has a full complement of inspectors. The Department will continue its evaluation of this program throughout FY 2000 to determine the adequacy of the staffing level. Funding for the Radiological Health Program comes from a combination of general funds and special funds. Special funds come from the Radiation Control Fund, which consists of license, certification, and registration fees and penalties. A small amount of support is provided for inspection of mammography machines under a contract with the Food and Drug Administration. With the exception of dental facilities, fees were recently raised to more closely reflect the costs associated with administering the license programs. Fees for dental facilities are capped by statute and may not be raised without a statutory change. Current funding should support the existing level of effort for the programs. DATA DISCUSSION The Radiological Health Program currently maintains its licensing and compliance databases using Paradox software. The Department intends to convert these databases into the Department's planned enterprise system. Initial steps for this conversion were scheduled to begin in FY 2000.

Authority  MDE GOAL #3: ENSURING SAFE DRINKING WATER Under federal and state laws and regulations, MDE is responsible for ensuring that all public drinking water systems throughout Maryland meet strict drinking water quality standards. Public drinking water system serves at least fifteen service connections or regularly serves at least twenty-five individuals. Public drinking water system serve approximately 4.3 million Marylanders, or about 84% of the total population of the State, (based on 5.1 million) so it essential that our groundwater and surface water resources are protected. Private wells serve fewer than twenty-five individuals on a regular basis. The wells may serve one home, or be shared by a few homes or businesses. Individual wells, which serve one lot or home, are regulated by local governments through delegation from MDE. Key areas of emphasis for ensuring safe drinking water include implementing various programs to protect: 1) public drinking water supplies, (1A) source water protection and (1B) groundwater, and other programs such as 2) oil pollution prevention, and 3) solid waste management. Also, in its FY2001 management strategies and actions plans, MDE is addressing the emerging issue of contamination from Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in public drinking water supplies and private wells. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  IV. Scope of the Agreement V. Guiding Principles for Protecting Maryland's Citizens and Natural Resources VI. Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002  Source Water Protection Unsafe drinking water can have immediate consequences of widespread diseases, sickness, and even death to vulnerable members of our communities. Long term exposure to other contaminants at unsafe levels may increase the occurrence of cancer. High levels of lead in water can increase blood lead levels. Maryland has experienced no waterborne disease outbreaks attributable to unsafe water in recent years. However, more stringent federal standards have created the current situation in which many individual public systems must upgrade their treatment process and operations in order to be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. The number of new systems that are regulated has grown by over 200 water systems in FY 1999 versus a normal annual increase of approximately 50 systems. The increase in regulated systems results in a comparable increase in violations and enforcement actions. The compliance rate for public water systems in significant compliance has gradually increased over the past few years. A large percentage of Maryland's smaller public water systems (e.g., restaurants and campgrounds) are regulated by county environmental health departments. In FY 1999 Maryland made significant progress in achieving more uniform oversight of these systems by initiating new delegation agreements with standard operating procedures with corresponding funding to county health departments. Groundwater The groundwater discharge permits (industrial and municipal) portion of this goal reflects an increase in the number of inspections conducted during FY 1999 and the associated enforcement actions also indicate a slight increase. The compliance rate for groundwater discharge permits remains at 97%.   New Initiatives  Private Drinking Water Supplies CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting  While the number of individual wells drilled during FY 1999 remained relatively constant compared to prior years, it is possible that the projected drought conditions during summer of 1999 (FY 2000) may result in a significant increase in the need for new wells to be drilled. Oil Pollution Prevention Oil pollution resulting from unlawful spills, discharges or leaking storage tanks can cause groundwater and surface water contamination, which, in turn, could impact public health through drinking water supplies. Housing and economic development can decline in areas that become contaminated from oil due to the reduced value of real estate and perceived or real contamination. Under Maryland Law and regulation (and as provided by Subtitle I of RCRA for Underground Storage Tanks), MDE is responsible for regulating all oil-related activities, including aboveground and underground oil storage facilities, oil-contaminated soil treatment facilities, and oil transportation and for overseeing remediation activities at sites where petroleum products have been discharged. In addition, MDE oversees the installation, maintenance, operation and removal of underground storage tanks (UST's) and investigates complaints of illegal dumping and improper handling of oil. Through MDE's compliance and remediation activities, the use of substandard oil storage systems is reduced, oil storage systems are upgraded with pollution prevention devices, and cleanups of sites impacted by oil are expedited. The prevention of oil releases reduces the public's exposure to contaminated drinking water supplies and reduces the need for costly site cleanups. MDE's strengths include our ability to work with site-specific conditions and to provide direct oversight to responsible parties. Our cooperative working relationship with industry, tank owners, and the public enhances our ability to accomplish this goal. A potential weakness in accomplishing our goal is the availability of public and private funding. The ability of responsible parties to fund cleanups and availability of State budget resources to fund MDE oversight, inspections, and state lead activities directly impact the activities needed to accomplish this goal. In FY2000, the Oil Control program continued to direct resources to respond to the impact of the 1998 UST upgrade deadline. These efforts focused on ensuring that tanks taken out of service rather than upgraded where property taken out of service and subsequently removed from the ground or abandoned in place. In addition, the removal activity generated additional confirmed releases into the environment, which increased the total active leaking underground storage tank sites requiring direct oversight. The Oil Control Program has several new challenges, which may delay continued progress toward reaching prescribed targets. The expected drop off in new releases anticipated following the 1998 deadline has yet to occur. The number of releases from existing heating fuel storage tanks which are not subject to the 1998 deadline have averaged over 400 new releases over the last three years. The number of domestic wells impacted by MTBE stands at 228 as of April 2000, and continues to rise. Defining the extent of the MTBE problem is a major priority and is further discussed in the Management Strategies and Action Plans section. New legislation also expanded the eligibility criteria for cleanup reimbursement funds to cover releases of heating fuel form both commercial and residential heating fuel tanks, both above and underground. Even with these new challenges, there has been progress in several areas as described below: q  As of May 2000, Maryland's compliance with the 1998 upgrade requirements reached 89.3%, and through a compliance assistance review project it has been determined that the remaining systems not declared compliant are either scheduled for proper closure or the   Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  q  q  database record has the system incorrectly listed as out of compliance. The Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund has assisted responsible parties in accomplishing clean-ups of old, leaking UST's. Over 121 applications were approved with UST owners having been reimbursed a total of $6,958,513. Until loan closure deadline of December 31, 1998, 97 low-interest loans from the UST Upgrade and Replacement Fund provided approximately $5 million to tank owners to assist them in meeting the 1998 EPA requirements requiring UST's to be protected from corrosion and have overfill/spill prevention installed.  Solid Waste Management Under State law and in accordance with Subtitle D of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of municipal solid waste facilities in the State. The Solid Waste Program strives to protect public health and the environment from the adverse impacts that solid waste can have on drinking water supplies by ensuring that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. The impacts caused by poor waste disposal practices include: q q  pollution of groundwater which many Marylanders rely on for drinking water supplies; and pollution of surface water, with the potential for impacting drinking supplies including many of the larger municipalities in Maryland (e.g., Baltimore City).  Polluted water resources affect public health and safety; restrict development and growth, and have adverse economic impacts on Maryland. To reduce the risk of health impacts, water pollution, and nuisance conditions that can be created by solid waste facilities, MDE implements controls to minimize the release of pollutants from these facilities through a permitting and enforcement program. MDE's solid waste management activities include issuing permits for the State's 21 municipal landfills, performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure that solid wastes are managed properly, and ensuring that closed landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30year post closure period. Before a landfill permit is issued, the proposed site of the landfill is subject to a comprehensive assessment that encompasses a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines. The program requires the incorporation of effective pollution prevention and control systems into site designs, planning for site operations, contingency plans, and monitoring systems and conducts inspections to ensure these systems are in place and functioning properly. Other State and local agencies are involved early in the permit review process to ensure that all environmental and regulatory requirements are met. The environmental performance of landfills is assessed through MDE's review of groundwater monitoring data, soil gas monitoring data, and surface water monitoring data. The Solid Waste Program is in the process of redrafting solid waste regulations to accommodate federal requirements. As the federal regulations governing municipal landfills came into being after the current state regulations were developed, some of our requirements are out-of-date. Changing our regulations will give us the opportunity to streamline and update our requirements to include recent changes in State law. MDE's solid waste management strategies have been consistently applied over many years, and have demonstrated major improvements which are obvious when contrasting the waste disposal in Maryland in 1980, and even 1990, with the situation today. For example, there are fewer active municipal landfills, but more active rubble landfills and other types of facilities, than there were 10 or 20 years ago. However, the older, inactive facilities still exist, and require monitoring and inspection. As communities expand to include areas that were previously largely undeveloped, homes and businesses are being sited much nearer to these older landfills. Program responsibility for monitoring and ensuring proper groundwater remediation at these facilities will continue for many years.

Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and nontidal rivers   Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  the Program's workload, including case tracking, has improved our performance by identifying areas in which we are being successful, the areas where we have weaknesses, and the causes of those weaknesses. Additional staffing is needed for the review of landfill groundwater monitoring data and for gathering technical information concerning old landfill sites to answer many inquiries received. Staff turnover has also reduced performance in this area. In FY 2000, all but one of the operating municipal waste landfills in the State were in compliance with groundwater standards (e.g., have no significant release, or if a release has been identified, a remedial plan has been approved by MDE). All operating municipal solid waste landfills are now equipped with liners and leachate collection systems to prevent the migration of landfill contaminants from entering surface and groundwaters. MDE implemented regulations that require liners and leachate collection systems in all operating rubble landfills by July 2001, or they must close. The regulated community is midway to the goal of shifting to the use of lined rubble landfills and it is anticipated that this deadline will be met. Several currently operating rubble landfills have decided to close rather than comply with the liner and leachate collection system requirements. Other trends included the following:  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  q  Over 100 investigations of solid waste complaints from citizens and other stakeholders were conducted. The number and percentage of groundwater monitoring reports for landfills reviewed decreased due to staff shortages and turnover. This is an area of strategic weakness, which needs to be addressed. The number of compliance assistance events for solid waste activities increased due to greater staff familiarity with the need and methods for collection of compliance assistance data and improved information capture techniques.  q  q  GOAL PERFORMANCE DATA Unsafe drinking water can have immediate consequences of widespread diseases, sickness, and even death to vulnerable members of our communities. Long term exposure to other contaminants at unsafe levels may increase the occurrence of cancer. High levels of lead in water can increase blood lead levels. Maryland has experienced no waterborne disease outbreaks attributable to unsafe water in recent years. However, more stringent federal standards have created the current situation in which many individual public systems must upgrade their treatment process and operations in order to be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. The number of new systems that are regulated has grown by over 200 water systems in FY 1999 versus a normal annual increase of approximately 50 systems. The increase in regulated systems results in a comparable increase in violations and enforcement actions. The compliance rate for public water systems in significant compliance has gradually increased over the past few years. A large percentage of Maryland's smaller public water systems (e.g., restaurants and campgrounds) are regulated by county environmental health departments. In FY 1999 Maryland made significant progress in achieving more uniform oversight of these systems by initiating new delegation agreements with standard operating procedures with corresponding funding to county health departments. Groundwater The groundwater discharge permits (industrial and municipal) portion of this goal reflects an increase in the number of inspections conducted during FY 1999 and the associated enforcement actions also indicate a slight increase. The compliance rate for groundwater discharge permits remains at 97%.  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   Private Drinking Water Supplies While the number of individual wells drilled during FY 1999 remained relatively constant compared to prior years, it is possible that the projected drought conditions during summer of 1999 (FY 2000) may result in a significant increase in the need for new wells to be drilled. Oil Pollution Prevention Oil pollution resulting from unlawful spills, discharges or leaking storage tanks can cause groundwater and surface water contamination, which, in turn, could impact public health through drinking water supplies. Housing and economic development can decline in areas that become contaminated from oil due to the reduced value of real estate and perceived or real contamination. Under Maryland Law and regulation (and as provided by Subtitle I of RCRA for Underground Storage Tanks), MDE is responsible for regulating all oil-related activities, including aboveground and underground oil storage facilities, oil-contaminated soil treatment facilities, and oil transportation and for overseeing remediation activities at sites where petroleum products have been discharged. In addition, MDE oversees the installation, maintenance, operation and removal of underground storage tanks (UST's) and investigates complaints of illegal dumping and improper handling of oil. Through MDE's compliance and remediation activities, the use of substandard oil storage systems is reduced, oil storage systems are upgraded with pollution prevention devices, and cleanups of sites impacted by oil are expedited. The prevention of oil releases reduces the public's exposure to contaminated drinking water supplies and reduces the need for costly site cleanups. MDE's strengths include our ability to work with site-specific conditions and to provide direct oversight to responsible parties. Our cooperative working relationship with industry, tank owners, and the public enhances our ability to accomplish this goal. A potential weakness in accomplishing our goal is the availability of public and private funding. The ability of responsible parties to fund cleanups and availability of State budget resources to fund MDE oversight, inspections, and state lead activities directly impact the activities needed to accomplish this goal. In FY2000, the Oil Control program continued to direct resources to respond to the impact of the 1998 UST upgrade deadline. These efforts focused on ensuring that tanks taken out of service rather than upgraded where property taken out of service and subsequently removed from the ground or abandoned in place. In addition, the removal activity generated additional confirmed releases into the environment, which increased the total active leaking underground storage tank sites requiring direct oversight. The Oil Control Program has several new challenges, which may delay continued progress toward reaching prescribed targets. The expected drop off in new releases anticipated following the 1998 deadline has yet to occur. The number of releases from existing heating fuel storage tanks which are not subject to the 1998 deadline have averaged over 400 new releases over the last three years. The number of domestic wells impacted by MTBE stands at 228 as of April 2000, and continues to rise. Defining the extent of the MTBE problem is a major priority and is further discussed in the Management Strategies and Action Plans section. New legislation also expanded the eligibility criteria for cleanup reimbursement funds to cover releases of heating fuel form both commercial and residential heating fuel tanks, both above and underground. Even with these new challenges, there has been progress in several areas as described below: q  q  As of May 2000, Maryland's compliance with the 1998 upgrade requirements reached 89.3%, and through a compliance assistance review project it has been determined that the remaining systems not declared compliant are either scheduled for proper closure or the database record has the system incorrectly listed as out of compliance. The Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund has assisted responsible parties in accomplishing clean-ups of old, leaking UST's. Over 121 applications were approved with   q  UST owners having been reimbursed a total of $6,958,513. Until loan closure deadline of December 31, 1998, 97 low-interest loans from the UST Upgrade and Replacement Fund provided approximately $5 million to tank owners to assist them in meeting the 1998 EPA requirements requiring UST's to be protected from corrosion and have overfill/spill prevention installed.  Solid Waste Management Under State law and in accordance with Subtitle D of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of municipal solid waste facilities in the State. The Solid Waste Program strives to protect public health and the environment from the adverse impacts that solid waste can have on drinking water supplies by ensuring that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. The impacts caused by poor waste disposal practices include: q q  pollution of groundwater which many Marylanders rely on for drinking water supplies; and pollution of surface water, with the potential for impacting drinking supplies including many of the larger municipalities in Maryland (e.g., Baltimore City).  Polluted water resources affect public health and safety; restrict development and growth, and have adverse economic impacts on Maryland. To reduce the risk of health impacts, water pollution, and nuisance conditions that can be created by solid waste facilities, MDE implements controls to minimize the release of pollutants from these facilities through a permitting and enforcement program. MDE's solid waste management activities include issuing permits for the State's 21 municipal landfills, performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure that solid wastes are managed properly, and ensuring that closed landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30year post closure period. Before a landfill permit is issued, the proposed site of the landfill is subject to a comprehensive assessment that encompasses a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines. The program requires the incorporation of effective pollution prevention and control systems into site designs, planning for site operations, contingency plans, and monitoring systems and conducts inspections to ensure these systems are in place and functioning properly. Other State and local agencies are involved early in the permit review process to ensure that all environmental and regulatory requirements are met. The environmental performance of landfills is assessed through MDE's review of groundwater monitoring data, soil gas monitoring data, and surface water monitoring data. The Solid Waste Program is in the process of redrafting solid waste regulations to accommodate federal requirements. As the federal regulations governing municipal landfills came into being after the current state regulations were developed, some of our requirements are out-of-date. Changing our regulations will give us the opportunity to streamline and update our requirements to include recent changes in State law. MDE's solid waste management strategies have been consistently applied over many years, and have demonstrated major improvements which are obvious when contrasting the waste disposal in Maryland in 1980, and even 1990, with the situation today. For example, there are fewer active municipal landfills, but more active rubble landfills and other types of facilities, than there were 10 or 20 years ago. However, the older, inactive facilities still exist, and require monitoring and inspection. As communities expand to include areas that were previously largely undeveloped, homes and businesses are being sited much nearer to these older landfills. Program responsibility for monitoring and ensuring proper groundwater remediation at these facilities will continue for many years. The use of technology, particularly the use of computers and advanced software to assist in tracking the Program's workload, including case tracking, has improved our performance by identifying areas in which we are being successful, the areas where we have weaknesses, and the causes of those weaknesses. Additional staffing is needed for the review of landfill groundwater monitoring data and   for gathering technical information concerning old landfill sites to answer many inquiries received. Staff turnover has also reduced performance in this area. In FY 2000, all but one of the operating municipal waste landfills in the State were in compliance with groundwater standards (e.g., have no significant release, or if a release has been identified, a remedial plan has been approved by MDE). All operating municipal solid waste landfills are now equipped with liners and leachate collection systems to prevent the migration of landfill contaminants from entering surface and groundwaters. MDE implemented regulations that require liners and leachate collection systems in all operating rubble landfills by July 2001, or they must close. The regulated community is midway to the goal of shifting to the use of lined rubble landfills and it is anticipated that this deadline will be met. Several currently operating rubble landfills have decided to close rather than comply with the liner and leachate collection system requirements. Other trends included the following: q  Over 100 investigations of solid waste complaints from citizens and other stakeholders were conducted. The number and percentage of groundwater monitoring reports for landfills reviewed decreased due to staff shortages and turnover. This is an area of strategic weakness, which needs to be addressed. The number of compliance assistance events for solid waste activities increased due to greater staff familiarity with the need and methods for collection of compliance assistance data and improved information capture techniques.  q  q  Percent of Marylanders Served by Community Groundwater Systems with Active Wellhead Protection Programs In Place   Marylanders Served by Surface Systems with Source Protection Programs in Place  Back to Top  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  FY 2001  The key management objectives under this goal are: Objective 3.1 To ensure compliance of public water systems with all federal and State requirements; Objective 3.2 To ensure that private wells used by Marylanders comply with state regulations;   Objective 3.3 To prevent pollutant contamination of potable surface waters; Objective 3.4 To fully develop and implement source protection programs for all public drinking water systems that receive water from surface sources; Objective 3.5 To prevent contamination of potable groundwater aquifers that are vulnerable to underground hydrological transport mechanisms; Objective 3.6 To develop locally based wellhead protection programs to ensure long-term viability of supply sources; Objective 3.7 To ensure that municipal landfills operate in significant compliance with all State and federal laws and standards; Objective 3.8 To ensure that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in significant compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements; Objective 3.9 To initiate and complete cleanups of sites impacted by discharge of oil or other hazardous substances; and, Objective 3.10 To manage the State's water resources to ensure adequate quantity for the future. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 Source Water Protection Key activities related to source water protection include developing a source to water protection include developing a source water assessment program that is consistent with the 1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and managing withdrawal of water resources. This requires the delineation of source water assessment areas, identifying potential sources of contaminants, conducting a susceptibility analysis of the source to those contaminants and allocating water usage in Maryland. EPA approved Maryland's Source Water Assessment Program in November 1999. Other strategies include building partnerships with local governments, federal government, agricultural interests, river basin commissions, and neighboring states to implement source water assessment and protection programs, and to conserve water resources in Maryland. Also, enhancing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to allow for comprehensive review of potential contaminant sources with on source water assessment areas. Finally, MDE will administer the State Revolving Fund )SRF) set-aside dollars to fund source water assessment projects, acquisition to sensitive lands and wellhead protection projects. Pollution prevention is a part of the strategy to protect source water. Efforts include land or easement purchases through a loan program, a pilot conservation plan with an education component, and utilization of land use planning tolls like wellhead protection ordinances. EPA will continue to provide support to the SRF financing of non-traditional water quality activities and coordinate SRF programs with Maryland's comprehensive watershed management program and place-based initiatives. Drought   The first meetings of the Advisory Committee on Water Conservation and the technical Committee on Water Supply Infrastructure were held on April 26, 2000 at MDE. The two advisory committees were established by gubernatorial executive order, following last year's drought emergency. They will assist the state in developing and implementing long-term water conservation policies and programs. The Water Conservation Advisory Committee is comprised of members appointed by the Governor to represent state and local government, major water suppliers, environmental interest organizations, business, farming, public education, and the general public. This committee will examine current practices, procedures and policies across Maryland for conserving water supplies, and recommend short and long-term planning which will enhance the state's preparedness and ability to respond to future drought emergencies. Some suggested outcomes include: q q  q  Recommend a statewide Drought Response Action Plan for future droughts. Recommend a new statewide barometer for measuring drought conditions/severity that includes triggers for drought response. Differing drought conditions in geographic regions of the state may necessitate geographic differences in drought responses. Develop a process for granting variances/exceptions. Determine how Maryland's response plan should be coordinate with local drought/emergency response plans, regional agencies (i.e., SRBC, ICPRC, etc.) And neighboring states. The Technical Advisory Committee on Water Supply Infrastructure is comprised of members appointed by the Governor to represent state and local government agencies involved in water supply and resources management, technical experts with planning design and engineering expertise and others with relevant interest and expertise. This committee will study the impact of infrastructure deficiencies on water conservation and recommend and prioritize infrastructure improvements to minimize water loss. Some suggested outcomes include: r  q q  q  r r  r r  Recommend criteria for requiring water utilities to address failing infrastructure (i.e., assessments and improvements to leaking distribution systems within cost-effective guidelines). Recommend policy for interconnection of adjacent water supply systems. Recommend guidance for local utility self-assessments on adequacy of water supply systems to sustain service during periods of drought (i.e., are alternate supplies available, what is the condition and extent of storage, how are supply storage capacities managed to meet average/peak demands and to respond to drought emergencies). Recommend policy for interconnection of adjacent water supply systems. Determine if funding mechanisms are needed.  Treatment System Compliance Treatment system compliance is assured through a variety of activities, including: q q q  q q  q q  On-site technical assistance (e.g., Comprehensive performance Evaluations (CPE's) Sanitary surveys program; Annual solicitation, rating, and ranking of Drinking Water Projects to be considered for funding under the Drinking Water SRF Program./ Provision of financial assistance (e.g., grants and drinking water SRF loans); Capacity Development Assessments to ensure projects targeted for financial assistance have the technical, managerial, and institutional resources for effective operations. Support of operator training; and. Enforcement against water systems that are not insignificant compliance with state and federal standards.  Private Drinking Water Supplies Work with local county health departments to educate the public to identify risks to individual wells   and private well systems from natural or man-made contaminants. Establish criteria for well construction. Oil Control Program In FY 2001, the Oil Control Program will strive to ensure proper data collection and management and target inspections on non-compliant storage systems. In addition, the Program will strive to achieve all Government Performance Review Act (GPRA) goals set EPA grant work-plans including: q q q  Increase the number of clean-ups completed; Achieve 93% of active UST's meeting upgrade goals; and Increase UST's in-compliance with release detection regulations.  In FY 2001, the fee that supports oil related activities in the State was scheduled to be reduced by 33 1/3 percent. However, on May 18, 2000, Governor Glendening signed legislation that eliminated the reduction and raised the current fee from 1.5 cents per barrel to 2 cents per barrel. The bill also added an additional 1 cent per barrel fee to be directed for the next five years to the Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup and Reimbursement Program, the scope of which was expanded to include reimbursements for costs associated with releases from commercial and residential heating fuel tanks. Solid Waste Program In FY2001, the Solid Waste Program will: q  q  Attempt to ensure that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. Act to prevent and control the release of pollutants through the review of proposed disposal site locations, preventive engineering, pollution control technologies, review of construction, illegal site interdiction, and remedial activities.  To implement these strategies, MDE will continue the following: q  q  q q  q  q  q  Notify and seek input from County Health Departments, Natural Resources Conservation Districts, appropriate federal agencies, and other interested programs within MDE on applications for solid waste facilities; Require that regulated facilities be designed and operated with at least the minimum requirements established in regulation for pollution prevention and control; Routinely perform unannounced inspections of refuse disposal and other solid waste facilities. Oversight of operating permits for the State's 25 active municipal landfills and other solid waste facilities; Perform inspections annually to ensure landfills and other solid waste facilities are managed properly; Ensure that closed municipal landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30 year post closure period; and Request funding through a budget initiative for staff for FY 2002 to review landfill groundwater monitoring data, to provide technical customer assistance concerning groundwater and water quality conditions at landfill sites, and to conduct inspections of solid waste facilities.  Emergency Response MDE maintains an Emergency Response Division whose responsibility is to work with local jurisdictions and industries to respond to emergency spills of oil and hazardous substances that endanger drinking water supplies. Details for this program can be found in Goal #4. Methyl tertiary butyl either (MTBE)   Methyl tertiary butyl either (MTBE) is a fuel additive used as an octane enhancer since the early 1970's when lead was being phased out of gasoline. MTBE is used in oxygenated and reformulated gasolines as an air quality control measure. In recent years, MTBE has been found in 5 to 10 percent of public drinking water supplies in the United States. Private wells is also of concern regarding MTBE, although data is lacking. An EPA Blue Ribbon Panel has recommended that the use of MTBE should be substantially reduced because it can contaminate drinking water. EPA has endorsed the Panel's findings adding that significant cuts in MTBE use should be achieved as quickly as possible. MDE has developed both a short-term and long-term strategy to evaluate the extent of MTBE contamination in Maryland. The plan includes: q  compiling existing data on MTBE and identifying gaps within MDE programs to further define the extent of contamination; collecting data on MTBE contamination and identifying probable sources of known MTBE contamination; developing recommendations for other State and local agencies to include testing for MTBE in conjunction with other mandated testing; targeting environmentally sensitive areas for more frequent sampling; and providing information to further educate the general public.  q  q  q  MDE will work with EPA, other States, and fuel suppliers as EPA addresses its Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendations to phase-out MTBE in gasoline. Additional funding and staff resources have been obtained via the signing of legislation to begin a more complete evaluation of the water quality concerns associated with MTBE. Emergency legislation signed during the 2000 legislative session created a MTBE Task Force consisting of 16 members from various governments, petroleum industry, health-related professionals, and the ethanol industry. The Task Force's preliminary report is due 12/01/2000, with a final report due before 12/01/01. The Task force will assess environmental and health risks associated with ground and surface water contamination by MTBE, examine efforts concerning MTBE contamination, make recommendations regarding risks associated with MTBE contamination, and explore other alternatives to MTBE. In support of Maryland's efforts to: (1) protect ground and surface water used to supply public water systems (source water protection) from contamination, and (2) ensure compliance of public water systems (PWS) with all federal and State requirements, EPA Region III will do the following:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.  Provide MDE with timely electronic and paper copies of proposed and final drinking water rules and guidance for use in commenting and implementation. Provide MDE with timely comments on draft and proposed MDE drinking water rules, regulations and primacy packages submitted to EPA for comment and approval. Consult with MDE regarding primacy extension agreements and provide documents and comments in a timely manner. Provide timely and relevant comments on drinking water and drinking water state revolving fund work plans associated with federal grants. Continue to provide federal funding to support MDE's Safe Drinking Water Act activities, which includes source water protection and compliance assistance. Consult with MDE and take appropriate and timely enforcement actions on PWS's from the Exceptions list. Continue to assist and refer citizen inquires regarding private wells to MDE. Continue to work collaboratively with MDE on burden reduction proposals and allow MDE to utilize the pertinent programmatic portion of the MFR Workplan as the basis for its annual federal grant application. Participate in the upcoming Fall, 2000 meeting with MDE to review the federal grant guidance (Public Water System Supervision Program, Maryland Grant Workplan Guidance, June, 2000   10.  Final) to determine the activities and requirements that are set by regulation and statute for integration into the MFR Workplan and compliance in FFY2001 by MDE's Water Supply Program. Continue to work with Maryland using the SNC process to address both exceptions and new SNCs. High priority areas include: compliance with microbial rules (such as total coliform), compliance with surface water treatment rules, and compliance with lead and copper rules in schools that exceeded the action levels initially. Provide support to Maryland in seeking primacy for the Consumer Confidence Report Program, among other primacy requirements. Back to Top  11.  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Within the Water Management Administration, the federal Public Water System Supervision Grant and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund support a large portion of the staffing costs under this goal. General funds provide the required match. The Solid Waste Program's principal weaknesses include a lack of resources due to statutory reliance on general funds, inability to obtain legislative approval to impose permit fees for solid waste facilities, and a large and complex workload. In addition, the Program lacks staff to maintain landfill files. The Oil Control Program will seek additional EPA support for assistance in resolving the data entry backlog associated with UST Access (described below.) DATA DISCUSSION MDE's drinking water data is maintained in an Oracle 7 database. The database accommodates data pertaining to water system characteristics, ownership, permits, operations, water treatment plants, treatment methods, and geo-referenced well data. The database also contains bacteriologic, chemical, and radiological sampling results for all public water supplies as well as lists of certified operators, samplers, and laboratories. The database applications allow for: 1) tracking of all required chemical, radiological, and bacteriological monitoring, 2) tracking of all inspection, violation, and enforcement actions, 3) tracking system compliance with EPA Total Coliform Rule, Lead and Copper Rule, and Surface Water Treatment Rule, 4) electronic reporting of water system inventory, violation/enforcement actions and other data required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency's State Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) data system. In 1999, the drinking water data was directly linked with a Geographic Information System (GIS). A networked GIS server was created which holds all available and relevant geographic information for source water assessment and protection efforts including contaminant sources, digital topographic and image base maps, watershed boundaries and wellhead protection area boundaries. The information will be shared with local communities, other State programs and agencies to help develop effective source water protection programs. The Solid Waste Program has existed as a regulatory entity for over 85 years and regulates facilities that can have active lives of many decades in length and MDE maintains a tremendous amount of this historical data by hard copy. In FY 2001, MDE intends to integrate data from the drinking water program, the oil program and the solid waste management program into the Department's Enterprise Data System (See Goal #10), and allow greater public access to this information. The Oil Control Program is utilizing the EPA developed program UST Access to track registration information and is still in the process of manually transferring files from the previous database to UST Access. In planning for the transition, the UST data to be entered into the system was to come from   newly submitted registration data from UST owners. The registration data on active systems worked well, however, a large number of UST owners did not resubmit registration information for closed UST systems and a smaller number failed to re-register active systems. This has created a backlog of data needing entry into the system. Therefore, the Program intends to request additional EPA support for either additional data entry or computer technical support to transfer the data from the old system into the new.

Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002 New Initiatives CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination  Childhood lead poisoning is a critical environmental health issue and is generally preventable. There are major initiatives at both the State and federal levels to effect lead risk reduction and to ultimately eliminate lead poisoning in children. MDE investigates cases of childhood lead poisoning referred through the MDE Childhood Lead Registry and has been regulating lead abatement activities since 1988. Under the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1994, MDE tracks and reports the number of lead paint hazard treatments undertaken each year. The Program administers lead poisoning prevention and lead paint abatement services accreditation, maintains a residential rental property registry, conducts paint surveys of residential buildings as part of investigations of lead poisoned children, and educates health care providers and the general public on lead poisoning prevention. Note: Data concerning blood lead screening and lead poisoning is collected by calendar year, is reported to MDE over the first few months of the following year, is evaluated and analyzed over the following several months, and is available in late summer or early fall. Therefore, the calendar year 1998 data will not be available until after submittal of the MFR FY 2001 Workplan. The percentage of children at risk who are screened is an important indicator of Maryland's surveillance system. The incidence of childhood lead poisoning throughout the State indicates the effectiveness of the efforts, including rental property registration, risk reduction, lead paint accreditation, education/outreach, and enforcement activities to reduce lead paint hazards and childhood lead poisoning. Since implementation of the regulations in 1996, over 40,000 lead paint hazard treatments have been completed. In 1997, there were 67,118 children 0-6 years of age screened for lead poisoning (15.3% of all children aged 0-6 years in Maryland). There were 1,233 reported incidences of elevated blood-lead levels statewide (1.8% of children screened exceeded the lead poisoning standard), indicating a decrease in reported occurrences of lead poisoning in children  6 years of age statewide from 1996 to 1997. (See Environmental Indicator chart for 1996 data.)   II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV. Signature Page CHAPTER 4: MARYLAND-EPA FY 2001 WORKPLAN I. MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing  More time is needed to adequately assess the Program's performance. It is known that there are regional differences in the frequency of blood lead screenings and the Program is evaluating the significance of the reduction in the reported lead poisoning cases. Early indications are that there has been a reduction in screening in high risk areas and an increase in screening in lower risk areas, however, more years of data collection and analyses are needed to determine the reason for this finding. In addition, there is an increasing public awareness of the lead poisoning risk and more property owners are complying with the lead risk reduction standards. As compliance in all aspects of the lead law increases, it is expected there will be a concomitant decrease in lead poisoning. No changes to the management strategies should be made until there has been an adequate time period (3+ years) to review performance and analyze trends. Some significant accomplishments of the Program in FY99 include: q  negotiated MOU's with 15 Counties and the City of Baltimore to enhance lead education/outreach activities, including integrating efforts with immunization of Women, Infants, and Children programs, outreach to local property owners, and office visits to local health care providers to encourage an increase in blood lead testing; conducted annual Lead Update Meetings in Hagerstown, Baltimore, and Denton for Health Officers, Environmental Health Directors, and local health department sanitarians and nurses regarding national and State legislation, planning local lead outreach programs, case management protocols, medical updates, coordination of environmental investigations and enforcement activities; conducted meetings with lead paint abatement contractors and training providers regarding updates on legislation, new technology development, new federal requirements, policies and reporting procedures, and data management; and coordinated the annual Lead Poisoning Prevention Week activities throughout the State, including placing advertisements in major and local newspapers reminding rental property owners of the need to comply with the ""Reduction in Lead Risk in Housing"" requirements, placing posters in 400 post offices statewide, providing information to local television stations, and making presentations on lead hazards and lead poisoning prevention at numerous events across the State.  q  q  q  The Lead Poisoning Prevention Program experiences frequent turnovers in enforcement staff. As a result, there is some backlog of enforcement activities. A major strength of the Program, however, is the information it shares with the public and the regulated community regarding lead hazards and lead poisoning prevention. The continued availability of federal funding to support program functions is of concern. For example, the Centers for Disease Control recently significantly cut the Program's grant for data collection and evaluation related to childhood lead poisoning. Environmental Restoration (Superfund) (This applies to NPL, State Superfund and federal facility sites that are not subject to the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC). BRAC and Voluntary Cleanup Program sites are covered under goal # 8.) The Program seeks to eliminate threats to public health from exposure to soils, groundwater, and surface waters contaminated by hazardous waste and other substances. Maryland's rich industrial history has resulted in a significant number of properties where investigation and/or cleanup of contamination are necessary to ensure public health is protected. Cleanup of these properties also has secondary positive impacts, including supporting smart growth by revitalizing formerly used properties, removing blighted properties from community landscapes, increasing the tax base, and, in some cases, supporting economic development efforts. Consistent with federal guidelines under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and State Superfund Law, MDE initiates and oversees the assessment and cleanup of hazardous waste sites where releases have occurred.   Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  MDE participates as a partner with EPA in decision-making at all phases of environmental investigations and in overseeing hazardous waste cleanups at National Priority List (NPL) sites and federal facilities. MDE also oversees cleanups at State Superfund sites. The success of the Program's activities is directly related to its ability to communicate with its stakeholders. For example, at ten federal facilities, restoration advisory boards, (which include members of the community, military base, and local, state and federal regulatory agencies) have been formed to monitor, review, and evaluate federal facilities undergoing environmental restoration activities. At other federal facilities, MDE has entered formal partnering agreements with EPA and the facilities. In addition, several stakeholder groups which were created when Voluntary Cleanup/Brownfields legislation was enacted continue to provide informal feedback on issues related not only to the Voluntary Cleanup Program but also to other ""Superfund"" related issues through forums, meetings and informal discussions.  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  A major Program weakness is the insufficient number of staff and funding to oversee the large number of sites. The Program is required to investigate all sites on the State's Master List, a list of 436 sites known to be, or potentially, contaminated by hazardous waste (also known as State Superfund sites). EPA designated 335 of these sites as ""no further remedial action planned"" or ""NFRAP"". This federal designation does not mean that there is no risk to public health or the environment posed by the site; rather, it means the federal government will not provide funding for the site. These sites are, in essence, turned over to the State program to address. Capital monies are the only source of funds that can be used for the remediation of contamination. MDE must rely on cost recovery from responsible parties and State general funds to oversee remedial work at State Master List sites. On sites where there is no responsible party, work is not progressing due to insufficient funding. In FY99, EPA approved the use of federal monies to pay for the first stage of work, the survey of 132 sites of the 335 NFRAP coded sites on the State Master List. Additionally, the State received general funds for staffing in the FY2000 operating budget to conduct site assessments of the surveyed sites. These assessments have enabled MDE to identify sites by FY2001 that will need remediation. MDE has thus far determined that 3 of the 7 sites assessed using FY 2000 using General Funds will need remediation. Furthermore, 2 of the 3 sites will not have a viable, responsible party and will require State intervention to affect cleanup of the property. FY 2001 PAYGO funds have been provided to remediate the first of these sites: the Sauer Dump site, in Baltimore County. MDE will request FY 2002 PAYGO funding to remediate the next site where a viable, responsible party does not exist. As MDE contacts additional property owners about the need for remediation, we expect that additional contaminated sites with non-viable responsible parties will be discovered. Currently, MDE is actively overseeing remediation and investigations at 105 sites located on 17 federal facilities, 9 NPL sites (non-federal facility/operable units) and 34 State Superfund sites. Overall, steady progress, limited by the available number of staff, is being made on this work. Other accomplishments include:  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project  q  q  The Program oversaw an innovative groundwater remediation project involving the discharge of chemical solvents from the former Spectron Solvent Recycling Center, a National Priorities List (NPL) site, into the Little Elk Creek River in Cecil County. This project involved the diversion of a stream around a groundwater collection and treatment system and then restoration of surface water flow to the area once the remediation was completed. MDE participated in the Bainbridge Naval Training Center Remedial Action Team (BRAT) to plan and coordinate efforts toward completion of CERCLA related environmental cleanup at the site 1200 acre site. Environmental cleanup at the site was completed in   EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  Fall1999 and the property was transferred under the Base Realignment and Closure Act in February 2000 for development. MDE continued to oversee the removal and treatment of contaminated soils at the former Southern Maryland Wood Treating Site in St. Mary's County, a NPL site. Over 240,000 tons of soil has been treated at the site since the remediation action began. MDE is responsible for long-term monitoring at the site once the remediation is completed. Hazardous Waste Hazardous waste is produced as a byproduct of many manufacturing operations and processes. Also, numerous commercial chemical products are regulated as hazardous waste once they are declared to be waste or are intended to be discarded. Consistent with federal guidelines under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the management of hazardous waste in Maryland. The State's hazardous waste regulations have established a comprehensive management program that regulates all aspects of hazardous waste handling, including generation, transport, treatment, storage and disposal. This program is preventative in nature and is designed to eliminate the release of hazardous waste to the environment and achieve a continual decrease in the aggregate amount of hazardous waste generated per year. If such releases occur, cleanup is compelled. Waste minimization industry visits are conducted to promote implementation of pollution prevention technologies. The Hazardous Waste Program: q q  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA  q q  q q q  q  q  issues permits for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities; conducts compliance inspections of hazardous waste generators, transporters and TSD facilities; responds to hazardous waste complaints; responds to hazardous materials incidents involving transportation and conducts inspections of Maryland certified hazardous waste hauling vehicles; oversees groundwater remediations; performs groundwater-monitoring evaluations; encourages waste minimization and pollution prevention through multi-media approaches to the compliance and permitting processes; tracks and identifies generators and transporters of hazardous waste through the issuance of EPA identification numbers and a manifesting system for hazardous waste from point of generation to point of disposal; and drafts comprehensive rules and regulations for the management of hazardous wastes consistent with federal rules.  Information regarding hazardous waste generation in Maryland is reported to MDE biennially by hazardous waste generators. MDE is currently collating and conducting quality assurance/quality control checks on hazardous waste generator report information for the 1999 calendar year which was due by April 2000. This information will then be provided to EPA for a report that will be published in late 2001. The Hazardous Waste Program is considered a maintenance program to ensure protection of public health and the environment from releases of hazardous waste. Since a majority of the funding is received from EPA, the activities of the Program are largely directed by priorities set by EPA for States. It should be noted, that there is a trend toward decreasing numbers of permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSD's) in Maryland. In July 1998, there were 28 permitted TSD's in the State and as of the end of FY200, the number of permitted TSD's is 23. The increase in closure of these sites is believed to be a direct result of better hazardous waste management, waste minimization and pollution prevention activities at facilities, which reduces hazardous waste generation and the need for long-term storage of hazardous wastes. This trend shows an admirable voluntary effort by industry, however, it has not reduced the workload for the Program. The number of small quantity hazardous waste generators which must be monitored   and inspected has remained the same but has the potential to increase, and sites where groundwater contamination is being investigated or remediated still need intensive MDE oversight to ensure protection of public health and the environment. Other accomplishments include: q  Construction activities have begun at the Beazer (former Koppers Company Wood Treating Site) located near Salisbury. The final remedial design has been finalized and approved. Initial studies began at the site shortly after wood-treating operations ceased in 1984. In 1991, Beazer and the Waste Management Administration signed an Administrative Consent Order that served as the framework for additional studies, evaluation of remedial option and implementation of the selected remedy. Planned site activities which began in June 2000 and will continue through June 2001 include construction of a subsurface barrier wall; installation of a hydraulic gate, and in-situ biological treatment system; rerouting of Keens Creek, and several wetlands mitigation projects.  Emergency Response MDE, in cooperation with local hazardous materials units, has the capacity to respond to emergencies to minimize risks to human health and the environment resulting from accidents and/or deliberate actions causing the release of hazardous substances to the air, water or land from fixed facilities, rail, waterway, and truck transportation routes. MDE's management strategies include: q q  q  Responding to emergency situations quickly and effectively. Coordinating planning and training activities with other state, local and private industry emergency response organizations and hazardous materials units to ensure that Maryland has the capacity to respond to emergencies to minimize risks to human health and the environment. Providing training, technical assistance, and logistical support to local government emergency response personnel.  q  Measurements of numbers of emergency response actions are the best means of evaluating success in emergency response. However, the random nature of these events, and the linkage of events to natural factors such as weather, reduces the ability to accurately identify the reasons for any reported trends. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Chemical spill responses have remained relatively constant, with downward trends over the past two years that appear to be associated with milder winters and less highway transportation of heating oil. Local government spill reports continue on a voluntary basis and detract from the use of the information in definitive trend analyses. MDE continued to provide support to local governments in hazardous chemical spill response. In addition to response support, MDE provided training opportunities for local emergency responders in association with the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Plan. MDE continued to work closely with industry in sharing resources and expertise during chemical spill events. The federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) requires that businesses and government agencies that manufacture and/or store hazardous materials report annually to local emergency response officials and the state regarding quantities and types of chemicals present at their facilities. MDE is the repository for this information in the State of Maryland. The Emergency Operations Program maintains a database of this information that is   available for public information. This program also maintains the state's copy of the federal toxic materials release inventory database (TRI). The unit also maintains files and reports regarding hazardous materials released to the air, water and land. Trends in chemical releases from facilities that report under the federal right-to-know program have been presented in ""Maryland's Environmental Indicators"" report. Although there are a number of shortcomings with the use of composite information for trend assessment, the graph of total releases to the environment (page 44 of the 1999 Maryland Environmental Indicators report) is instructive as the general downward trend over the past decade. As with Emergency Response, the random nature of spills and the linkage of events to natural factors such as weather also reduces the ability to accurately identify the reasons for trends in reporting of chemical releases under the federal Toxic Release Inventory reporting. Natural conditions and the economic well being of the country often determine the production of materials that use or release toxic chemicals. Congress and EPA frequently change reporting guidelines and thresholds, thus also making trend assessments challenging. MDE worked with industry to insure that data reports submitted under the Right-to-Know programs was timely and accurate. The public was provided timely access to all data. Enhancements in data handling, specifically the electronic submission and handling continues to progress under an EPA funded grant. When electronic data management is fully implemented in the future, staff efforts can then be directed toward data analysis and utilization in a variety of regulatory, response, and planning functions. Health and Ecological Risk Assessment MDE's Environmental Risk Assessment Program works in cooperation with other MDE programs and state and local health departments in order to ensure that Marylanders and our natural resources are protected from unacceptably high levels of risk due to environmental contamination. MDE toxicologists collect and analyze environmental data to support toxicological evaluations of the health and environmental risk due to hazardous waste sites, chemical releases, contaminated drinking water, naturally occurring radiation, and many other sources of environmental contamination. MDE staff serve on the Maryland Cancer Council, the Maryland Conference of Local Environmental Health Directors and other groups established to evaluate environmentally related health issues. Noise Control Although excessive noise levels are not a ""hazardous material"", noise from human activities can have a significant adverse effect on the public health, the general welfare, and property. Title 3 of the Environment Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that MDE develop and enforce environmental noise standards and coordinate and provide technical assistance to noise control programs in other state and local agencies. Noise complaints are generally constant, with seasonally elevated reports associated with weather conducive to outdoor activities and open windows. MDE staff respond to noise complaints and take measurements and issue notices of violation as required. In most cases, by providing education, mediation, and technical assistance, MDE is able to obtain resolution of complaints without administrative penalties or legal action in 99% of cases. MDE continues to provide technical expertise to other state agencies (e.g. State Highway, Motor Vehicle) and local governments (local police and liquor boards) in regard to noise control. Through training and other technical support, these entities are able to effect noise reductions independently, thus broadening state noise control and monitoring capabilities. Air Pollution Releases of air toxics are controlled by both federal and state regulations. These programs are   described under Goal #1. Back to Top  GOAL PERFORMANCE DATA  Environmental Indicators Children Exceeding Lead Poisoning Standard  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES - FY 2001 The key management objectives under this goal are: Objective 4.1 To reduce the percentage of children poisoned of those tested by 10% each year.   The baseline for poisoning is a venous Elevated Blood Lead (EBL) greater than or equal 20  g/DL (micrograms per deciliter) each year. Objective 4.2 To reduce the amount of hazardous waste potentially subject to release or already released in the environment; Objective 4.3 To prohibit the improper disposal of hazardous waste; Objective 4.4 To oversee environmental restoration at historically contaminated sites; and Objective 4.5 To ensure that Marylanders are protected from unacceptably high levels of environmental contamination by maintaining a strong health and ecological risk assessment capability within MDE. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS Lead Poisoning Prevention The management strategies and action plans described here have been evolving since the organizational infrastructure to implement the most recent of the strategies was put in place in February 1996. In FY 2001, the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program plans to reduce the percentage of lead poisoning by 10%. The baseline for poisoning is an EBL (venous) equal to or greater than 20  g/DL (micrograms per deciliter). This means we are seeking a 10% annual downward trend in the environmental indicator for Lead Poisoning Prevention. The indicator is the number of reported occurrences of blood lead levels at or above 20  g/DL (lead poisoned) expressed as a percentage of the tested population. This will be accomplished through the following strategies: Increase Prevention: q  q  q  q  q q q q  q  Increase the number of units identified in the Lead Property Registry by 10% this year to meet a goal of 85% by the end of year 2003. Increase the number of inspections (both private sector and MDE) to meet a target of inspecting 75% of Maryland's ""Affected Properties"" meeting risk reduction standards by 2003. Increase the number of MOU's to 100% of jurisdictions within the next two years by negotiating MOU's with all 24 local jurisdictions to enhance lead education/outreach work. Negotiate a new 3-year contract to provide counseling services, outreach, and education statewide to tenants as needed to support the ""qualified offer"" by property owners (cap on liability) for relocation and health care assistance to lead poisoned children. Continue other outreach activities and meetings. Add registration and inspection information to the MDE Web site by 2003. Increase early intervention: Track timelines of home community health nurse visits with environmental investigation for lead poisoning cases. Continue to work cooperatively and provide support to the Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission for their statutorily mandated responsibilities. Increase enforcement: MDE will serve as State agency lead to coordinate lead poisoning prevention efforts statewide. SOP's for enforcement are still evolving. A workgroup has been established and meets on a regular basis to resolve this issue. This, in addition to attorneys dedicated to lead enforcement for the program and additional inspectors and support staff, should result in increased enforcement.  q q  q   q  q  q  Issue a minimum of 90% of all accreditations within standard time. 94% of all issued within standard time for CY 99. Continue oversight of accredited contractors, supervisors, and inspectors to ensure accuracy and competency. Begin measurement of enforcement actions taken against lead paint abatement contractors and training providers. EPA will work with Maryland to sample Baltimore schools for lead in drinking water and paint.  Environmental Restoration (Superfund) In FY 2001, the Program will continue to: q  conduct preliminary assessments and environmental site investigations to identify sites that may be contaminated by hazardous waste and prioritize sites for cleanup; provide sole oversight for cleanups at 34 State Superfund sites; and participate in decision-making with EPA, DOD, and responsible parties at all phases of environmental investigations and overseeing cleanups at NPL sites and federal facilities.  q q  EPA will continue to provide MDE with technical and programmatic assistance through the CORE and Site Specific Cooperative Agreements to ensure that MDE has meaningful and substantial involvement in the Federal Superfund program. In addition, for federal facilities, the Program will use new DOD funding to provide oversight of the many formerly used defense sites (FUDS) in the State, an activity that the Program currently has insufficient resources to address. Potential strategies include seeking federal pre-remedial funding, an EPA multi-site agreement, or Defense State Memorandum Of Agreement (DSMOA ) funding. Under State Superfund activities, in FY 2000, the Program conducted further assessments of up to seven of the 132 State Superfund sites (see ""Accomplishments, Status and Trends"" for more detail) designated through initial site surveys as having a high priority regarding environmental contamination and public health impacts. In addition, in FY 2001, the Program will use State capital funds for the planned remediation of up to one site where no viable responsible party can be identified. Hazardous Waste Since this Program is dependent upon EPA federal funding to support its activities and EPA determines priorities for the Program, planning activities can only be projected for one year. Based upon the fact the Program conducted similar activities over the last several RCRA grant periods, it is expected that our level of activity will remain consistent with previous years, depending upon Congressional decisions regarding federal funding. EPA Activities 1. The routine permitting, including renewal and modification, of standard TSD facilities is managed by the authorized states in Region III. Historically, Maryland has been diligent in completing permit commitments each year. In order to assist states as they help in meetings EPA's goal of Better Waste Management, the Region developed a state-specific spreadsheet, which designates the status of each TSD facility for operating and post closure facilities. 2. During FY00, the Region and Maryland undertook a mammoth effort to clean up the RCRIS database for permits and post closure facilities. Both Region III staff and managers worked cooperatively with MD to sort out outdated information. Based on feedback from Headquarter's staff, our combined efforts have resulted in an accurate RCRA universe of permit and post closure facilities. EPA will continue to assist MD with the implementation of RCRA information in   2001. 3. Recently, the Region has formed an Open Burning/Open Detonation (OB/OD) workgroup with VA, WV, MD and PA. In addition, the Region has set aside contract funds to provide OB/OD training as well as technical assistance for Part B reviews. VA has agreed to host the training. The Region's goal is to develop model permits that will be available to all the states. Emergency Response The Program plans to have all oil and chemical spill information geo-coded by the end of the year and will enhance the quality of spill reporting, to include precise address information. Outreach efforts will be directed toward local governments that submit spill reports to MDE. MDE staff will also need to be provided Geographical Positioning System (GPS) equipment and be trained in its use. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know The Program will have an electronic reporting system in place for all right-to-know reporting requirements by the end of FY 2001. Electronic data reporting and management systems being developed under the federal grant will need to be institutionalized within existing programs. Staff resources currently being used to manually manage the data will be redirected toward improved data utilization and analysis as the electronic submission process reduces existing work requirements. Internet accessible databases for all spill and chemical reporting programs will be established by the end of FY 2001. Noise Control The Program will maintain 99% resolution of noise complaints without legal actions being required for each year. Plans are to continue with outreach efforts with local governments and provide complainants with prompt and courteous service. Noise complaint records are scheduled for entry into a database being developed in association with the Department's Compliance Database. Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Lead Poisoning Prevention The program will begin to experience decreases in rental property registration fees in upcoming years. Owners of rental units constructed after 1949, who do not elect to be covered by the law, pay a $5 per unit fee each year. This portion of the law expires on December 31, 2000. Federal funding has also been reduced in recent years. Governor Glendening's Lead Initiative's increased funding for enforcement activity in Baltimore City should stabilize the program funding resources and allow for growth in the activities necessary to implement the strategies and action plans for three years. Superfund Current funding and staff resources allow MDE to address only a portion of NPL, federal facility, and State Superfund sites. With current staff, the Program is able to: q q  oversee investigation and remediation of all active, non-federal facility NPL sites; oversee investigation and remediation of only high and medium priority federal facility sites; and oversee investigation and remediation of a small percentage of State Superfund sites (34  q   sites). The majority of the funding for pre-remedial surveys and investigations at State Superfund sites is provided by EPA, however, the majority of the remedial activities to be performed at State Superfund sites are ineligible for federal funding. In addition, current staffing levels are not sufficient to address formerly used defense sites. (See ""Accomplishments, Status, and Trends for details.) Emergency Response, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know, and Noise Control MDE plans to operate its spill, chemical reporting, and noise control activities within a budget that is similar to preceding years. Enhancements to the program activities will be sought through the reallocation of resources gained through improvements in automated data management. DATA DISCUSSION Hazardous Waste The Program is converting Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Information System data from RCRA facility inspections pertaining to evaluations, violations, and enforcement actions to EPA's RCRA Info system. This conversion will make the data more reliable, and make tying State information into the EPA system easier. MDE intends to conduct this conversion so there is compatibility or integration with MDE's Enterprise System (Goal 10). Emergency Response, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know, and Noise Control Spill and other chemical data is received by MDE units from industry and local governments. All data currently is submitted in paper format and maintained in files. Spill data is converted to electronic files. Selected tracking information obtained from submissions under the federal and state right-to-know programs is recorded electronically, but the information is only converted to electronic format for selected data sets. Noise complaint reports are being entered into a local database in a format that will allow for incorporation into a planned Enterprise System. Lead Poisoning Prevention Problems that make measurements and comparisons questionable at present.  1.  2. 3.  There is no current list of rental properties in the State of MD. There is no listing of owners of rental properties built before 1978. The Md. Department of Assessments & Taxation database contains a listing of residential property and property owners. The listing sometimes has date of construction information. It does not have information on whether a property is a rental or not. There is no current reliable source of information on this. MDE is coordinating with Baltimore City to exchange data they have compiled in a rental property database. There is no requirement for property owners to report turnover. This is the condition that triggers an inspection. Therefore, the number of inspections is driven by turnover frequency. There is no data available on either a statewide basis or a jurisdictional basis to determine a valid and acceptable turnover rate. Data concerning blood lead testing and lead poisoning is analyzed by calendar year. The report is available in August of the subsequent year. Therefore, the calendar year 1999 data is not available at this time.   4. 5.  Year 2000 legislation requires expanded screening for blood lead levels. The increased number of children screened during the next several years may result in higher numbers of elevated blood lead. Given a new database, the statistics may change significantly. Many measurements, comparisons or reports must be created manually due to the fact that various databases at MDE and other agencies are not yet able to be queried sequentially or compared. An enterprise system is under development to resolve this problem. This system may or may not be completed in the next fiscal year.

Maryland's program has been in place for decades and puts a strong emphasis on preventing pollutants from entering the waters of the State and monitoring the quality of shellfish harvesting waters and edible fish tissue to certify that they are safe for human consumption. Increased pressure from population growth and expanded development in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays watersheds present a huge challenge for maintaining this goal. The key areas of emphasis for this goal are (1) ensuring shellfish harvesting waters are safe; and (2) adequately assessing contaminants in fish tissue to assure that Maryland citizens are not exposed to undue carcinogenic or other health risk from fish and shellfish consumption. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Shellfish Harvesting Waters In FY99 a net amount of 1400 acres were closed to harvesting and is attributed to non-point source pollution and several years of above average rainfall. This represents less than a 0.2% increase in areas closed to harvesting. Non-point source pollution combined with climatological events are very difficult to manage. Pollution sources, which can be managed, such as farm practices, are routinely addressed. Also, intensive shoreline surveys were conducted to identify any outstanding pollution sources in the vicinity of the areas closed to harvesting. Fish Tissue Analysis In FY 99 MDE issued an advisory that fishermen should not eat more than 8 oz per month of Potomac River eels and carp, or catfish, larger than 16 inches. The advisory was coordinated with Virginia, which issued a similar advisory and in consultation with the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. Additional follow-up monitoring is planned for FY2000. This advisory will make fishermen aware of the risk of eating those fish so that they can adjust their behavior accordingly. The press release was sent to DNR to distribute with fishing licenses and a brochure was printed for distribution to provide additional advice on how to properly prepare the fish to further reduce risk. The existing advisories in Baltimore Harbor (catfish, eel), Back River (catfish, eel) and Lake Roland (black crappie, carp) continue. The Baltimore Urban Risk Initiative continued this summer to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisories by outreach to fishermen in the Baltimore Harbor region. In addition, to evaluating the effectiveness and public understanding of the advisories, it educated those unfamiliar with the advisories about them, and obtained a better estimate of fish consumption rates which are an important variable in estimating the risk that lead to the advisories.   I.

Without the laboratory data we cannot assess other areas of the state, or re-assess existing advisories to determine if they need to continue, if the contamination has abated. Data have been transferred from the Annapolis data center to local servers, and programs have been upgraded to meet Y2K requirements. Fish Kill Investigations MDE manages and coordinates the interagency program to investigate fish kills in all waters of the state. This is a mandated program, requiring TARSA to effectively receive, respond to, and interpret all reports of damaged aquatic resources. The investigative findings are acted on to enforce the water pollution laws of the Maryland, protect public health, aid in resource management, and contribute to public outreach. Fish kills are caused by a variety of natural and human induced circumstances. Each investigation endeavors to determine the nature and extent of the event and establish a cause if feasible. If a specific pollution source is identified, the investigative findings become invaluable evidence in support of water pollution enforcement litigation, or public health advisory decisions. The fish kill investigation program is an integral component of the current national project to identify and interpret the effects of Pfiesteria piscicida and other harmful algae blooms (HAB's) in waters of the state, and relate the findings to various sources of nutrient pollution.

Further refine the current approach to stream-line the fish kill investigation process through a working relationship with sister agencies, qualified volunteers, technical support, and laboratory support.  EPA Activities In support of Maryland's efforts to achieve the above objectives, EPA Region III will do the following: q  q q q q  q  q  q  Continue to work with Maryland to establish a statewide policy of using risk assessment procedures for consumption advisories that conform to EPA's recommendations. Continue to work with Maryland to develop appropriate E. coli standards. Continue to work with Maryland on the implementation of Pfiesteria strategy. Continue to support the Coastal Bays CCMP. Continue to support Maryland's efforts to identify CAFO facilities located in high-priority areas and to develop a compliance assistance and enforcement strategy to ensure CAFO regulations are complied with. Continue to work with Maryland to investigate causes of microbial, nitrate, and organic MCL violations. Continue to work with MDE to develop a universe of SSOs and investigate and address SSO violations. Continue to provide support in meeting Maryland's commitment to CSO compliance assurance. Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Shellfish Harvesting Waters The goals for shellfish harvesting waters are entirely generally funded. A request has been submitted to increase staff for field monitoring efforts and data management so efforts to meet Information Technology objectives. Without adequate staffing, there is not enough staff time available to devote to implement GIS and meet monitoring needs under pressures from increasing population in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays. Fish Tissue Analysis There are currently no funds specifically allocated for laboratory analysis. Past analyses were dependent on the DHMH laboratory providing ""environmental laboratory services"" which they have not done effectively. This is being handled both by requesting general funding for a contract laboratory and by discussion with DHMH regarding laboratory services. The shortfall as represented by our budget request is approximately $360,000. Staff resources are also not properly devoted to this effort. Two additional positions have been requested to aid in the required field work, to manage the data more effectively, to write more frequent reports, and to work closely with the laboratory to assure the quality of the data and obtain timely results. Fish Kill Investigations This program is entirely supported through general funds.   Back to Top  DATA DISCUSSION Shellfish Harvesting Waters Improvements in data management using new technology will streamline and enhance the program and permit better public access to data. Plans are currently underway to provide better access and ability to share data for other Departmental objectives under the Enterprise System plan (see Goal 10.) Fish Tissue Analysis Recent metals data have been downloaded to a PC-based database for analysis for a report that is in preparation. The entire database has been moved to local servers to increase the ability to share this data in conjunction with the Department's Enterprise System plan (see Goal 10.) Fish Kill Investigations The department needs to improve the fish kill database and incorporate it with the departmental database.

Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002 New Initiatives  MDE GOAL #6: IMPROVING AND PROTECTING MARYLAND'S WATER QUALITY Under federal and State law and regulation, MDE is required to ensure the water resources of the state are maintained and protected. Designated uses for Maryland's waters are specified in regulation and are designed to ensure that its waters meet the federally-mandated Clean Water Act goals of having ""fishable, swimmable"" waters. MDE addresses these responsibilities by implementing various programs to prevent point and non-point source pollutants from entering the waters of the state. MDE uses several legal and programmatic tools to meet this goal, including through strong regulatory programs such as regulation development, permitting, and enforcement as well as non-regulatory or voluntary pollution reduction activities. Key areas of emphasis for this goal include (1) regulatory activities; (2) voluntary activities; (3) stormwater, erosion and sediment (nonpoint source) controls; (4) concentrated animal feeding operations; (5) sewage sludge; (6) abandoned mine reclamation; (7) financial assistance programs; (8) triennial review; and (9) air pollution control (see Goal #1.) ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Regulatory Activities Healthy, sustainable living resources are achieved through the development of management objectives and the implementation of plans that may include both regulatory and voluntary measures. A major portion of Maryland's efforts to achieve living resources goals in the Bays are accomplished through Maryland's participation in the Chesapeake Bay Program and the implementation of our Bay restoration goals. There are a number of Bay Program goals, including reducing the levels of nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay from controllable sources by 40% by the year 2000, reducing inputs of toxic contaminants and numerous specific living resources goals (submerged aquatic vegetation, blue crab management plan, etc). MDE, DNR, and MDA work together with the U.S. EPA and the other signatories to the bay agreement (Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia) to develop effective regulatory and voluntary strategies for reducing pollutant runoff into the Bay and its tributaries. Other activities include special projects, such as the Gunpowder Watershed Project, the Anacostia Watershed Restoration, the Coastal Bays of the National Estuaries Program, and the Baltimore Harbor Toxics Regional Action Plan. These projects provide elements of research and development to enable Maryland to learn and implement new strategies for protecting the waters of the State. MDE's Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report provides detailed information on the regulatory functions performed by MDE staff. Actual data by fiscal year is available each fall. For the past five years, inspection services have been prioritized. The priority order is complaints, violations and their follow-up, and permitted facilities. Total numbers of inspections are relatively consistent from year to year. In FY 1999, an increased number of water quality complaints were received relative to prior years and were responded to in a timely manner. Quarterly permit data show that based on the watershed approach to permitting associated with the implementation of TMDLs, a reduction has resulted in the number of surface water permits issued during FY 1999. However, the number of coal and non-coal mining permits and oil and gas exploration and production permits have increased over prior years. Dam safety, stormwater management and erosion   CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water  and sediment control, and water supply and sewerage construction permits have remained level or decreased slightly. Under Goal #6, the FY 1999 efficiency measure for the percentage of significant violations resolved per total significant violations for stormwater, erosion and sediment control suggests a decline due to the increasing number of unresolved violations (some carried over from prior fiscal year) pending further action by the Administration. This measure fluctuates dramatically during the year but over time it is expected to average around 80%. Voluntary Activities For the past two years, compliance rates across all media have remained consistent which may be due to MDE's approach to compliance assistance. When minor problems are noted at the site, the compliance specialist may give a directive to make a correction without the issuance of a formal violation. At the same time, the number of enforcement cases has increased slightly due to a focus on the elimination of case backlog. Stormwater, Erosion and Sediment (Nonpoint Source) Controls Currently, MDE inspects 100% of industrial and wastewater treatment plants and approximately 55% of stormwater permits. This shortfall in field services has resulted in inadequate oversight of various development projects associated with significant land disturbances. If funded, the FY 2001 initiative will identify and mitigate violations occurring at projects currently not inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources. MDE's ability to assure appropriate reductions in nonpoint source loadings to impaired waters will fall short of what will be required to implement TMDLs. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) An important component of Maryland's water pollution control strategy includes control of nonpoint source pollution from animal feeding operations. The following chronology is provided as background to the current status of the CAFO effort. MDE issued a CAFO general permit in December, 1999, which covered all CAFO's over 1,000 animal units and those operations with documented water quality violations. In the fall of 1998, MDE submitted to EPA a CAFO Strategy that identified who in Maryland would receive general permit coverage, which CAFO's would require individual permits, and how compliance and enforcement actions would be taken. The Maryland Legislature passed a bill and the Governor signed into law the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. This bill requires all farms in Maryland to submit nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plans by 2004 and implementation of these plans by 2005. This bill mandated phytase addition to feed, established manure transport program, provided cost share for development of nutrient management plans, established funding and research efforts for evaluating alternative technologies, and related activities. The first draft of the CAFO permit was prepared in 1998 and was provided to Perdue to review. In the summer of 1999, this language was refined and targeted for distribution as a final draft to Allen Foods, Perdue and Tysons in August. In August,1999, MDE and the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) met with the Speaker of the House and the Chairman of the Environmental Matters Committee and the three companies to brief them on the permits. In FY 2001, the new CAFO co-permits will be issued. MDE's regulatory function will include ensuring that the poultry companies are providing capacity for excess litter and manure; providing technical assistance to contract growers; ensuring that poultry companies are providing quarterly reports on the status of nutrient management planning and implementation of these plans. Sewage Sludge Under State law, MDE regulates the collection, handling, burning, land application, storage, disposal, and transportation of sewage sludge. Improperly managed sewage sludge utilization or disposal practices could result in pollution of groundwater and surface waters, with the potential for impacting drinking water well users, surface water drinking supplies, and boaters and the potential for propagation of disease. The Solid Waste Program's permitting and enforcement activities prevent and control pollutant releases   Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  through the careful assessment of proposed utilization sites and practices, pollution control technologies, routine monitoring of sewage sludge generation facilities and application sites, and complaint investigations. Sewage sludge utilization permits are comprehensive and include evaluations of application rates, slope requirements, evaluation of soil and water conditions on the application site, nutrient requirements, minimum buffers to streams, drainage ditches, springs, wells, roads, property boundaries and groundwater, monitoring requirements, and financial assurance. County governments provide comments regarding permit applications, participate in public meetings and inspections, and in some delegated counties, County Health Departments assist MDE by providing supplemental inspections and monitoring of the permitted sites. Currently, 87% of sewage sludge generated in the State is recycled through land application, pellitizing and composting. Declining revenues in the Sewage Sludge Fund have led to reductions in the inspection staff. The program no longer conducts ""pre-start inspections"", inspection of sites prior to sludge application to ensure that buffer zones are properly marked, restricted soils are avoided, and compliance with other permit conditions. Today the focus is on inspections of operating sites. Often problems are discovered only after they have occurred. Also threatening the program is the increasing polarization of Maryland residents to the use of sewage sludge related to its characteristic odor and perceived public health threats, which limits its availability to farmers and others who use the material as fertilizer. The number of sewage sludge inspections performed increased due to reduction in turnover. In addition, the compliance rate increased and the number of enforcement actions taken has declined. This is believed to be a result of stabilization, which has occurred within the industry and the concomitant development of experience on the part of the sludge applicators' staffs. Abandoned Mine Reclamation Acid mine drainage remediation contributes to ensuring that designated uses are maintained. Examples of recent projects include: q q q q  The North Branch of the Potomac Doser Liming Project; The Cherry Creek Mine Drainage Assessment and Mitigation Project; The GIS/GPS Database Development for Maryland's Abandoned Mine Lands; and Federalsburg Stream Restoration and Abandoned Mine Project.  Projects for the current fiscal year (FY 2000) include: q q q  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and nontidal rivers  Little Meadows Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Project George's Creek Stream Stabilization Project Federalsburg Stream Restoration and Abandoned Mine Project, Phase II.  Financial Assistance Programs Financial assistance methods available for controlling and preventing water pollution are: cost-share program for nutrient removal at municipal wastewater plans, low cost loans from the State's Revolving Loan Fund for point and nonpoint source pollution control projects, grants for stormwater retrofits, costshare grant funds for stream restoration, wetlands restoration and agricultural technical assistance programs, and supplemental State grants for wastewater projects. Additionally, the Department's Financial Assistance Programs have expanded and/or accelerated the use of funding through major enhancements like the Integrated Capital Project Priority System, Linked Deposition Program, and Biological Nutrient Removal Program. In FY 1999, Maryland provided more than $68.6 million in financial assistance to qualified applicants to control pollutant loads which totals about $25.7 million (or 60%) over what was originally projected for FY 1999. MDE is also on track to provide a record $179 million in FY 2000. Much of this increase is associated with the tremendous success achieved in the Water Quality Financing Revolving Loan Fund Program and the accelerated use of funding.   Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  Triennial Review In FY 1999, MDE began its Triennial Review of water quality standards. As part of this review, four public hearings were held to solicit input on what changes should be considered. Although the review is ongoing, current plans include development of a regulation to allow designation of Outstanding Natural Resource Waters in the State, adoption of biological criteria, adoption of ammonia criteria and several other new criteria for toxics. Field evaluation of the effectiveness of new criteria to protect recreational beaches has also begun. Air Pollution Control Air pollution control activities have reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air which have also resulted in a decrease of nitrogen deposition into the waters of the State.

Shellfish monitoring contributes to ensuring that designated uses are maintained. The designated uses for Maryland's waters are defined in regulation and require that certain water quality criteria and standards are achieved through both voluntary and regulatory pollution source controls. Waters that do not meet designated uses are classified as ""impaired"". As required by the federal Clean Water Act, Maryland is developing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for each impaired water body in the State. These TMDLs will be used to help in Maryland's existing efforts to protect and restore water quality. Over 465 TMDLs must be developed for Maryland waters in order to address all of the impairments listed on Maryland Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list of impaired waters. This will require a large effort on the part of MDE and DNR to collect, compile and analyze the available data necessary to assess water quality and point and nonpoint source pollutant-loading sources. The TMDLs must be closely coordinated with the ongoing Chesapeake Bay Nutrient and Toxic Contaminant Reduction Strategies, as well as EPA's Clean Water Action Plan. This coordination is being accomplished through MDE's Interagency TMDL Workgroup and Maryland's participation in the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Coastal Bays Program and the Clean Water Action Plan development and discussions with Maryland's Tributary Strategy Teams. MDE has not held a formal and complete Triennial Review in ten (10) years, so there is a large   accumulation of issues to be dealt with. In addition, there has been several relevant new initiatives from EPA including the Clean Water Action Plan and development of nutrient standards. These activities will be reflected in next year's performance measures as the review of standards is completed and the move to promulgate new regulations begins. Regulatory strategies include permitting and inspection of permitted facilities to ensure compliance. MDE has committed its resources to incorporating EPA's watershed approach into an integrated system of addressing water quality protection activities. A watershed permitting plan has been developed which coincides with Maryland's Agreement to produce TMDLs for impaired water quality segments. The State has been divided into five (5) permitting regions to coordinate NPDES individual permit limits with the point source TMDL allocations. The initial work product will be expanded to include General Permit registrations and has the potential to incorporate other permit activities (e.g., groundwater discharges, stormwater outfalls, non-tidal wetland disturbances, etc.) within a geographically based (GIS) watershed representation. Aside from local government's role in Maryland's water quality standards, and identifying waters to be included on Maryland's 303(d) list, they have three broad roles associated with the TMDL Program. The first is with regard to the development of specific TMDLs. The second is with regard to general topics associated with Maryland's TMDL Program (e.g., striving for coordinated State and local responses to influence evolving federal policies, exploring methodologies for sediment TMDLs as they might relate to stream restoration and biocriteria, exploring the details of TMDL implementation, etc.). The third is with regard to the implementation of specific TMDLs. Additional pollution reductions may also be achieved through pollution prevention efforts and supplemental environmental projects. Compliance Specialists look for opportunities for facilities to explore pollution prevention. Facilities currently in compliance may present a process, waste stream, or operational situation which if changed are not only cost effective for the business but can result in pollutant reductions. Compliance Specialists make referrals to the Maryland Center for Environmental Training to work independently with companies on pollution prevention efforts. Supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) are considered where appropriate in settlement of major pollution enforcement actions. These projects must provide environmental enhancements beyond the regulatory requirements applicable to the company. In exchange for completing the SEP, an offset of penalty  which is far less than the cost/value of performing the project by the facility  is provided. (See Goal #9 for more pollution prevention/compliance assistance information.) MDE's regulatory authority to protect and restore the waters of the State includes the following programs: q q q q q q q q q q  q q q  q q q q q  NPDES Wastewater and Stormwater Discharge Permits to Surface Water (Industrial) Water Appropriation and Use Permit Groundwater Discharge Permit (Municipal or Industrial) NPDES Surface Water Discharge Permit (Municipal) Toxic Material Permit Underground Injection Control Permit Mine Operation Permits (including Land reclamation requirements) Sewerage Construction Permit Well Construction Permit Wetlands and Waterways Permit (Nontidal Wetland/Waterway Construction/Water Quality Certification) Tidal Wetland Licenses and Permits Discharge permits at oil facilities Erosion & Sediment Control and Stormwater Management Approvals for State and Federal Construction Projects NPDES Industrial Stormwater Discharge General Permit for Construction Activities NPDES Municipal Stormwater Permits Dam Safety Permits Gas and Oil Production Permits Inspection, enforcement and compliance activities associated with the above regulatory programs.   q  q q q q q q  NPDES General Permits (seafood processors, mineral mining, coal mining, animal feedlot operations, and hydrostatic testing) Watershed permitting and watershed cycling for monitoring and TMDL development Water quality certification Coastal Zone Consistency Nitrogen oxides control program (see Goal #1) Development or revision of water quality standards Budget initiative for meeting TMDL commitments will allow a comprehensive approach to this new strategy and addresses all critical points to allow each required component of TMDLs to proceed in an efficient and coordinated manner.  Voluntary Activities A variety of voluntary efforts are also underway in Maryland to reduce pollution levels entering Maryland waters by implementation of best management practices on agricultural and urban/residential land uses, residential septic systems, forest harvesting plans, implementation of biological nutrient removal at municipal sewage treatment plants and numerous other programs. These efforts basically rely upon education and outreach efforts, coupled with financial incentives designed to encourage the voluntary participation of citizens and businesses. Pollution prevention is part of a strategy to protect water quality. Efforts include performing P2 screening during pretreatment inspections, incorporating P2 incentives into the permit process, utilizing the established referral system with private contractors, producing P2 videos for industry, promoting P2 training and workshops as an educational tool, and others. Nonpoint Source Other key strategies include the following: q  Ten local jurisdictions are required to submit annual reports in accordance to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations 40 CFR 122. 26(d)(2)(I) documenting new source identification, discharge characterization, and management programs as a condition to their permits. MDE and certain permitted local jurisdictions will certify individuals for the Responsible Personnel Certification Program for implementing erosion and sediment control measures. Finalize and adopt Maryland's draft State Stormwater Design Manual and proposed regulation changes that promote our new approach for the treatment of urban runoff from new and redevelopment sites. Review and delegate erosion and sediment control enforcement authority to local jurisdictions, and perform triennial reviews for county stormwater management programs. Issue stormwater management and erosion/sediment control approvals for state and federal construction projects. Conduct safety inspections of dam structures in Maryland, and issue dam safety permits. Request funding through a budget initiative for sediment and water pollution control field inspections will allow the identification and mitigation of violations occurring at projects not currently being inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources.  q  q  q  q  q q  Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations MDE will continue to work with EPA and the agricultural community to develop reasonable approaches to improving current animal waste management practices. Local Health Services Initiative Over the past 20 year, major pollution reduction initiatives have focused on point sources. The   Chesapeake Bay Program, the State's Tributary Strategies, source protection initiatives of the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements have brought into focus the need to reexamine regulatory schemes for siting, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining septic systems. There also needs to be a more comprehensive approach to alternatives for addressing increasing numbers of failing septic systems. Septic system regulations, policy directives, and delegation agreements with local health departments need to be significantly updated to reflect changing federal, State, and local laws/regulations. The State's subdivision regulations need to be reconciled with local land use planning and subdivision regulations to assure statewide consistency in approving new development projects. Lot size and set back requirements need to be evaluated along with location of septic systems relative to reservoirs, neighboring wells, paved areas, property lines, buildings, etc. New requirements need to incorporate expanded opportunities for clustering, use of shared facilities, innovative/alternative technologies, etc. New subdivision configurations, new septic system maintenance requirements, and broader options for addressing system failures will result in smarter subdivision planning, reduced non-point source pollution, and the systematic elimination of septic system failures. This puts emphasis on pollution prevention, creative subdivision planning, and consideration of cumulative impacts. This initiative will help to reduce nonpoint source pollution and improve water quality through new policy directives for local health departments, closer oversight and improved accountability of locally delegated programs, and new regulations to reflect ways to incorporate new maintenance requirements and new criteria for lot configuration to allow for clustering and use of innovative technology as a means to address cumulative impacts and maximize opportunities for pollution prevention. Successful outcomes would include reduced paved structures, reduced land disturbance, increased buffers, and promotion of open space/green areas. Other benefits will include overall reductions in pollution from subdivisions with on lot septic systems, and the implementation of environmental designs that result in ""low impact development"". Sewage Sludge Program In FY 2001, the Sewage Sludge Program will continue to ensure that permitted sewage sludge utilization and disposal sites facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. To implement this strategy, the following activities will continue to be performed: q  overseeing operating permits for over 900 permitted sewage sludge utilization sites and facilities; performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure these sites are managed properly; ensuring that agricultural and other sludge application sites are properly maintained for 5 years following sludge application; notifying County governments of applications for sewage sludge utilization and disposal sites within their jurisdictions; requiring that regulated facilities are designed and operated with suitable requirements established for pollution prevention and control, including continuing requirements that Nutrient Management Plans be instituted at all farms utilizing sewage sludge as fertilizer; and  q  q  q  q  q  routinely performing unannounced inspections of sewage sludge generation, storage, utilization, and disposal sites to insure compliance.  Abandoned Mine Reclamation The abandoned mine reclamation program's goal is to restore Maryland's ecosystems impacted by prelaw abandoned mines to a healthy condition. The management objectives are to mitigate damage in   streams adversely affected by abandoned mine drainage; remove safety hazards; and restore the quality of terrestrial habitats and return the land to productive use. MDE's management activities include: q q  q  Regulating the activities associated with existing mining operations; Providing funding and oversight of contracts for the cleanup and reclamation of abandoned mines; and Providing funding and oversight of contracts for stream restoration.  Projects to be accomplished in FY 2001 will be: q q q q q q  Mill Run II Shallman Gob Pile Bass Hole Reclamation Potomac Hill Acid Mine Drainage Abatement Everhardt Acid Mine Drainage Abatement Matthew Acid Mine Drainage Abatement  The Bureau of Mines plans to host a symposium in October, 1999 to bring together several states and levels of government to discuss accomplishments to date regarding acid mine drainage and stream restoration. Financial Assistance Maryland anticipates providing up to $83 million in FY 2001in financial assistance to control pollutant loads. The following financial assistance methods continue to be available for controlling and preventing water pollution: cost share program for nutrient removal at municipal wastewater plants, low-cost loans from the State's Revolving Loan Fund for point and nonpoint source pollution control projects, grants for stormwater retrofits, cost share grant funds for stream restoration, wetlands restoration and agricultural technical assistance programs, and supplemental State grants for wastewater projects. Additionally, there has been major enhancements to the Department's Financial Assistance Programs to strategically expand and/or accelerate the use of funding: Integrated Capital Project Priority System The Department has recently adopted an Integrated Project Priority System (IPS) for rating and ranking water quality projects under the Maryland Water Quality State Revolving Loan Fund. The system integrates point and non-point source pollution control project benefits and incorporates State water quality priorities reflected in management strategies contained in the Non-Point Management Plan, the Estuary Plan, the Coastal Bays Plan, Priorities Watersheds, and the Total Maximum Daily Load criteria as the minimum threshold requirement to be considered for funding. Linked Deposit Program  Water Quality Loan Fund Through its ""Linked Deposit Program"" the Department has implemented an innovative way of assisting private properly owners in addressing on-site water quality problems resulting from non-point source pollution. The program allows private landowners to enter into a loan with any one of 39 eligible lending institutions (and branch offices) around the State for capital improvements such as: agricultural best management practices, shoreline erosion control, wetlands creation or enhancement, correction of failing septic systems, removal or replacement of privately-owned and maintained stormwater management facilities. The lending institute underwrites the loan, sets loan terms and conditions, and assumes financial risks for the loan. The lender and the Department enter into an investment agreement for a sum equal to the loan amount where the Department takes a lower than usual rate of interest with the lender passing this discounted rate on to the private borrower. Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR)  Eastern Shore   The BNR Program continues to be the State's principle program for decreasing nutrient loads from point source discharges and a cornerstone in the Chesapeake Bay 40% Nutrient Reduction Goal. In response to Pfiesteria outbreaks on the Lower Eastern Shore and possible linkages to elevated nutrient levels, the Department is fast-tracking implementation of the BNR Program on the Eastern Shore. In total, some 18 Eastern Shore wastewater treatment facilities are now targeted to do BNR and the Department has developed accelerated funding schedules. Triennial Review The President's Clean Water Action Plan places additional emphasis on water quality standards including development of new standards, revision of existing standards, development of bacteria and nutrient standards and streamlining the whole water quality standards process. MDE has requested the staff to meet these needs. Air Pollution Control Air pollution control activities will continue to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air to further decrease nitrogen deposition into the waters of the State. These control activities are described in Goal #1. EPA Activities In support of Maryland's clean water goal, EPA Region III will do the following: q  Continue to work with Maryland to address outstanding Water Quality Standards Issues and triennial reviews. Continue to provide technical assistance for the development of TMDLs and the 303(d) list. Continue to provide technical assistance for the development of TMDLs for the Coastal Bays with the EPA Estuary Program. Continue to support Maryland's implementation of watershed-based permitting. Continue to provide support to the SRF financing of non-traditional water quality activities and coordinate SRF programs with Maryland's comprehensive watershed management program and place-based initiatives. Continue to work with Maryland to develop the universe of SSOs and investigate and address SSO violations. Provide Maryland support in meeting its commitment to CSO compliance assurance. Provide support in dealing with CAFO groundwater and surface water contamination. Support Maryland's effort to identify CAFO facilities located in priority areas and to develop a compliance assistance and enforcement strategy to ensure CAFO regulations are complied with. Continue to provide Maryland support through compliance assistance and outreach efforts focused on stormwater. Support Maryland's implementation of an effective stormwater program that includes strong enforcement and compliance assurance Continue to work with MDE in the spirit of the July 14, 1998 document known as ""EPA Region III and MDE Water Management Administration Agreement Regarding NPDES and Water Pollution  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q   Civil and Administrative Enforcement Response."" Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION In addition, two initiatives requesting additional FY 2001 general funds have been approved by the General Assembly under MFR Goal #6:  1.  Meeting Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Commitments* The TMDL process is built on water quality standards including designated uses and water quality criteria. This process requires acquisition of data from local governments, volunteer monitoring and other databases. It is implemented through development of TMDLs with public participation, and is then implemented in permits. This initiative is a comprehensive approach and addresses all critical points to allow each required component of TMDLs to proceed in an efficient and coordinated process. The initiative includes eight permanent positions, nine contractual positions and funding for contractual services. Two of the eight permanent positions will develop and revise water quality standards as required by the federally mandated Triennial Review for TMDL development. Two other positions will acquire data to write TMDL documentation and will serve as technical liaisons to the regulated community and our stakeholders. Two positions will serve as modelers and will actually develop TMDLs at a faster pace than is possible with current staff. The final two additional permit writers will be necessary to implement TMDLs in permits. (* This initiative also supports MFR Goals #5 and #14.)  2.  Sediment and Water Pollution Control Field Inspections This initiative is to address a shortfall in field services, which results in inadequate oversight of various development projects associated with significant land disturbances. Field verifications are needed to assure that requirements of permits are satisfied and violations are corrected to minimize water quality impairments. Environmental groups continue to raise the issue of the level of inspection of construction projects and have correlated insufficient field services with increased incidence of pollution. This initiative provides funding for the identification and mitigation of violations occurring at projects currently not inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources. This initiative includes five new positions: four Environmental Compliance Specialists and one Water Resources Engineer. The Sewage Sludge Program's principal weaknesses include a lack of resources due to declining revenues in the Sewage Sludge Fund. The increased use of out-of-state disposal sites and the institution of water-reduction techniques at the larger wastewater treatment plants have reduced the volume of sludge produced and therefore decreased the billable volume of sewage sludge which previously supplied the special fund. However, since permits are issued based on fertilizer value in dry tons, not wet tons, this has not decreased the workload for the Program, just the revenue generated. Declining revenues in the Fund have also resulted in MDE eliminating funding of a research project by the University of Maryland regarding the chemicals that cause sewage sludge odor and possible ways of combating the odor, a major public concern regarding land application of the material. Research is essential and must be a key component of sewage sludge management in Maryland.  DATA DISCUSSION Currently, discharge permit data is tracked and reported by MDE's Environmental Permits Service   Center. The mining, gas and oil, and stormwater management and erosion and sediment control data are maintained and reported independently by the respective programs within Water Management. As of July 1, 1999, compliance data is maintained in the newly enhanced Field Investigation Report (FIR). The FIR system is one of the 19 databases that will be used to develop the prototype for the Department's Enterprise System. The new FIR system will allow all inspections conducted for 10 different media to be recorded within the Enterprise System. Concurrently, the new system will allow management to determine if all facilities/sites are being inspected on a timely basis. A scheduling feature of the new system will allow inspectors and management to maximize inspection time. The new system will calculate and record all information needed for the Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report on a monthly basis. (See Goal #13 for the link to MDE's Enterprise System.) The Wetlands and Waterways Program currently maintains its permitting data in an Informix database, RAMS (Regulatory Analysis and Management System), using an HP9000 mini-computer which interfaces with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The RAMS system was developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is operational at MDE and the Baltimore District Offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. MDE's system is compatible with the data system used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Maintenance and technical support for RAMS are provided by Applied Systems in Las Vegas, Nevada and includes support for systems administration, systems modifications and enhancements, and for continued systems maintenance, development, and configuration management. The HP9000 mini-computer primarily supports the RAMS critical database application for the wetlands permitting function that is used by four WMA programs and provides services to 150 internal and external users. This application collects and provides wetlands permits information to MDE and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The HP9000 mini-computer was not Y2K compliant and required the FY 1999 procurement of a replacement computer and communication device. The Informix database, RAMS, will be migrated to the replacement computer during the first half of FY 2000. In FY 2001, major enhancements to RAMS will take place when it is upgraded to RAMS II, a clientserver software environment. MDE plans to migrate/integrate wetlands data to the Department Enterprise System in FY 2001.

In addition, the State has recently adopted an ambitious goal of voluntary restoration of 60,000 acres of wetlands lost since the late 1940s. Key areas of emphasis for the Wetlands program include: (1) maintaining strong regulatory and planning programs to protect tidal and non-tidal wetlands; and (2) developing and maintaining the Governor's Wetlands Restoration Initiative for wetland conservation and creation. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Regulatory Activities MDE's Wetlands and Waterways Program administers regulatory and planning functions which address the protection, conservation, and management of Maryland's tidal and nontidal wetlands, waterways and floodplains. Although these functions are conducted under state statutes and regulations, the challenge is to look beyond the boundaries of state environmental programs to local and federal government authorities and to develop partnerships that take advantage of similar requirements. The goal of these partnerships is not only to establish an efficient regulatory process that eliminates duplicative government actions, but also to produce a strong commitment to resource protection, restoration, conservation and management. Another challenge is to establish mechanisms to enhance customer service. One of the most effective methods implemented to date has been a pre-application meeting, which enable MDE staff to review projects during the planning stages in cooperation with local governments. Using this strategy, all regulatory requirements can be addressed, contradictory requirements can be identified, and an environmentally sensitive project can be designed that complies with both State statutes and local ordinances. Wetland protection and management in Maryland continues to achieve the State's no-net loss goal. A tidal wetland permit or license must be obtained before a person fills, dredges, or otherwise alters a tidal wetland. Similarly, a nontidal wetlands and waterways permit is required for grading or filling activities, excavation or dredging, changing existing drainage patterns, disturbing the water level or water table, or destroying or removing wetland vegetation. Working with our environmental partners, this program received a multi-year award from the Maryland Department of Transportation under the federal Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty First Century (TEA-21) which provides funding for a wide variety of wetland creation projects for mitigating road construction. In recent years, the regulatory program has limited the loss of vegetated tidal wetlands to less than one acre per year. More importantly, Maryland is realizing a net gain in tidal wetlands through mitigation and enhancement projects. Fiscal Year 1999 continued this trend with authorized losses of 0.119 acres, offset by the creation of 7.19 acres of tidal wetlands. Since the inception of the State's nontidal wetland regulatory program in 1991, nontidal wetland losses have averaged approximately 35 acres per year. For Fiscal Year 1999, authorized losses were 22.95 acres, which were mitigated   New Initiatives CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III.

While permit compliance rates for tidal and nontidal wetland activities remain constant at 98-99%, the efficiency measure for FY 1999 suggests a decline in the number of significant violations resolved per the total number of significant violations for nontidal, tidal and floodplain activities. This decline is due to the increasing number of unresolved violations (some carried over from prior fiscal year) pending further action by the Administration. Governor's Wetlands Restoration Initiative MDE's regulatory efforts will be enhanced by the Governor's Wetland Restoration Initiative, which strengthens Maryland's policy of ""no net loss"" of wetlands by including a specific target to increase the State's wetland acreage base by 10 percent. A steering committee of State, federal and local agencies, business and development interests, mining and agricultural interests, and environmental groups has been appointed by the Governor to provide guidance on wetland restoration opportunities and advise on the development of the State Wetland Conservation Plan. This ambitious voluntary effort is a commitment to create, restore, or enhance 60,000 acres of wetlands to restore Maryland's wetland base to post-World War II levels. Wetland gains were also demonstrated under Governor Glendening's Wetland Restoration Initiative. Since its introduction in May of 1997, approximately 1,500 acres of wetlands have been created statewide. This trend should continue with the development of new outreach programs like the State's Landowner Stewardship Referral Service. This cooperative effort, between the Departments of Natural Resources, Environment and Agriculture, Maryland Environmental Trust, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, and the Wetlands Restoration Steering Committee, encourages stewardship programs on privately owned properties to restore critical habitats and protect our waterways from pollutants.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is implementing regulations regarding sewage  and graywater discharges from certain cruise vessels transiting  applicable waters of Alaska. Operators of cruise vessels carrying 500  or more passengers and transiting applicable waters of Alaska are  restricted in where they may discharge effluents and will be required  to perform testing of sewage and graywater discharges and maintain  records of such discharges. The Coast Guard will inspect, monitor, and  oversee this process to ensure compliance with applicable water quality  laws and regulations.  DATES: This rule shall be effective on July 26, 2001.  ADDRESSES: Comments and material received from the public, as well as  documents indicated in this preamble as being available in the docket,  are part of docket CGD17-01-003 and are available for inspection or  copying at room 751 of the Federal Building in Juneau, AK between 9:30  a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Spencer Wood, Seventeenth  District (moc), 907-463-2809.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Regulatory Information      On April 25, 2001, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking  (NPRM) entitled Discharge of Effluents in Certain Alaskan Waters by  Cruise Vessel Operations in the Federal Register (66 FR 20770). We  received 7 letters commenting on the proposed rule. No public hearing  was requested, and none was held.     Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause  exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after  publication in the Federal Register. The regulations enacted by this  final rule are the product of ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship  Operations'' of the Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5666)  passed by Congress on December 21, 2000 in the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2001 (Pub. L. 106-554) (``Title XIV''). Discussed  at greater length below, Title XIV gives the Coast Guard new  enforcement tools essential to curb current sewage and graywater  effluent discharges from large cruise vessels in Alaskan waters. There  is good cause to make this final rule effective upon publishing because  the Coast Guard needs the regulations to enforce the standards set in  Title XIV during the summer 2001 cruise season. The lack of a final  rule has inhibited enforcement of the new legislation during this  season. The Coast Guard has initiated law enforcement action against  two vessels that arrived during the first week of the season for  violating the Title XIV standards. These and other potential violators  of the legislation and these regulations, in particular the self- reporting and record keeping requirements, are currently escaping  complete enforcement action. The inability to wholly enforce Congress'  mandate in Title XIV will continue until the rule is made effective.  Further, the majority (6 of 7) of the public comments received stated  that the Coast Guard should immediately begin enforcement of these  proposed regulations.  Background and Purpose      Congress passed Title XIV in response to public concern with  environmental impacts of cruise vessels on Alaska waters. This  legislation was drafted in the wake of past incidents of illegal  wastewater discharges, the discovery of high levels of fecal coliform  in legal discharges of treated sewage and graywater, the projected  growth of the industry, and the trend within the industry towards  larger vessels that carry over 5000 people.     In December of 1999, a task force comprised of representatives from  the federal government, State government, the cruise industry, and  environmental groups was established to develop voluntary procedures  for sampling and analyzing wastes generated by cruise vessels while  operating in Alaska's waters during the 2000 cruise vessel season.     During the summer 2000 cruise season, the relevant segment of the  cruise industry voluntarily agreed not to discharge treated sewage or  graywater while in port, not to discharge garbage or untreated sewage  in Southeast Alaska's ``Donut Holes'' (bodies of water greater than  three miles from any shoreline yet within Alaska's inside passage), and  not to discharge treated sewage or graywater, unless more than 10 miles  from port and proceeding at a speed of not less than 6 knots.     Additionally, a voluntary sampling and testing protocol and Quality  Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QPC) for treated sewage and  graywater were developed. The protocol and QA/QPC were applied to 21  cruise vessels calling on Alaska ports during the 2000 season.     The test results revealed that the majority of the vessels'  discharges, both treated sewage and graywater, exceeded marine  sanitation device (MSD) design standards for water quality of 200 fecal  coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter total  suspended solids (TSS). The high levels of fecal coliform and TSS found  in treated sewage indicate that the MSDs used by cruise vessels may not  be operating properly or functioning as designed. The Coast Guard  boarded 15 vessels as a result of high fecal coliform and TSS levels.  Five vessels were found to have evidence of improperly functioning  MSDs. The source of the high fecal coliform and TSS found in graywater  has yet to be positively determined.     Concurrent with this voluntary sampling process, Congress was  drafting legislation that addressed sewage and graywater discharges in  Alaska's waters and sought to close the ``Donut Holes'' located in  Southeast Alaska's Inside Passage to untreated sewage discharge. This  legislation was enacted into law on December 21, 2000, as part of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 in the form of Title XIV.  [[Page 38927]]      The summer 2001 cruise season began on May 1st. As in the past two  seasons, the cruise industry has consented to voluntarily participate  in a sampling protocol. The regulatory requirements set forth in the  NPRM are being observed voluntarily. Despite notice of the new  standards and voluntary industry participation in a sampling program  based on those standards, the Coast Guard has initiated law enforcement  action against two vessels that arrived during the first week of the  season for violating the Title XIV standards. However, this law  enforcement action has been limited in the absence of the regulations  stated in this final rule.     These regulations are in response to Title XIV statutory mandate to  draft implementing regulations. Section 1406 of Title XIV directs the  Secretary to incorporate into the commercial vessel examination program  an inspection regime sufficient to verify that operators of cruise  vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and visiting ports in the State  of Alaska or operating in the applicable waters of Alaska are in full  compliance with the environmental record keeping and equipment  requirements of Title XIV, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as  amended, and any regulations issued there under, other applicable  Federal laws and regulations, and all applicable international treaty  requirements. The applicable waters of Alaska are defined as the waters  of the Alexander Archipelago, the navigable waters of the United States  within the State of Alaska, and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine  Research Reserve.  Discussion of Comments and Changes      As noted above, the Coast Guard received 7 comments on the NPRM.  These comments were received from private individuals and  representatives of private environmental organizations. No comments  were received from the cruise ship industry. The comments raised both  general issues about Title XIV and the proposed regulations and  specific issues about the language of the proposed regulations.     The general issues indicated three things. First, commenters  uniformly supported the new legislation and recommended immediate  enforcement of the statute and the proposed regulations. Second, the  majority of the letters urged the Coast Guard to seek increased funding  to ensure rigorous implementation and enforcement of the regulations.  Third, the letters recommended the Coast Guard use as many unannounced  inspections of cruise vessels as necessary to ensure pollution control  equipment is functioning properly.     In raising these general issues, commenters did not recommend  specific changes to the proposed regulations, therefore none have been  made. The first general comment recommending immediate enforcement of  the proposed regulation does, however, support the Coast Guard's  determination that good cause exists for the final rule to be made  effective upon publishing.     One of the 7 comments stated that Title XIV and the proposed  regulations would only create a large environmental problem and that  all cruise ship effluent discharges should be directed to shoreside  processing plants. This comment sought action that is beyond the scope  of Title XIV and this rulemaking. As such, no changes were made in  response to this comment.     Four commenters recommended immediate designation of ``no-discharge  zones'' under Sec. 159.309(a)(2). This section, along with section 1404  of Title XIV from which Sec. 159.309(a)(2) is derived, does not provide  for establishment of no-discharge zones. Instead, they provide for  establishment of areas less than a mile from shore, by the Coast Guard  in consultation with the State of Alaska, for discharge by cruise  ships. The language in Sec. 159.309(a)(2) is directly quoted from the  law. Establishment of no-discharge zones is provided for in Title XIV  section 1410, however, it gives authority to State of Alaska to  petition the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to  establish no-discharge zones, not the Coast Guard. Therefore,  establishment of no-discharge zones is not addressed in this  rulemaking.     Four commenters criticized Secs. 159.309(b)(5) and (6) for being  too general and recommendations were made that a more specific sampling  regime be used. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments and has  made no changes to these sections. The language in Secs. 159.309(b)(5)  and (6) allows for current and future advances in effluent discharge  technology and gives the Captain of the Port (COTP) discretion to  tailor testing for individual vessels. Similarly, there were four  recommendations that the Coast Guard develop a more specific Quality  Assurance /Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) than that prescribed in  Sec. 159.317(b). This section also has not been changed to ensure COTP  flexibility in the face of varying vessel effluent discharge systems.  The Coast Guard believes these concerns are more appropriately  addressed during review of the QA/QCP and VSSP.     Four commenters recommended that the language of Sec. 159.313(b) be  expanded to include inspection of Marine Sanitation Devices, holding  tanks, and other equipment. This equipment is already being examined by  the Coast Guard and the existing language ``general examination of the  vessel'' includes this specific equipment obviating the need for more  specific direction to Coast Guard inspectors.     Four commenters recommended expansion of the Graywater Discharge  Record Book minimum requirements to specify whether the effluent was  treated or untreated, and, if treated, in what manner or with what  specific technology or equipment. The Coast Guard agrees with this  suggestion and has modified Sec. 159.315 to reflect this change.     One commenter recommended that the requirement under  Sec. 159.317(a)(1) be modified to ensure QA/QCPs be uniformly  applicable to all cruise ships. The Coast Guard agrees and the language  of this section has been modified. In addition, the requirement for  submission of a Vessel Specific Sampling Plan has been moved from this  section to Sec. 159.317(a)(3). The Coast Guard believes this change is  necessary after observation of the startup of the 2001 cruise season.  This change is intended to allow a third party contractor, hired to  conduct the sampling, to develop a VSSP adequate for operations in the  applicable waters of Alaska. Therefore, submission of the VSSP should  occur within 30 days of each vessel's initial entry into the applicable  waters of Alaska.     Four commenters recommended the self certification requirement  under Sec. 159.317(a)(2) be based on current samples from treated  sewage and graywater effluents. The Coast Guard agrees and the language  of this section has been modified to ensure that samples are coincident  with the cruise vessel's window of time for annual self certification.     One commenter recommended a requirement be included in Sec. 159.315  that copies of the Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book be  submitted to the Coast Guard and Alaska Department of Environmental  Conservation at regular intervals. The Coast Guard disagrees. The  current language provides for maintenance of the Sewage and Graywater  Discharge Record Book on board the vessel and that it be readily  available for inspection. In addition, language under Sec. 159.313(b)  provides that a copy of any entry in the Sewage and Graywater Discharge  Record Book may be made and the Master of the vessel may be required to  certify that the  [[Page 38928]]  copy is a true copy of the original entry. The Sewage and Graywater  Discharge Record Book is an enforcement tool to ensure compliance with  environmental laws and regulations. The Coast Guard has determined that  maintenance of this record on board the vessel, with full access by the  Coast Guard, is adequate to ensure compliance as mandated by Title XIV.  Regulatory Evaluation      This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section  3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does  not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section  6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not  reviewed it under that Order. It is not ``significant'' under the  regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation  (DOT)(44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation  under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT  follows:     A Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel  Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) is required by these regulations to  establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and  graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary  cruise vessel sampling program a single QA/QCP, acceptable to the Coast  Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for  each vessel. It is anticipated the same, or similar depending on the  laboratory used, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer  cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop new ones. The Coast  Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with  individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP and VSSP, if any.     The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and  Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be  $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and  maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should  be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no  additional labor costs are expected.     During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program,  the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on  sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated  $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional  pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40  CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate  sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage  and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to  the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events  included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants  analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis  regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in  others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis  will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional  pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is  expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for  sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be  $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost  to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348. The estimated cost  to each cruise vessel line is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Cruise line                      Vessels      Cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Princess Cruises..................................          6    $56,088 Holland American..................................          6     56,088 Celebrity.........................................          2     18,696 Norwegian.........................................          2     18,696 Royal Caribbean...................................          2     18,696 Carnival..........................................          1      9,348 Japan.............................................          1      9,348 World Explorer....................................          1      9,348 Crystal Cruises...................................          1      9,348 Radisson Seven Seas...............................          1      9,348 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      The cost is based on two sampling events on each cruise vessel. One  sample event would be required within 30 days of entering Alaska  waters. The second sample event, although discretionary by the Coast  Guard, will be taken from vessels that visit Alaskan waters at least  four times a year. Additional samples and analysis may be required,  along with the associated cost increase, should the initial sample  results indicate noncompliance.     The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the costs that might be  incurred if a cruise vessel cannot certify that their discharges meet  the applicable standards, and does not have the capacity to hold all of  its discharges while transiting the applicable waters of Alaska. In  that scenario, it is believed that the cruise vessel would need to  alter its cruise itinerary in order to leave the applicable Alaskan  waters and enter the high seas, thus enabling the vessel to discharge.  We asked for comments to help us estimate this cost, but none were  received.  Small Entities      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have  considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact  on a substantial number of small entities. The term ``small entities''  comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are  independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields,  and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.     Because the population of affected cruise vessels are owned by  entities that do not qualify as small entities, the Coast Guard  certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Collection of Information      This rule provides for a collection of information under the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). As defined in  5 CFR 1320.3(c), ``collection of information'' includes reporting,  record keeping, monitoring, posting, labeling, and other, similar  actions. The title and description of the collections, a description of  the respondents, and an estimate of the total annual burden follow.  Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,  searching existing sources of data, gathering and maintaining the data  needed, and completing and reviewing the collection.

L. 106-554).     Proposed use of Information: Regulatory oversight and compliance  assurance.     Description of the Respondents: Master or other person having  charge of each cruise vessel authorized to carry 500 or more passengers  while operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and the  navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska and  within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.  [[Page 38929]]      Number of Respondents: 23.     Frequency of Response: Periodically while operating in the waters  described above.     Burden of Response: There are three separate record keeping  requirements involved in this regulation. Each is addressed separately,  and the estimated total burden follows:     1. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel  Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) development costs.     A QA/QCP with VSSP is required by these regulations to establish  procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater  samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise  vessel sampling program, a single QA/QCP acceptable to the Coast Guard,  was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each  vessel and sampling was conducted in compliance with these documents.  It is anticipated the same, or similar, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used  for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to  develop a new QA/QCP or VSSP. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate  the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel  revisions to the QA/QCP or VSSP, if any.     2. Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book costs. The annual  burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge  Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate  is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard  each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the  normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs  are expected.     3. Sample collection and analysis costs.     a. During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program,  the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on  sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated  $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional  pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40  CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate  sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage  and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to  the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events  included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants  analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis  regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in  others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis  will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional  pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is  expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual cost for  sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be  $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost  to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348.     Estimated Total Annual Burden: The estimated total annual burden is  $215,460.     As required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of  1995, the Coast Guard submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its  review of the collection of information.     The Coast Guard solicited public comment on the collection of  information to: (1) Evaluate whether the information is necessary for  the proper performance of the functions of the Coast Guard, including  whether the information will have practical utility; (2) evaluate the  accuracy of the Coast Guard's estimate of the burden of the collection,  including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3)  enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be  collected; and (4) minimize the burden of the collection on those who  are to respond, as by allowing the submittal of responses by electronic  means or the use of other forms of information technology.     OMB has approved our collection of information and assigned to it  OMB control number 2115-0647. This approval expires on December 31,  2001. Persons are not required to respond to a collection of  information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.  Federalism      Under Executive Order 13132, section 3(b), the Coast Guard finds  that a program monitoring effluent discharge from cruise ships  transiting certain Alaskan waters is in the national interest, as  evidenced by Congress in enacting ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise  Ship Operations'' as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2001 (Pub. L. 106-554). In that legislation, Congress empowered the  Coast Guard to monitor wastewater discharges from cruise ships  transiting certain Alaskan waters.     The sampling, testing and log-keeping program outlined in this  regulation was taken from a similar program that was run on a voluntary  basis during the summer of 2000. That program was one of the results of  the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative, which grew out of a working group  composed of representatives from the cruise industry, the public,  environmental groups, and state and federal government. The Coast Guard  was one of the federal government representatives on that group. The  working group was begun by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of  Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in December of 1999.     At the conclusion of the 2000 Alaskan cruise ship season, data from  the voluntary wastewater sampling and testing program showed that none  of the tested vessels were in full compliance with all federal  performance standards for the discharge of treated sewage. This data,  as well as data showing high levels of pollutants in graywater, spurred  the legislation cited above. It also spurred a meeting between the  Alaska governor, ADEC, the Coast Guard, and members of the cruise ship  industry in November of 2000. At this meeting, the governor expressed  his approval of the then-proposed Title XIV, and the greater authority  it granted to the Coast Guard to protect Alaskan waters from  pollutants.     This established cooperation between the Coast Guard and the State  of Alaska, and the State's support of the legislation and voluntary  testing program on which the regulation is based shows how the Coast  Guard has consulted with State officials in accordance with Executive  Order 13132, Section 3(b). The Coast Guard will continue to consult the  State by sharing the results of sample tests with the State, as well as  requiring that discharge logbooks be kept in a format readable by the  Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation.     Section 6(c)(2) of Executive Order 13132, requires, that if the  agency promulgating the regulations intends that they have preemptive  effect, it state that intention and the rationale on which it is based.  Accordingly, the following statement is provided:     Section 1411 (b) Pub. L. 106-554 specifies that, ``[n]othing in  this Title shall in any way affect or restrict, or be construed to  affect or restrict, the authority of the State of Alaska or any  political subdivision thereof--(1) to impose additional liability or  additional requirements; * * *.'' This language, was drafted so as to  be identical to the savings clause in Section 1018 of the Oil Pollution  Act of 1990, which was recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in the  case of U.S. v. Locke, 120 S.Ct. 1135 (Mar. 6, 2000). The Court held  that a state could regulate regarding actual discharges, but could  [[Page 38930]]  not regulate in the areas of design, construction, alteration, repair,  maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, or manning  of vessels. In the Department of Transportation's letter transmitting  Title XIV of Pub. L. 106-554 to Congress, we explained that conference  report language on Title XIV should explain that preemption for this  bill would work in the same manner as in OPA 90. We also discussed this  position with the Alaska Attorney General's Office.     Accordingly, these rules are construed in the same manner as OPA  90, as described in the Department of Transportation's views letter  referred to above. Thus, any of these regulations that have the effect  of regulating a cruise vessel's design, construction, alteration,  repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification,  manning and casualty reporting have preemptive effect under existing  U.S. laws and treaties to which the United States is a party. However,  state legislation regulation actual discharges only is not preempted by  these regulations.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538)  requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary  regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may  result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in  the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any  one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we  do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.  Taking of Private Property      This rule will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise  have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental  Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property  Rights.  Civil Justice Reform      This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2)  of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation,  eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.  Protection of Children      We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection  of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule  is not an economically significant rule and does not create an  environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may  disproportionately affect children.  Indian Tribal Governments      This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order  13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments,  because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more  Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and  Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities  between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.  Environment      We have considered the environmental impact of this rule and  concluded that, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(d), of Commandant  Instruction M16475.1C, this rule is categorically excluded from further  environmental documentation. This proposed regulation would require  operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers in Alaskan  waters to document treated sewage and graywater discharges to ensure  that they comply with effluent discharge standards. The content of  effluent discharges reflects compliant equipment operations. A  ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket  where indicated under ADDRESSES.  Energy Effects      We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions  Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply,  Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a ``significant  energy action'' under that order because it is not a ``significant  regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to  have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use  of energy. It has not been designated by the Administrator of the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as a significant energy  action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects  under Executive Order 13211.

Children (especially very young children) and fetuses are most vulnerable.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  are jointly issuing an alert to the general public.  There is a continuing pattern of metallic mercury exposure in children and teenagers and in persons using certain folk medicines or participating in certain ethnic or religious practices.   It is important for the general public to understand that either short-term or long-term exposures to metallic mercury can lead to serious health problems.  Human exposure to metallic mercury occurs primarily from breathing contaminated air. Other forms of mercury can be absorbed by drinking contaminated water, eating food (usually fish containing mercury), and from skin contact. At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems.  Metallic mercury exposure can cause harm before symptoms arise.   Once released into the environment, mercury is very hard to clear up.  If it is left unattended where exposures can occur, it can have dangerous effects on human health.    Incidents involving schoolchildren    In recent years, increasing numbers of metallic mercury spills and contamination involving schoolchildren have been reported:   In August 1994, more than 500 students in Belle Glade, Florida, were contaminated with metallic mercury after three children found 4 jars (totalling 55 pounds) of metallic-mercury in an abandoned van. The local hazardous waste materials team decontaminated the children (removed contaminated clothing and washed the metallic mercury from their skin). More than 20 families had to be evacuated while their homes were decontaminated.     In November 1994, college students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, removed metallic mercury from one of the school's laboratories. Students living in the dormitory were evacuated and housed in a local hotel while the dormitory was decontaminated.    In June 1996, metallic mercury was taken from a middle school in St. Joseph, Missouri, and used in and outside of school by a group of teenagers. Approximately 200 children were tested for mercury exposure; one child was hospitalized and another five underwent outpatient treatment to remove the mercury from their systems; 20 other children had mildly elevated mercury levels. Two homes and a car required extensive decontamination.   In October 1996, a high school in Oskaloosa, Kansas and a convalescent home in Johnson County, Kansas, were contaminated with metallic mercury; 52 students and an unknown number of residents of the home were tested. On the basis of ATSDR recommendations, the school was closed for a week until indoor air levels were safe. A month later, sampling at the school identified an increase in air mercury concentrations.  The school was re-evaluated and additional clean-up was done as recommended by ATSDR.     In November 1996, ATSDR again assisted state health officials and EPA in evaluating contamination at a high school and a home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, near Wilkes-Barre. Four areas in the school had levels of metallic mercury contamination that required cleanup.   In March 1997, a middle school student on his way to school found metallic mercury on the street in front of his home in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The student took the metallic mercury to school and shared it with three to four classmates. Also, in March 1997 a broken mercury thermometer was discovered after school on the floor of a bathroom stall in the boys bathroom. One thermometer was confirmed missing from the science department's inventory. The school was found to be clear of contamination with the exception of one science laboratory and the carpet in a classroom. Two homes required decontamination.    Schoolteachers, particularly science teachers, and administrators need to be aware of students' interest in mercury, especially metallic mercury, and take steps to ensure that children are aware of its dangers and that any mercury kept in school is safely and securely contained.     Incidents involving religious practices    Persons who use metallic mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices are at risk. Metallic mercury is sold under the name  ""azogue""  in stores (sometimes called botanicas), which specialize in religious items used in Esperitismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico), Santeria (a Cuban-based religion that venerates both African deities and Catholic saints), and voodoo.    The use of azogue in religious practices is recommended in some Hispanic communities by family members, spiritualists, card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carried on one's person in a sealed pouch prepared by a spiritual leader or sprinkled in the home or automobile. Some botanica owners suggest mixing it in bath water or perfume and placing it in devotional candles.    General facts    The following are general facts about metallic mercury and its risks, as well as information about how people can protect themselves from exposure and resulting health effects.    What is mercury and how is it used?    Mercury occurs naturally in the environment in several forms.  Metallic Mercury is the liquid form used in thermometers.  Mercury is also used in other common consumer products such as fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, medical equipment such as blood pressure measurement instruments, and mercury switches in children's sneakers that light up. This alert concentrates on metallic mercury, but hazards are also associated with other types. Of these, the most common is methyl mercury contamination of fish.    How could I be exposed to mercury?    In the previously described school-associated cases, children were unaware of the dangers involved in exposing themselves and their families to this deadly poison. Adults are also often unaware of the hazards associated with mercury; some have even brought it home from work for children to play with. Just one-half teaspoon of mercury spilled in the home can be dangerous.   Adults using certain folk medicines or participating in certain religious or ethnic practices may also expose themselves and their families to metallic mercury's effects. Because metallic mercury vaporizes into the air at room temperatures, it presents an immediate health risk to anyone spending a significant amount of time in a room where metallic mercury is sprinkled or spilled onto the floor, or where opened containers of metallic mercury are present. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few drops) can raise air concentrations to levels that may be harmful to health.    How does mercury affect health?    At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems. Mercury exposure can begin to cause harm before symptoms arise. Once symptoms do arise, health problems related to metallic mercury poisoning can include tremors, changes in vision or hearing, insomnia, weakness, difficulty with memory, headache, irritability, shyness and nervousness, and a health condition called acrodynia.     Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of metallic mercury because it readily passes from the placenta to the fetus. Mercury may accumulate in higher concentrations in the unborn baby than in the mother. Young children, who often play on the floor where metallic mercury may have been spilled, are particularly at risk for effects on the central nervous system. Mercury vapors are readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the lungs, and the human central nervous system, which is still developing during the first few years of life, may become damaged.    Health effects can result from short-term or long-term exposure. The body gets rid of mercury through the urine and feces. Removal of this substance from the body can take up to several months after exposure. Acrodynia is characterized by itching, swelling, and flushing; pink-colored palms and soles of the feet; excessive perspiration; rashes; irritability; fretfulness; sleeplessness; joint pains and weakness. Children exposed to metallic mercury for long periods may have trouble learning in school. When mercury levels in the body are extremely high, ""chelation"" therapy is necessary. Chelation therapy involves putting a chemical into the bloodstream; the chemical combines with the mercury to aid in its removal from the body.     Prevention is the key to avoiding poisoning in homes, schools, and families.    What is mercury contamination and how can I prevent it?    First, avoid using metallic mercury.  Appropriate substitutes are available for nearly all uses of metallic mercury.  Therefore, be sure you need to use it. If not, make arrangements to safely dispose of whatever metallic mercury you might have. If you do need to use metallic mercury, make sure it is safely stored in a leakproof container. Keep it in a secure space (e.g., a locking closet) so that others cannot easily get it.  Use of metallic mercury in a controlled environment helps to reduce the risk that contamination will occur.    Mercury contamination results from exposure through the air, water, food, soil, or direct contact.  Exposure to metallic mercury occurs when it is not stored in a closed container. Contamination may include the spilling of metallic mercury on clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, walls, the natural environment, and even the human body.  Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to remove from such items as clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, and walls. The vapors will also accumulate in walls and other structures in contaminated rooms. The contamination can remain for months or years, posing a risk to exposed individuals. The use of metallic mercury in a home or apartment not only poses a threat to persons currently residing in that structure, but also to those who subsequently occupy that dwelling and are unaware of the past mercury use.   Can I clean up mercury with a vacuum cleaner?    Never use a vacuum cleaner. Using a vacuum cleaner causes metallic mercury to vaporize in the air, creating greater health risks. It also ruins the vacuum cleaner.    Can electronic equipment collect mercury vapors?    Metallic mercury vapors can accumulate in electronic equipment, especially computers.  When the computer is turned on, the mercury revaporizes. This cycle of metallic mercury collecting and vaporizing from computers has been seen in several incidents in schools.   What should I do to keep my home safe?    Metallic mercury is used in a variety of household and industrial items including thermostats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressure machines. Care must be taken in handling and disposing of all items in the home that contain metallic mercury.   First,  do NOT  try to vacuum or heat the metallic mercury in any way.  Mercury vapors are very dangerous and are virtually undetectable.  Avoid breathing mercury dust, vapor, mist, or gas.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. If you feel you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury, wash thoroughly after handling.  Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse. Provide as much clean air as possible.    For example, if a thermometer breaks, remove children from the area. Clean up the bead of metallic mercury by carefully rolling it onto a sheet of paper or sucking it up with an eye dropper. After picking up the metallic mercury, put it into a bag or airtight container. The paper or eye dropper should also be bagged and disposed of properly according to guidance provided by environmental officials or your local health department. Try to ventilate the room to the outside and close off from the rest of the home. Use fans for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If larger amounts of metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar), make sure that the metallic mercury is in an airtight container and call your local health department for instructions in how to safely dispose of it. If the larger amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department and fire authorities.  Do not simply throw it away, but instead seek professional guidance.    ATSDR and EPA do not recommend the use of uncontained metallic (liquid) mercury (that is, mercury not properly enclosed in glass as it is in thermometers) in homes, automobiles, day care centers, schools, offices, and other public buildings.

The State of Alaska last year passed the first state law providing          for inspection, monitoring, and oversight of cruise ships and setting          standards for wastewater discharges.         ""We're pleased          to see a sharp decrease in the number of smoke violations and emissions          complaints from the public this year as compared to last,"" said Commissioner          Michele Brown. ""The cruise companies have been attentive and inventive          in achieving emissions improvements, attributable to the use of shoreside          power, fuel additives, and increased use of gas turbine engines.""                   The wastewater treatment          progress has been more mixed. ""Seven ships have installed advanced          wastewater treatment systems which meet all standards when operating properly.          These systems are costly and represent a serious commitment to prevent          polluting our waters. We remain concerned, however, that ten large and          three small vessels still opt to discharge wastewater outside state waters          rather than improve treatment,"" Brown said. ""Vessels that choose          this course may not be treating wastes and do not provide the monitoring          and verification required by the Alaska program.""         As a result, Governor          Tony Knowles has asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take          action to curb cruise ship wastewater discharges beyond Alaska's waters.          ""I ask the Environmental Protection Agency to take swift and firm          action to control sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships operating          both inside and outside of Alaska waters,"" Knowles wrote in a letter          last year.         Knowles specifically          asked the EPA to prohibit wastewater discharges in U.S. waters unless          the wastes have been processed through a properly operating and maintained          sewage treatment system, to set strict treatment standards, and to require          testing. ""It's not acceptable to simply move sewage outside Alaska's          borders,"" Knowles said. ""Alaskans are concerned that the continuous          discharge of wastewater with high levels of contamination may result in          unintended impacts that could harm marine life.""         The mid-season report          summarizes the performance of large and small vessels, under the new state          law, based on data collected through the first week of August. The new          state program requires registration and fees, which finance the oversight          effort. A final report is expected to come out after the end of the season.         Forty-four cruise          ships registered this year: 25 large vessels, 14 small ones, and 5 ferries.          Small vessels accommodate between 50 and 249 overnight passengers.         The following summarizes          where cruise vessels are discharging their wastewater:         "" Seven ships          have installed advanced wastewater treatment to remove bacteria and solids.          Six of these meet very stringent requirements that allow them to discharge          at any time in Alaska waters. One vessel meets the standards set for discharging          over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum of six knots.         "" Eight large          ships hold their blackwater (sewage) for discharge outside state waters          and discharge graywater over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum          of six knots. The law provided for a transition period to phase in graywater          treatment. Next season, all vessels must treat graywater to the same level          as blackwater before discharging in state waters.         "" 10 large ships          hold both black and gray water for discharge outside state waters.         "" 19 small ships          and ferries must test their wastewater but don't need to meet standards          until January 2004 and can discharge black and graywater anywhere, anytime.         Carolyn Morehouse          of DEC's Commercial Passenger Vessel Environmental Compliance program          said that DEC has not received laboratory results on tests for other pollutants          in the wastewater discharged in Alaska's waters.          DEC is investigating          a discharge of foamy sludge August 17th from the Ryndam at a dock in Juneau.          Sample test results are still pending. The Ryndam is one of five of Holland          America's six Alaska-bound ships that use advanced wastewater treatment.          Morehouse said that the discharge appears accidental, but DEC will be          fully investigating since proper operation of a wastewater system is as          important as having a quality system.         The report notes          that DEC increased its smoke readings by five percent to include for the          first time Southcentral Alaska ports of Seward, Valdez, Kodiak, Cordova          and Whittier. Previous ambient air monitoring studies in Juneau, with          the highest cruise ship traffic, showed levels well below regulatory standards.         A Science Advisory          Panel of independent experts continues to help DEC assess the impact of          wastewater discharges from cruise ships and ferries on human health and          the Alaska environment. The panel's findings will be included in an assessment          report on the impact of small commercial passenger vessels in Alaska,          due out in December.                    ##         For more information          contact Carolyn Morehouse, 465-5279.

GX232-87-12394531	"Marina Management Once you have adopted some of the best management practices outlined in this Guidebook, tell people about it! Train your staff so that they will routinely minimize pollution. Inform boaters how their actions can effect water quality. And let the public know that you are doing your part to protect the environment.  Staff Training Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The General Permit for Discharges from Marinas requires that you teach your employees about the components and goals of the stormwater pollution prevention plan. The training must be conducted at least twice a year and must address the following topics as applicable. u Used oil management u Spent solvent management u Proper disposal of spent abrasives u Disposal of vessel wastewater u Spill prevention and control u Fueling procedures u General good housekeeping u Painting and blasting procedures u Used battery management Also, provide training on the proper use of equipment such as dustless sanders and high-volume low-pressure spray guns. Refer to Appendix XI for a training guide to help you organize and track your employee training. Emergency Response Plans. During a real emergencywhen time is of the essenceyou will want people to know what to do and how to do it. v Review plans and response procedures with staff at the beginning of each boating season. v Train employees in the use of containment measures. v Run emergency response drills at least twice annually.  Invite the U.S. Coast Guard and local fire department to demonstrate emergency response procedures at your marina. Be Watchful. Involve all employees in policing your marina for waste. Encourage your staff to look for and immediately halt the following activities.  Colored plumes in the water where a hull is being cleaned.  Bilge water discharge with a sheen.  Uncontained sanding, painting, varnishing, or cleaning.  Maintenance debris being washed into the water.  Sewage discharges within the marina.  The use of environmentally harmful cleaning products.  u  --Law or regulation, v--Highly recommended, --Recommended / Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook  65   Approach Polluters. v Determine who will address boaters and contractors who are polluting. Generally speaking, this is a job for the manager. Let your staff know whether they should handle polluters themselves or report pollution incidents to the manager. v Politely inform boaters and contractors why what they are doing is harmful. Describe a more environmentally sensitive method and ask the boater or contractor to stop work until it can be done with less environmental impact. It will be easier to get cooperation if you require boaters and contractors to practice pollution prevention as a condition of their contracts. v If the problem persists, take these additional steps  Talk to the boater or contractor again.  Mail a written notice asking that the harmful practice stop. Keep a record of the mailing.  Remove the problem from the dock. Charge the boater or contractor for the cost of removal and clean-up.  Ask the tenant or contractor to leave your marina. Investigate Community College Offerings. v Look for college courses related to environmental protection. For example, Anne Arundel Community College has offered a course titled Environmental Compliance for Marinas and Boatyards. Maintain Training Records. v Record training dates, topics, and names of employees and instructors. v Keep copies of instructional material.  If a boater is sanding and not containing the debris, bring a vacuum sander to him or her. Explain that it collects most of the dust and allows one to work more quickly. Charge him or her your standard rental fee for the equipment.  Inform Patrons and Independent Contractors The General Permit for Discharges from Marinas requires that customers and contractors be informed about pollution control practices and be required to use them. Incorporate Best Management Practices into Contracts. In addition to being a legal document, contracts are very effective educational tools. Use the contract to inform boaters and contractors how to minimize their environmental impacts. v Include language requiring the use of best management practices in all of your contracts: slip holders, liveaboards, transients, charters, workers, contractors, and tenants. v Include language specifying the consequences for not using best management practices, e.g., failure to use best management practices will result in expulsion from the marina and forfeiture of rental fees. v Include information about requirements for Marine Sanitation Devices.  See Appendix V for sample contract language. Call the Department of Natural Resources if you would like to receive an electronic copy of the contract language.  66  Marina Management   Post Signs Detailing Best Management Practices. v Post signs at fuel docks and pumpout stations, along piers, in vessel maintenance areas, and at dumpsters and recycling stations. See samples below. v Be sure the signs are visible. v Signs must be durable, eye catching, and appropriately sized. v Post your facility's environmental policy in a conspicuous location.

Environmental Policy It is the policy of this marina to protect the health of our patrons, staff, and the environment by minimizing the discharge of pollutants to the water and air.  Thank you for keeping the Bay clean and safe!  Distribute Literature to Patrons. v Copy and distribute the Clean Boating Tip Sheets included in this Guidebook or create your own. Boater tip sheets on Vessel Maintenance, Selecting a Bottom Paint, Underwater Hull Cleaning, Petroleum Control, Boat Sewage, and Waste Disposal can be found at the end of this book. v Send the tip sheets with monthly mailings or place in dock boxes or on vessels. Be cautious that they do not end up in the water. v Include articles about best management practices in your newsletter. v Get copies of clean boating materials from organizations such as the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, the Ocean Conservancy, and BoatU.S. Foundation. v Contact the United States Coast Guard for publications summarizing Federal boating requirements. Host a Workshop. v Include a walking tour of the facility to demonstrate best management practices. v Try to schedule the workshop to coincide with an existing marina function that is traditionally well attended.  Offer incentives to attendees: door prizes, discounts, product samples, food. Make Use of Informal Communication Mechanisms. v Pass along pollution prevention information in conversations with patrons and contractors. v Post information about best management practices on the marina bulletin board.  u--Law  or regulation, v--Highly recommended, --Recommended / Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook  69   Recognize Boaters. v Publicly recognize boaters who are making an effort to control pollution. v Include a feature in your newsletter, post a flyer with the boater 's picture on a public bulletin board, give an award, etc.  Public Relations Publicize Your Good Deeds. v Seek free publicity with local press, magazines, television, and radio outlets. v Prepare news releases to highlight your innovative practices, new equipment or services, available literature, or a workshop you are sponsoring. v Plan news releases to coincide with seasonal activities, e.g., helpful tips for winterization. v Start news releases with a contact person's name and phone number, the date, and a headline. The first paragraph should contain vital information: who, what, when, and where. Fill in with secondary information and support data. Conclude with a ""call to action"" (e.g., visit the marina for a demonstration of the new plastic media blasting system). Double-space the text. One page is best. It should be no longer than two pages. Refer to the Associated Press Style Book for additional formatting information. v Learn media deadlines and send releases in time to meet them. v When submitting a news release, be sure you have the name of the correct editor and that it is spelled accurately.  Get press kits from manufacturers of environmentally-sensitive products. Use their photographs and product information. Become a Maryland Clean Marina. v Apply to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources for recognition as a Maryland Clean Marina. Once you have satisfied the selection criteria, you may use the Maryland Clean Marina logo in your advertising and correspondence, fly a Clean Marina flag, and enjoy promotion by the Clean Marina Initiative in publications, on the World Wide Web, and at public events. v Use your selection into the program as an opportunity to prepare a press release.  Business Practices Offer Environmental Audits for Boaters.  Expand your business by selling environmental audits.  Inspect engines, bilges, fuel systems, and marine sanitation devices.  Sell oil absorbent pads, air/fuel separators, etc. Consider Environmental Surcharges. v Charge for tangible items such as tarps, vacuum sanders, and protective clothing or establish a flat ""environmental surcharge"" on all jobs.  70  Marina Management    Consider donating a portion of rental fees (e.g., for vacuum sanders) to an environmental organization. The boater can feel good about controlling pollution and about the fact that a portion of his or her money is going to help conserve nature. Be Diligent. v Be absolutely diligent in containing pollution; your own and that created by your staff. Boaters will notice and follow your example.
