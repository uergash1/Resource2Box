In this article, the author states that environmentalists are attacking Starbucks because it is a successful capitalist company. The first argument against Starbucks is that it buys “Not Fair Trade Coffee”. It means that it pays a very low price for its coffee that makes plantation workers to live in a poor condition. The second argument environmentalists used, is that Starbucks uses not organic milk for its latte. According to them the processed milk is related with cancer and is unhealthy. The third reason why greens attack Starbucks is that it uses genetically engineered products. However, the author thinks that Starbucks managers commit a mistake accepting the environmentalists’ demands because they are supported by inexact information and lies. I think that environmentalists are looking for a healthier life and enterprises that accept their requirements show their interest in human wealth. In this Starbucks example, the manager introduced some changes in their products because they were compatible with company’s values. Hence, the improvements they made should be accepted for their clients. However, I don’t agree with environmentalists to pressure an enterprise to sale only not genetically engineered products, because is the customer who should decide what does he want to buy and at what price.

After that, they decided to bring a good quality of coffee, because in the past the U.S. had awful coffee. They went to Europe to buy dark coffee which was very different from American coffee. They have began to open coffee shops in Seattle. Finally, Starbucks became very a popular coffee shop in the world and it now has 5,689 outlets in 28 countries. In my opinion, life has a lot of chances, but some people do not get them and some people get them like the Starbucks' owners. It was very a good idea to start a business with friends and to share with them information and experience. Also, any businesses now need money to start and they handle this problem by making business with three friends. Now, Starbucks has delicious coffee, and high quality coffee. Finally they have nice service and a popular coffee shop.

clueweb09-en0003-05-05751	"                    State 29         Keeping Track Of All Those Iowa Scandals While Remaining Insightfully Vulgar                         Saturday, June 21, 2008         Million Dollar Ripoff         From the Des Moines Register : A grocery industry group says a program that allows welfare recipients to shop at Iowa farmers markets with food stamps has cost taxpayers nearly $1 million over three years for less than $60,000 worth of fresh food. State officials acknowledge the numbers, but they say the cost also reflects indirect efforts to promote the entire food stamp program used by more than 255,000 people statewide. The issue about the farmers market costs arose from a disagreement over the state's effort to end a separate 7-cent subsidy grocers receive each time an electronic food stamp card is used. Iowa Department of Human Services officials have said the grocer subsidy, worth about $1 million per year, could be better spent. Right.  The Iowa Department of Human Services clearly wants to take that million dollars is pays to grocery stores for processing food stamps on their behalf and instead burn  even more money  ""marketing"" farmer's markets to people on food stamps. What a waste. State government in Iowa needs to be weeded.  No, it needs to be  destroyed .  Get the Roundup and start spraying.  Start with DHS.

Some men do not have birth locations listed because they registered on  the final draft registration day in 1918 when this information was not  recorded. Almost 24 million men registered for the draft -- not always  in the county of residence.
