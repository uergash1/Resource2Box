The primary innovation was the development of a network of small overlapping cell sites supported by a call switching infrastructure that tracks users as they moved through a network and pass their call from one site to another without dropping the connection. Bell Labs installed the first commercial cellular network in Chicago in the 1970s. [ 2 ]   Japan's first commercial mobile phone service was launched by  NTT  in 1978. By November 2007, the total number of mobile phone subscriptions in the world had reached 3.3 billion, or half of the human population (although some users have multiple subscriptions, or inactive subscriptions), which also makes the mobile phone the most widely spread technology and the most common electronic device in the world. [ 3 ]   The first mobile phone to enable internet connectivity and wireless email, the  Nokia Communicator , was released in 1996, creating a new category of multi-use devices called smartphones. In 1999 the first mobile internet service was launched by NTT DoCoMo in Japan under the i-Mode service. By 2007 over 798 million people around the world accessed the internet or equivalent mobile internet services such as WAP and i-Mode at least occasionally using a mobile phone rather than a personal computer.     [ edit ]   Cellular systems     See also:  Cellular frequencies     Mobile phones send and receive  radio  signals with any number of  cell site  base stations fitted with  microwave   antennas . These sites are usually mounted on a tower, pole or building, located throughout populated areas, then connected to a cabled communication network and switching system. The phones have a low-power  transceiver  that transmits voice and data to the nearest cell sites, normally not more than 8 to 13 km (approximately 5 to 8 miles) away.   When the mobile phone or data device is turned on, it registers with the  mobile telephone exchange , or switch, with its unique identifiers, and can then be alerted by the mobile switch when there is an incoming telephone call. The handset constantly listens for the strongest signal being received from the surrounding base stations, and is able to  switch seamlessly  between sites. As the user moves around the network, the "" handoffs "" are performed to allow the device to switch sites without interrupting the call.   Cell sites  have relatively low-power (often only one or two watts) radio transmitters which broadcast their presence and relay communications between the mobile handsets and the switch. The switch in turn connects the call to another subscriber of the same  wireless service provider  or to the  public telephone network , which includes the networks of other wireless carriers. Many of these sites are camouflaged to blend with existing environments, particularly in scenic areas.   The dialogue between the handset and the cell site is a stream of digital data that includes digitised audio (except for the first generation analog networks). The technology that achieves this depends on the system which the  mobile phone operator  has adopted. The technologies are grouped by generation. The first-generation systems started in 1979 with Japan, are all analog and include AMPS and NMT. Second-generation systems, started in 1991 in Finland, are all digital and include GSM, CDMA and TDMA.   The nature of cellular technology renders many phones vulnerable to 'cloning': anytime a cell phone moves out of  coverage  (for example, in a road tunnel), when the signal is re-established, the phone sends out a 're-connect' signal to the nearest cell-tower, identifying itself and signalling that it is again ready to transmit. With the proper equipment, it's possible to intercept the re-connect signal and encode the data it contains into a 'blank' phone -- in all respects, the 'blank' is then an exact duplicate of the real phone and any calls made on the 'clone' will be charged to the original account.   Third-generation (3G) networks, which are still being deployed, began in Japan in 2001. They are all digital, and offer high-speed data access in addition to voice services and include  W-CDMA  (known also as  UMTS ), and CDMA2000 EV-DO. China will launch a third generation technology on the TD-SCDMA standard. Operators use a mix of predesignated  frequency bands  determined by the network requirements and local regulations.   In an effort to limit the potential harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as  car phones  and  bag phones ) were limited to a maximum 3 watts  Effective Radiated Power . Modern  handheld  cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers be spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.   Some handhelds include an optional auxiliary antenna port on the back of the phone, which allows it to be connected to a large external antenna and a 3 watt cellular booster. Alternately in fringe-reception areas, a  cellular repeater  may be used, which uses a long distance high-gain  dish antenna  or  yagi antenna  to communicate with a cell tower far outside of normal range, and a repeater to rebroadcast on a small short-range local antenna that allows any cellphone within a few meters to function properly.     [ edit ]   Tariff models     See also:  GSM services#Voice charges     When cellular telecoms services were launched, phones and calls were very expensive and early mobile operators (carriers) decided to charge for all air time consumed by the mobile phone user. This resulted in the concept of charging callers for outbound calls and also for receiving calls. As mobile phone call charges diminished and phone adoption rates skyrocketed, more modern operators decided not to charge for incoming calls. Thus some markets have ""Receiving Party Pays"" models (also known as ""Mobile Party Pays""), in which both outbound and received calls are charged, and other markets have ""Calling Party Pays"" models, by which only making calls produces costs, and receiving calls is free. An exception to this is  international roaming tariffs , by which receiving calls are normally also charged. [ citation needed ]   The European market adopted a ""Calling Party Pays"" model throughout the GSM environment and soon various other GSM markets also started to emulate this model. As Receiving Party Pays systems have the undesired effect of phone owners keeping their phones turned off to avoid receiving unwanted calls, the total voice usage rates (and profits) in Calling Party Pays countries outperform those in Receiving Party Pays countries. [ citation needed ]  To avoid the problem of users keeping their phone turned off, most Receiving Party Pays countries have either switched to Calling Party Pays, or their carriers offer additional incentives such as a large number of monthly minutes at a sufficiently discounted rate to compensate for the inconvenience.   In most countries today, the person receiving a mobile phone call pays nothing. However, in  Hong Kong , Canada, and the United States, one can be charged per minute, for incoming as well as outgoing calls. In the United States and Canada, a few carriers are beginning to offer unlimited received phone calls. For the Chinese  mainland , it was reported that both of its two operators will adopt the caller-pays approach as early as January 2007. [ 4 ]   The asymmetry of Receiving Party Pays vs Calling Party Pays means a person in a RPP country (such as the US) calling a CPP country (e.g., Europe) pays both the calling charge and the receiving charge and the international toll, while the recipient pays nothing as usual. This is generally reflected in a significantly higher rate to mobile numbers (e.g., 25c/minute vs 3c/minute to a landline). Going the other way there is no difference in rate because the recipient pays the receiving charge. This can make people in CPP countries reluctant to call mobile numbers in RPP countries. There is further asymmetry in that an RPP user can choose a carrier with cheaper incoming minutes, while a CPP user cannot choose a carrier with cheaper RPP-to-CPP rates because these are quoted nationally rather than per carrier. This allows carriers in CPP countries to charge higher rates than would be tolerated in RPP countries.   While some systems of payment are  'pay-as-you-go'  where conversation time is purchased and added to a phone unit via an Internet account or in shops or ATMs, other systems are more traditional ones where bills are paid by regular intervals. Pay as you go (also known as ""pre-pay"") accounts were invented simultaneously in Portugal and Italy and today form more than half of all mobile phone subscriptions. USA, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan and Finland are among the rare countries left where most phones are still contract-based.   One possible alternative is a sim-lock free mobile phone. Sim-lock free mobile phones allow portability between networks so users can use sim cards from various networks and not need to have their phone unlocked.     [ edit ]   Impacts     [ edit ]   Human health and behaviour       Main article:  Mobile phone radiation and health       Since the introduction of mobile phones, concerns (both scientific and public) have been raised about the potential health impacts from regular use. [ 5 ]  But by 2008, American mobile phones transmitted and received more text messages than phone calls. [ 6 ]  Numerous studies have reported no significant relationship between mobile phone use and health, but the effect of mobile phone usage on health continues to be an area of public concern.   For example, at the request of some of their customers,  Verizon  created usage controls that meter service and can switch phones off, so that children could get some sleep. [ 6 ]  There have also been attempts to limit use by persons operating moving trains or automobiles, coaches when writing to potential players on their teams, and movie theater audiences. [ 6 ]  By one measure, nearly 40% of automobile drivers aged 16 to 30 years old text while driving, and by another, 40% of teenagers said they could text blindfolded. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Mobile phone dermatitis   According to  Reuters , The British Association of Dermatologists is warning of a rash occurring on peoples ears or cheeks caused by an allergic reaction from the  nickel  surface commonly found on mobile devices exteriors. There is also a theory it could even occur on the fingers if someone spends a lot of time  text messaging  on metal menu buttons. Earlier this year Lionel Bercovitch of  Brown University  in  Providence ,  Rhode Island , and colleagues tested 22 popular handsets from eight different manufacturers and found nickel on 10 of the devices. [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Safety concerns   As of 2007, several airlines are experimenting with base station and antenna systems installed to the aeroplane, allowing low power, short-range connection of any phones aboard to remain connected to the aircraft's base station. [ 8 ]  Thus, they would not attempt connection to the ground base stations as during take off and landing. [ citation needed ]  Simultaneously, airlines may offer phone services to their travelling passengers either as full voice and data services, or initially only as SMS text messaging and similar services. The Australian airline  Qantas  is the first airline to run a test aeroplane in this configuration in the autumn of 2007. [ citation needed ]   Emirates  has announced plans to allow limited mobile phone usage on some flights. [ citation needed ]  However, in the past, commercial airlines have prevented the use of cell phones and laptops, due to the assertion that the frequencies emitted from these devices may disturb the radio waves contact of the airplane.   On March 20, 2008, an Emirates flight was the first time voice calls have been allowed in-flight on commercial airline flights. The breakthrough came after the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the United Arab Emirates-based General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA) granted full approval for the AeroMobile system to be used on Emirates. Passengers were able to make and receive voice calls as well as use text messaging. The system automatically came into operation as the Airbus A340-300 reached cruise altitude. Passengers wanting to use the service received a text message welcoming them to the AeroMobile system when they first switched their phones on. The approval by EASA has established that GSM phones are safe to use on airplanes, as the AeroMobile system does not require the modification of aircraft components deemed ""sensitive,"" nor does it require the use of modified phones.   In any case, there are inconsistencies between practices allowed by different airlines and even on the same airline in different countries. For example,  Northwest Airlines  may allow the use of mobile phones immediately after landing on a domestic flight within the US, whereas they may state ""not until the doors are open"" on an international flight arriving in the Netherlands. In April 2007 the US  Federal Communications Commission  officially prohibited passengers' use of cell phones during a flight. [ 9 ]   In a similar vein, signs are put up in many countries, such as Canada, the UK and the U.S., at  petrol stations  prohibiting the use of mobile phones, due to possible safety issues. [ citation needed ]   18 studies have been conducted on the link between cell phones and brain cancer; A review of these studies found that cell phone use of 10 years or more ""give a consistent pattern of an increased risk for acoustic neuroma and glioma"" [ 10 ] . The tumors are found mostly on the side of the head that the mobile phone is in contact with. In July 2008, Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, warned about the radiation from mobile phones. He stated that there was no definitive proof of the link between mobile phones and brain tumors but there was enough studies that mobile phone usage should be reduced as a precaution [ 11 ] . Studies are also being done on children and how mobile phone radiation affects their brains. When children start using mobile phones at a young age, they will have more years to deal with mobile phone radiation than adults will who started using mobile phones at a later age. Also, childrens brains are still developing and radiation can affect the growth of the brain easier than adults. Brains of children under 8 years of age, in fact, absorb three times the amount of radiation that adults brains do. To reduce the amount of radiation being absorbed hands free devices can be used or texting could supplement calls. Calls could also be shortened or limit mobile phone usage in rural areas. Radiation is found to be higher in areas that are located away from mobile phone towers [ 12 ] .     [ edit ]   Etiquette   Most schools in the  United States  and  Europe  and  Canada  have prohibited mobile phones in the classroom, or in school due to the large number of class disruptions that result from their use, and the potential for cheating via text messaging [ citation needed ] . In the UK, possession of a mobile phone in an examination can result in immediate disqualification from that subject or from all that student's subjects. This still applies even if the mobile phone was not turned on at the time. The  JCQ  also requires schools to display notices of the unauthorised use of mobiles, on both the inside and outside of exam rooms.  [ 13 ] . Mobile phones can also be used for bullying and threats to other students, or displaying inappropriate material in school.   A working group made up of Finnish telephone companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users of courtesy, especially when using mass transitwhat to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters. [ 14 ]   Many US cities with subway transit systems underground are studying or have implemented mobile phone reception in their underground tunnels for their riders. Boston, Massachusetts has investigated such usage in their tunnels, although there is a question of usage etiquette and also how to fairly award contracts to carriers. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   The issue of mobile communication and etiquette has also become an issue of academic interest. The rapid adoption of the device has resulted in the intrusion of telephony into situations where it was previously not used. This has exposed the implicit rules of courtesy and opened them to reevaluation. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Use by drivers       Main articles:  Mobile phones and driving safety  and  Handsfree       The use of mobile phones by people who are driving has become increasingly common, either as part of their job, as in the case of delivery drivers who are calling a client, or by commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as  Australia , the Canadian provinces of  Quebec ,  Ontario ,  Nova Scotia , and  Newfoundland and Labrador  as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England,  Wales , and  Northern Ireland . Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of  road traffic accidents .   Studies have found vastly different  relative risks  (RR). Two separate studies using case-crossover analysis each calculated RR at 4, [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  while an epidemiological  cohort study  found RR, when adjusted for crash-risk exposure, of 1.11 for men and 1.21 for women. [ 20 ]   A simulation study from the  University of Utah  Professor David Strayer compared drivers with a  blood alcohol content  of 0.08% to those conversing on a cell phone, and after controlling for driving difficulty and time on task, the study concluded that cell phone drivers exhibited greater impairment than intoxicated drivers.  [ 21 ]  Meta-analysis by The  Canadian Automobile Association [ 22 ]  and The  University of Illinois [ 23 ]  found that response time while using both hands-free and hand-held phones was approximately 0.5  standard deviations  higher than normal driving (i.e., an average driver, while talking on a cell phone, has response times of a driver in roughly the 40th percentile).   Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than driving while using a hand-held phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]  epidemiological studies, [ 20 ]  simulation studies, [ 21 ]  and meta-analysis [ 22 ] [ 23 ] . Even with this information,  California  recently passed a cell phone law that requires drivers who are 18 years of age or older to use a hands-free device while using the phone in the vehicle. Moreover, this law also restricts drivers under the age of 18 from using a mobile phone. This law went into effect on July 1, 2008 with a $20 fine for the first offense and $50 fines for each subsequent conviction. The consistency of increased crash risk between hands-free and hand-held phone use is at odds with legislation in over 30 countries that prohibit hand-held phone use but allow hands-free. Scientific literature is mixed on the dangers of talking on a phone versus those of talking with a passenger, with the Accident Research Unit at the  University of Nottingham  finding that the number of utterances was usually higher for mobile calls when compared to blindfolded and non-blindfolded passengers, [ 24 ]  but the  University of Illinois  meta-analysis concluding that passenger conversations were just as costly to driving performance as cell phone ones. [ 23 ]     [ edit ]   Environmental impacts          Cellular antenna disguised to look like a tree       Like all high structures, cellular antenna masts pose a hazard to low flying  aircraft . Towers over a certain height or towers that are close to  airports  or  heliports  are normally required to have  warning lights . There have been reports that warning lights on cellular masts, TV-towers and other high structures can attract and confuse  birds . US authorities estimate that millions of birds are killed near communication towers in the country each year. [ 25 ]   Some cellular antenna towers have been camouflaged to make them less obvious on the horizon, and make them look more like a tree.   An example of the way mobile phones and mobile networks have sometimes been perceived as a threat is the widely reported and later discredited claim that mobile phone masts are associated with the  Colony Collapse Disorder  (CCD) which has reduced bee hive numbers by up to 75% in many areas, especially near cities in the US. The Independent newspaper cited a scientific study claiming it provided evidence for the theory that mobile phone masts  are  a major cause in the collapse of bee populations, with controlled experiments demonstrating a rapid and catastrophic effect on individual hives near masts. [ 26 ]  Mobile phones were in fact not covered in the study, and the original researchers have since emphatically disavowed any connection between their research, mobile phones, and CCD, specifically indicating that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created ""a horror story"". [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ]  While the initial claim of damage to bees was widely reported, the corrections to the story were almost non-existent in the media.     See also:  Electronic waste     There are more than 500 million used mobile phones in the US sitting on shelves or in landfills  [ 30 ] , and it is estimated that over 125 million will be discarded this year alone.  [ 31 ]  The problem is growing at a rate of more than two million phones per week, putting tons of toxic waste into landfills daily. Several companies offer to buy back and recycle mobile phones from users. In the United States many unwanted but working mobile phones are donated to women's shelters to allow emergency communication.     [ edit ]   Usage     [ edit ]   By civilians          This Railfone found on some  Amtrak  trains in North America uses cellular technology.         See also:  List of mobile network operators     An increasing number of countries, particularly in Europe, now have more mobile phones than people. According to the figures from Eurostat, the European Union's in-house statistical office,  Luxembourg  had the highest  mobile phone penetration rate  at 158 mobile subscriptions per 100 people, closely followed by  Lithuania  and Italy. [ 32 ]  In  Hong Kong  the penetration rate reached 139.8% of the population in July 2007. [ 33 ]  Over 50 countries have mobile phone subscription penetration rates higher than that of the population and the Western European average penetration rate was 110% in 2007 (source Informa 2007). Canada currently has the lowest rates of mobile phone penetrations in the industrialised world at 58%.   There are over five hundred million active mobile phone accounts in China, as of 2007, but the total penetration rate there still stands below 50%. [ 34 ]  The total number of mobile phone subscribers in the world was estimated at 2.14 billion in 2005. [ 35 ]  The subscriber count reached 2.7 billion by end of 2006 according to Informa [ citation needed ] , and 3.3 billion by November, 2007 [ 3 ] , thus reaching an equivalent of over half the planet's population. Around 80% of the world's population has access to mobile phone coverage, as of 2006. This figure is expected to increase to 90% by the year 2010. [ 36 ]   In some  developing countries  with little ""landline"" telephone  infrastructure , mobile phone use has quadrupled in the last decade. [ 37 ]  The rise of mobile phone technology in developing countries is often cited as an example of the  leapfrog effect . Many remote regions in the third world went from having no telecommunications infrastructure to having satellite based communications systems. At present, Africa has the largest growth rate of cellular subscribers in the world, [ 38 ]  its markets expanding nearly twice as fast as Asian markets. [ 39 ]  The availability of  prepaid  or  'pay-as-you-go'  services, where the subscriber is not committed to a long term contract, has helped fuel this growth in Africa as well as in other continents.   On a numerical basis, India is the largest growth market, adding about 6 million mobile phones every month. [ 40 ]  With 256.55 million total landline and mobile phones, market penetration in the country is still low at 22.52%. India expects to reach 500 million subscribers by the end of 2010. Simultaneously, landline phone ownership is decreasing gradually and accounts for approximately 40 million connections.   There are three major technical standards for the current generation of mobile phones and networks, and two major standards for the next generation 3G phones and networks. All European and African countries and many Asian countries have adopted a single system,  GSM , which is the only technology available on all continents and in most countries and covers over 74% of all subscribers on mobile networks. In many countries, such as the United States, Australia,  Brazil , Canada,  Costa Rica , India,, South Korea, and  Vietnam , GSM co-exists with other internationally adopted standards such as  CDMA  and TDMA, as well as national standards such as  iDEN  in the USA and PDC in Japan. Over the past five years several dozen mobile operators (carriers) have abandoned networks on TDMA and CDMA technologies, switching over to GSM.   With third generation (3G) networks, which are also known as IMT-2000 networks, about three out of four networks are on the  W-CDMA  (also known as  UMTS ) standard, usually seen as the natural evolution path for GSM and TDMA networks. One in four 3G networks is on the CDMA2000 1x EV-DO technology. Some analysts count a previous stage in CDMA evolution, CDMA2000 1x RTT, as a 3G technology whereas most standardization experts count only CDMA2000 1x EV-DO as a true 3G technology. Because of this difference in interpreting what is 3G, there is a wide variety in subscriber counts. As of June 2007, on the narrow definition there are 200 million subscribers on 3G networks. By using the more broad definition, the total subscriber count of 3G phone users is 475 million.     [ edit ]   Culture and customs          Cellular phones allow people to communicate from almost anywhere at their leisure.       Between the 1980s and the 2000s, the mobile phone has gone from being an expensive item used by the business elite to a pervasive, personal communications tool for the general population. In most countries, mobile phones outnumber land-line phones, with fixed landlines numbering 1.3 billion but mobile subscriptions 3.3 billion at the end of 2007.   In many markets from Japan and South Korea , to Scandinavia, to Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, most children age 8-9 have mobile phones and the new accounts are now opened for customers aged 6 and 7. Where mostly parents tend to give hand-me-down used phones to their youngest children, in Japan already new cameraphones are on the market whose target age group is under 10 years of age, introduced by KDDI in February 2007. The USA also lags on this measure, as in the US so far, about half of all children have mobile phones. [ 41 ]  In many  young adults ' households it has supplanted the land-line phone. Mobile phone usage is banned in some countries, such as  North Korea  and restricted in some other countries such as  Burma . [ 42 ]   Given the high levels of societal mobile phone service penetration, it is a key means for people to communicate with each other. The  SMS  feature spawned the "" texting "" sub-culture amongst younger users. In December 1993, the first person-to-person SMS text message was transmitted in Finland. Currently, texting is the most widely used data service; 1.8 billion users generated $80 billion of revenue in 2006 (source ITU). Many phones offer  Instant Messenger  services for simple, easy texting. Mobile phones have Internet service (e.g.  NTT DoCoMo 's  i-mode ), offering text messaging via e-mail in Japan, South Korea, China, and India. Most mobile internet access is much different from computer access, featuring alerts, weather data, e-mail, search engines, instant messages, and game and music downloading; most mobile internet access is hurried and short.   The mobile phone can be a  fashion   totem  custom-decorated to reflect the owner's personality. [ 43 ]  This aspect of the mobile telephony business is, in itself, an industry, e.g.  ringtone  sales amounted to $3.5 billion in 2005. [ 44 ]          The use of a mobile phone is prohibited in some train company carriages       Mobile phone use can be an important matter of social discourtesy: phones ringing during funerals or weddings; in toilets, cinemas and theatres. Some  book shops ,  libraries ,  bathrooms ,  cinemas , doctors' offices and  places of worship  prohibit their use, so that other patrons will not be disturbed by conversations. Some facilities install  signal-jamming equipment  to prevent their use, although in many countries, including the US, such equipment is illegal. Some new  auditoriums  have installed wire mesh in the walls to make a  Faraday cage , which prevents signal penetration without violating signal jamming laws. [ citation needed ]   Trains, particularly those involving long-distance services, often offer a ""quiet carriage"" where phone use is prohibited, much like the designated non-smoking carriage of the past. In the UK however many users tend to ignore this as it is rarely enforced, especially if the other carriages are crowded and they have no choice but to go in the ""quiet carriage"". [ citation needed ]  In Japan, it is generally considered impolite to talk using a phone on any train -- e-mailing is generally the mode of mobile communication. Mobile phone usage on local  public transport  is also increasingly seen as a nuisance; the city of  Graz , for instance, has mandated a total ban of mobile phones on its tram and bus network in 2008 (though texting and emailing is still allowed). [ 45 ] [ 46 ]   Mobile phone use on aircraft  is starting to be allowed with several airlines already offering the ability to use phones during flights. Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics; the concern is partially based on the crash of  Crossair Flight 498 . The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even on planes that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.     [ edit ]   By government agencies     [ edit ]   Law enforcement       Main article:  Lawful interception       Law enforcement have used mobile phone evidence in a number of different ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual at a given time can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over  terrorism  and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the  British House of Commons   Home Affairs Select Committee  into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. [ 47 ]  NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101. [ 48 ]   In the UK in 2000 it was claimed that recordings of mobile phone conversations made on the day of the  Omagh bombing  were crucial to the police investigation. In particular, calls made on two mobile phones which were tracked from south of the Irish border to Omagh and back on the day of the bombing, were considered of vital importance. [ 49 ]   Further example of criminal investigations using mobile phones is the initial location and ultimate identification of the terrorists of the  2004 Madrid train bombings . In the attacks, mobile phones had been used to detonate the bombs. However, one of the bombs failed to detonate, and the  SIM  card in the corresponding mobile phone gave the first serious lead about the terrorists to investigators. By tracking the whereabouts of the SIM card and correlating other mobile phones that had been registered in those areas, police were able to locate the terrorists. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Disaster response   The Finnish government decided in 2005 that the fastest way to warn citizens of disasters was the mobile phone network. In Japan, mobile phone companies provide  immediate notification  of  earthquakes  and other  natural disasters  to their customers free of charge  [ 51 ] . In the event of an emergency,  disaster response  crews can locate trapped or injured people using the signals from their mobile phones. An interactive menu accessible through the phone's  Internet browser  notifies the company if the user is safe or in distress. [ citation needed ]  In Finland rescue services suggest hikers carry mobile phones in case of emergency even when deep in the forests beyond  cellular coverage , as the radio signal of a cellphone attempting to connect to a base station can be detected by overflying rescue aircraft with special detection gear. Also, users in the United States can sign up through their provider for free text messages when an  AMBER Alert  goes out for a missing person in their area.   However, most mobile phone networks operate close to capacity during normal times and spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the system just when it is needed the most. Examples reported in the media where this have occurred include the  September 11, 2001 attacks , the  2003 Northeast blackouts , the  2005 London Tube bombings ,  Hurricane Katrina , the  2006 Hawaii earthquake , and the  2007 Minnesota bridge collapse .   Under FCC regulations, all mobile telephones must be capable of dialing  emergency telephone numbers , regardless of the presence of a SIM card or the payment status of the account.

It was originally known as the  Atari VCS , for  V ideo  C omputer  S ystem , and the name ""Atari 2600"" was first used in  1982 , after the release of the more advanced  Atari 5200 . The 2600 was typically bundled with two  joystick  controllers and a cartridge game.      [ Top ]  History    [ Top ]  Development and market considerations    Atari  had spun off an engineering think-tank in 1975 called Cyan Engineering to research next-generation video game systems, and had been working on a prototype known as ""Stella"" (named after one of the engineer's bicycles) for some time. Unlike prior generations of machines which used custom logic to play a small number of games, Stella was essentially a combination of a complete  CPU , the famous  6502  in a cut-down version, combined with a display and sound chip of their own design known as the  TIA , for  T elevision  I nterface  A daptor . At first the design was not going to be cartridge based, but after seeing a ""fake"" cartridge system on another machine they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.  In August 1976  Fairchild Semiconductor  released their own cartridge based system basically ""out of the blue"", the  Channel F . Stella was still not ready for production, but it was clear that it needed to be before there were a number of ""me too"" products filling up the market – which had happened after they invented  PONG . Atari simply didn't have the cash flow to complete the system quickly, given that sales of their own PONG systems were cooling.  Nolan Bushnell  eventually turned to  Warner Communications , and sold the company to them in  1976  for $28 million on the promise that Stella would be productized as soon as possible.  Key to the eventual success of the machine was the hiring of  Jay Miner , a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire breadboard of equipment making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged the system was ready for shipping.  By the time it was released in  1977 , the development had cost about US$100 million.    [ Top ]  Launch and runaway success    The initial price was $199 with a library of 6 titles. In a play to compete directly with the Channel F, Atari named the machine VCS, as the Channel F was at that point known as the  VES , for  Video Entertainment System . When Fairchild learned of Atari's naming they quicky changed their unit to become the Channel F. However both units were now in the midst of the  video game crash of 1977 ; PONG clones faced with the extinction of their market due to these newer and more powerful machines simply dumped their boxes for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari were selling to a public that were completely burnt out on PONG. In 1977 Atari sold only 250,000 VCS's, 550,000 in 1978 but from a production run of 800,000 which led to massive debt, requiring further support from Warner. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari founder  Nolan Bushnell  to leave the company in  1978 .  Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than PONG, and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the 2600 gained popularity. Fairchild had by this point given up, thinking they were a passed fad, thereby handing the entire quickly growing market to Atari. By  1979 , the 2600 was the best selling  Christmas  present (and console), mainly because of its exclusive content, and a million were sold that year.  Atari then licensed the smash  arcade  hit  Space Invaders  by  Taito , which greatly increased the unit's popularity when it was released in May  1980 , doubling sales again to over 2 million units. The 2600 and its cartridges were the main factor behind Atari grossing more than $2 billion in profits in 1980. Sales then doubled again for the next two years, with almost 8 million units selling in 1982.    [ Top ]  Growth pains and decline    During this period Atari continued to grow until it had one of the largest  R&D  divisions in  Silicon Valley . They spent much of their R&D budget on projects that seemed rather out of place at a videogame, or even home computer, company, projects many of which never saw the light of day. Meanwhile several attempts to bring out newer consoles failed for one reason or another, although their  home computer  systems, the  Atari 8-bit family  sold reasonably if not spectacularily. Warner was more than happy anyway, as it seemed to have no end to the sales of the 2600, and Atari was responsible for over half of the company's income.    The programmers of many of Atari's biggest hits grew disgruntled with the company for not crediting game developers. For example, Rick Mauer, the programmer of Atari 2600  Space Invaders , received no credit and made only $11,000 for his efforts, in spite of the cartridge grossing more than $100 million in sales. Some programmers hid their names in obscure places in the game (a practice known as "" Easter eggs "", which continues in software development to this day), but many left the company and formed their own independent software companies. The most prominent and longest-lasting of these third-party developers was  Activision , founded in 1980, whose titles quickly became more popular than those of Atari itself. Atari attempted to block third-party development for the 2600 in court but failed, and soon other publishers, such as Imagic and  Coleco  entered the market.  Atari suffered from image problems when the Mystique company produced a number of pornographic games for the 2600.  The most notorious of these,  Custer's Revenge  caused a large number of protests from women's groups and  Native American  groups.  Atari then sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.  Atari continued to scoop up licenses during the shelf life of the 2600, the most prominent of which included  Pac-Man  and  E.T. (video game) . Public disappointment with these latter two titles is sometimes cited as a big reason for the  video game crash of 1983 . Suddenly Atari's growth meant it was losing massive amounts of money during the crash, at one point about $10,000 a day. Warner quickly grew tired of supporting the now-headless company, and started looking for buyers in  1984 .    [ Top ]  The console that refused to die    Although not formally discontinued, the 2600 was de-emphasized for two years after Warner's 1984 sale of Atari to  Commodore International  founder  Jack Tramiel , who wanted to concentrate on  home computers . A new version of the 2600 was released in  1986  in a smaller, cost-reduced form factor with a modernized  Atari 7800 -like appearance, along with a resurgence in software development both from Atari and from third parties. The Atari 2600 continued to sell in the USA and Europe until  1989 , and continued to sell in  PAL  version in Asian nations until the early 1990s. Over its lifetime, an estimated 25 million units were shipped, and its  video game library  reportedly numbers more than 900 titles.  At the turn of the millennium, 25 years+ after the launch of the Atari 2600, new video games are still made for it by hobbyists, and the console and its old and new games are very popular with collectors because of its significant impact on video game and consumer electronics history and also due to its nostalgic value for many people. In addition, modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. One example is the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by Jakks Pacific, which simulates, more or less accurately, the basic electronics of the 2600 console, and includes ROMs from 10 cartridges, into a single Atari-brand-look-a-like joystick with  composite video  outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs.    [ Top ] Description    The basic layout of the 2600 is fairly similar to most consoles and home computers of the era. The CPU was the  MOS Technology 6507 , a cut-down version of the 6502, running at 1.19  MHz  in the 2600.  The 6507 included less memory pins — 13 instead of 16 — to fit into a smaller 28-pin package.  Smaller packaging was, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, and since memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8  KB  memory space wasn't going to be used up anyway. In fact memory was so expensive they couldn't imagine using up even 4K, and when they got a deal on 24-pin connectors for the cartridge socket, they were only too happy to thereby limit the games to 4K. ¹  The console had 128  bytes  of  RAM  (working storage) that was used by the system to store game state data, i.e. data identifying where the player was in the game, what the score was, etc. RAM was so expensive that there was simply no way to have a ""screen buffer"", a portion of memory that holds the pattern to be drawn to the screen, at least not with the  resolution  they wanted. Instead they decided to have enough memory for only one line of the display at a time, when the TV completed drawing that line, the game was expected to quickly stuff the next line into the TIA while the TV was resetting for the next line.  This is part of the reason that black lines can be seen on the left side of the screen when playing 2600 games.   It was a side-effect of this system, known to 2600 programmers as  racing the beam , that made the 2600 one of the most complex machines in the world to program. Nevertheless it was that same complexity that actually made the system incredibly flexible, and when authors discovered the ""tricks"" the games soon started to gain in power far beyond what the original designers had ever imagined.  The computers in most homes  today  are much more powerful than the 2600.  The CPU of a typical  PC  for home use today is  clocked  at more than 1 GHz, or roughly 1000 times the 1.19 MHz clock rate of the 2600.  Also, the 2600's CPU processed 8 bits of data per ""clock tick"", while modern PC CPUs handle 32 or more bits per (much faster) tick. Most computers today have 256  megabytes  or more of RAM, which is 2,097,152 times the amount of RAM in the 2600. Also, the Atari had no on board  secondary storage , whereas such storage in the form of  hard disk  drives on today's systems will often have a capacity of 100  GB  or so.  (¹ The cartridge connector's 24 pins were allocated to one supply voltage line, two ground lines, 8 data lines, and 13 address lines. However, the uppermost address line was used as a so-called  chip select  for the cartridge's ROM chip, leaving only 12 address lines for the chip's game program.

CB103055         SOLD OUT             Best Electronics has been  selling to Atari 520ST / 1040ST / 1040STE / Mega / MegaSTE / TT and Falcon  Owners and using the Excellent Atari ST HDDRIVER 8 Software Package in house to  prepare All of the Atari ST / Falcon Hard Drives we have sold for near 10 years  now.  It has been our Bench mark ST Hard Drive prep program.  Compared  to the original Atari HD ST Hard Drive program  (has not  been updated or supported for 8 - 10 years now)  and the Old Bench mark  ICD Hard Drive prep Software  (has not been updated or  supported for at least 5 to 7 years) , the HDDRIVER 8 has gone thru  constant upgrades and updates over the last 10 years.  I think when we  first starting to sell the HDDRIVER 7 program years ago, it was on Rev. 7.0  version and currently version is Rev. 8.16.  The German HDDRIVER 8 author  has constantly updated this excellent Hard Drive prep program from the very  first very small Atari Megafile 20 Meg Hard Drives and small SCSI TT Hard drives  to the State of the art Giga Byte very large Hard Drives sold today.    Every time something new came out for the Atari ST computers, including some of  the ST updated Clones and ST /  Falcon Accelerator boards, the HDDRIVER 8  program was upgraded to support these new St products / New Hard Drives.   One of the reasons why we  like the HDDRIVER 8 hard drive program so much, is it is a  very easy to  use ST program and has one of the fastest auto boot up ST hard drive programs we  have seen.  In the 10 years of using the program in house we have only had  one or two Non Atari made hard drive mechs we could not format, I think they had  a defect on the hard drive motherboards.  With its easy to use intuitive  drop down GEM menus, a beginner who had never even formatted an Atari ST Hard  Drive to the Atari ST Hard Drive expert who likes to set his own Hard Drive  internal settings will find the HDDRIVER 8 program Very easy to use.  In  the past years the HDDRIVER program was supplied with a Owners Manual, now has  an on board Read Me file on the 3 1/2 ST Disk and there is    Now     Free   On Line Internet Support and Information in English for Registered HDDRIVER 8  Owners at the HDDRIVER 8 web site in Germany.        CB103057     $49.95      Atari 520ST/520STFM/1040ST/Mega 2 - 4/Stacy/MegaSTE/TT External SCSI Hard Drive!

clueweb09-enwp01-48-15630	"                     Optimus Maximus keyboard          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Oled keyboard )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article's  factual accuracy  may be compromised due to out-of-date information . Please help  improve the article  by updating it. There may be information on the  talk page .       The  Optimus Maximus keyboard , previously just ""Optimus keyboard"", is a  keyboard  developed by the  Art. Lebedev Studio , a Russian design studio headed by  Artemy Lebedev . Each of its keys is a  display  which can dynamically change to adapt to the  keyboard layout  in use or to show the function of the key. Pre-orders began on  20 May   2007  for a limited production run from December 2007 to January 2008, with a second batch expected to arrive in February 2008. It first started shipping the week of February 21, 2008.           Contents       1   Overview     1.1   Optimus mini three   1.2   Optimus Aux   1.3   Production schedule   1.4   Variations       2   Similar keyboards   3   Special features   4   Reviews   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Overview           Photoshop  layout (Mac, prototype rendering)               Quake III Arena  layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering.       The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on  Slashdot  on  14 July   2005 , and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was ""end of 2006"", however production issues caused the  Optimus mini three  to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the  Wired Magazine  2006  Vaporware Awards [ 1 ]  and number 4 on the list in 2007 [ 2 ]  due to its numerous delays and feature reductions.   The Optimus allows for greater  user interaction , by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the  shift key , the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as  English  and  Cyrillic ) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as  Dvorak  easier for people who only have a  QWERTY  keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for  Quake III Arena  and  Adobe Photoshop .   A newly-revealed (as of January 3, 2008) patent application filed on March 13, 2007 suggests that  Apple Inc.  may be working on a similar dynamically changeable OLED keyboard. [ 3 ] [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus mini three   Main article:  Optimus mini three   Art. Lebedev Studio has released a smaller three-key version of their keyboard, named  Optimus mini three . Each of the keys is larger than a standard key. The mini three can be adjusted, through the configuration software, to either a horizontal or vertical orientation.   Initial reviews have been mixed. The keyboard functions as advertised, but it has been criticized for inordinately high CPU usage, slow response time, and buggy configuration software. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Optimus Aux   On  July 21 ,  2008 ,  Engadget  posted about a new version of the keyboard, named Optimus Pultius. It features 15 OLED keys in a three-by-five arrangement and a USB port. It is expected to be released in late 2008 or early 2009. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On  September 19 , 2008, Engadget also reported that the Pultius had been renamed to the Aux [ 8 ]  and included a new rendering of the rear side showing that there would be two USB ports instead of one. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Production schedule   Some reports indicate that the keyboards started shipping on February 21, 2008. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Variations   Variations with fewer OLED keys will also be available, each upgradeable by replacing static keys with OLED keys after purchase. For keyboards with less than a full complement of OLED ""active keys"", additional keys can be purchased and installed. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Similar keyboards   The patent for this ""Display Keyboard"" ( U.S. Patent 5,818,361   ) is held by inventor Elkin Acevedo. [1]  However, the first programmable LCD keyboard  [2]  was developed in the mid-1980s in Germany. This keyboard, sold under the LCBoard name in the U.S. until 1999, contained many of the features of the Optimus keyboard including monochrome graphic icons on each keyboard key, macro programming, context sensitive and application dependent switching between functions.     [ edit ]   Special features   Art. Lebedev Studio is expecting to manufacture the keyboard with these features: [3]     A plastic body (width: 537 mm, depth: 173 mm, height: 38 mm)   Extra-durable  polymer   plastic  keys (20.220.2 mm, visible area 10.110.1 mm)   4848  pixel  screens,  Highcolor  mode (65 536 colors, 10 FPS)   OLED  (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen for keys   USB 2.0  (or 1.1) connectivity   4-5 year lifetime   A  key-saver  mode   Support for animation on keys at 10  FPS  minimum   Ability to form a mosaic using a combination of key images   Compatibility with  Windows XP ,  Windows Vista  and  Mac OS X  10.5.1 (and higher).   An  SDK  for complete display customization   Swappable keys and support for keys without displays   32  MB   SD card  for storing basic layouts   Non-stop glow time at nominal brightness of 20,000 hours, after which display quality will diminish   An ambient light sensor which can be used to automatically adjust display brightness   A  viewing angle  of 160       [ edit ]   Reviews   Engadget  has published early impressions of the keyboard, approving of the quality of the displays, the build quality of the keyboard, and the customisation software. However, they note that the keys' high resistance means that it is tiring to type on (exhausting the author in ""30 seconds to a minute""), and therefore ""it's better off used as an absurdly configurable Swiss army knife"".
