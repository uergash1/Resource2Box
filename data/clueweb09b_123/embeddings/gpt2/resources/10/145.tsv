History  |   Work Portfolio  |  Highlights  |  Volpe Subsites  |  Journal Articles           Mobility History      From long distance air trips to local errands, Americans everywhere are on the move. The DOT has always recognized that mobility and accessibility are central functions of our transportation system.     The Volpe Center has supported DOT's efforts to ensure that the transportation system is accessible, integrated, efficient, and offers flexibility of choices. The Center's work on improving access to transportation can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s and continues today. The Center has been involved in efforts to improve mass transit and has demonstrated an expertise in evaluating innovative technologies. As the demand for air transportation has increased, the Center has provided the aviation community with forward-thinking support for modernization. The Center's innovative approach is demonstrated by its involvement with new and ""intelligent"" technologies to meet transportation demands.     Access for all Americans    Over the last 30 years there has been a welcome change in the national consciousness. Society now recognizes the importance of providing access to transportation for all citizens. As the population ages, there is a raised  awareness of the needs of the elderly and the desirability of providing them with viable transportation alternatives to the automobile. Many people live in the suburbs or in rural areas, which are not served by public transportation. People who used to be on welfare are now entering the work force. How can job accessibility be provided for these new workers and other low-income workers who often rely on public transport and must undertake hazarduous and complex journeys each day to get to work? How can access to transit for the disabled be improved? These are important national concerns.    The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act guarantees equal opportunity for individuals with disabilities. Removing barriers allows society to benefit more from the abilities and talents of disabled people. Since 1991, the Volpe Center has supported the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in implementing the transit-related requirements of this act. The Center's work has included technical reviews of paratransit plans, research and technology assessments, technical assistance and outreach products, and fact-finding site investigations.     In the 1970s and 1980s the FTA was already looking at ways to improve access to transit for disabled people and to encourage other innovations. The Volpe Center supported the FTA by conducting evaluations of ridesharing demonstration programs and studying paratransit systems such as dial-a-ride. Dial-a-ride transit is an on-demand service. Customers telephone their trip requests in advance to a dispatching center. Most riders live in low-density areas not served by fixed-route transit, but dial-a-ride transit may also serve elderly or disabled customers. Transit agencies have sought to increase the efficiency of dial-a-ride transit through the use of automated vehicle routing that would increase the number of riders per trip. Recently, the Volpe Center developed a system concept that uses off-the-shelf communications software to further automation. Known as Autonomous Dial-A-Ride-Transit (ADART), the technology provides on-board computers that decentralize and automate the dispatching function. Center researchers are working on a demonstration program in Corpus Christi, Texas.     The Volpe Center's work on increasing access to transportation has included evaluating how well transit systems meet the mobility needs of welfare recipients who must rely on public transportation to travel to their jobs. In support of DOT's Access to Jobs program, researchers at the Center used Geographic Information System technologies to correlate availability of transportation with the geographic distribution of people most in need of these services. This has enabled planners to determine the best means to provide job accessibility for welfare recipients and other low-income residents.     The Volpe Center also is conducting research on viable transportation alternatives for the nation's aging population. This research will enable policy makers to open a dialogue on how the transportation community provides mobility and access to that increasing portion of the nation's population who no longer can or want to operate an automobile.    Improvements to Mass Transit    The Volpe Center's support for the FTA started in the 1970s when it conducted evaluations of potential improvements to existing transit operations and technology.    Could ramps and lifts accommodate the needs of disabled riders? Was the introduction of reserved lanes for buses and carpools effective in lowering trip times? Were double-decker buses a viable option for increasing capacity on heavily traveled routes in major urban areas? As the FTA grappled with these and other issues, the Center developed an expertise in helping the agency evaluate new technologies and services. Working primarily to support the FTA's Service and Methods Demonstration Program, the Center continued to perform these evaluations in the 1970s and 1980s and thus established its reputation as an impartial technical resource.    Building on this work, the Volpe Center conducted evaluations of more advanced and innovative technologies for urban transit. The Center performed assessments of Automated Guideway transit systems and supported the implementation of a Personal Rapid Transit system that used driverless vehicles to connect campuses at the University of West Virginia in Morgantown. The Center was then able to provide the FTA with guidance when FTA launched the Downtown People Mover Project, through which driverless vehicles operated over exclusive guideways, in congested downtown areas such as Los Angeles, St. Paul, Detroit, and Miami. The technical guidance included engineering evaluations, advice on supplier selection, and a socioeconomic assessment of the program.     Air Transport Efficiency    The nation's air traffic continues to increase dramatically. In 1970, 170 million people traveled the world's airways. By 1999, that figure had grown to 635 million people. As demand for air transportation has increased, a number of problems--from insufficient capacity to delays--have arisen. That there is no one solution is demonstrated by the range of projects where the Volpe Center has worked with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to increase airport capacity and to minimize delays and congestion.    In the 1970s, wake vortices--air turbulence produced by large jets when taking off and landing--necessitated increased separations between aircraft and thus led to a new constraint on airport capacity. The Volpe Center provided research support to the FAA in understanding wake vortices so that the real separation requirements could be determined and factored into airport operations.     More than a decade ago, the Center developed the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) to assist air traffic management specialists in minimizing air traffic delays and congestion as well as ensuring smooth and efficient air traffic flow. The system integrates real-time flight and weather data from multiple sources and presents information graphically in a highly adaptable and easy-to-understand format, alerting controllers to circumstances likely to produce congestion. The Center continues to enhance this system, while also playing an important role in the Collaborative Decision Making Program, which is aimed at improving information exchange among air traffic controllers, flight crews, and airline operations centers.    Today, the Volpe Center continues to support the FAA as it works to improve the ability of the National Airspace System (NAS) to meet increased demand for air travel. The NAS is an ongoing modernization effort intended to provide increased benefits to all users through new technologies, operational changes, and collaboration among users and providers. One major element of the NAS modernization is the implementation of Free Flight: a system concept that will, whenever practical and safe, remove the restrictions imposed by the existing air traffic system and allow pilots to choose their own preferred route and speed. FAA and the aviation industry are cooperating in the Safe Flight 21 Program, which will demonstrate and evaluate how communications, navigation, and surveillance technologies can support the introduction of Free Flight. The Volpe Center provides advanced surface surveillance data fusion and sensor processing systems in support of Safe Flight 21 demonstration activities at the Memphis International Airport in Tennessee and the Louisville International Airport in Kentucky.    New Opportunities with ITS    Across the country, from advanced traffic control to freeway management systems and ""smart cards,"" state and local agencies are applying Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies and methods to meet tough transportation challenges. In 1992, the Center assisted the DOT in the formation of the ITS Joint Program Office, which oversees funding and implementation of local programs. The core principle of ITS is integrating technologies, transportation modes, and programs to create a better functioning overall system. Overcoming institutional barriers has presented one of the greatest challenges. Like computer technology in the 1980s, ITS requires individuals and organizations to think and function differently, if its benefits are to be realized. The Center has examined institutional systems and relationships, and identified ways to support the changes necessary to continue ITS expansion. The Center also has been involved in the major effort to develop National ITS Architecture and Standards, which will be central to federal policy on integrating systems and programs.     By encouraging the interoperability of systems throughout the country, these standards will facilitate and support widespread implementation of ITS technologies and applications.    The Volpe Center has assisted the DOT ITS Joint Program Office in many activities related to design, management, and performance of that program. It has also been actively involved in many specific implementation projects. As an example, the State of Maryland was experiencing paralyzing roadway congestion resulting from a booming economy and a growing population. Use of the state highway system had increased by 60 percent over the past 20 years. State transportation planners projected that the future growth in traffic would outpace any realistic hope of expanding capacity solely through the construction or expansion of roadways. With help from the Volpe Center, Maryland has developed a comprehensive ITS strategy to increase the efficiency of the existing road network. In looking for innovative solutions, the state has allowed communications firms to locate facilities, such as fiber-optic cables, within a highway right-of-way in exchange for communication infrastructure or services to the state ITS network.     The Volpe Center is also assisting a number of states and local communities in developing and implementing smart card systems. Smart cards, or electronic payment systems, allow transit users to store their fares on a single card instead of searching for exact change or dealing with tokens. Because eliminating cash transactions can significantly reduce the administrative and accounting costs of fare collection, transit providers throughout the country are looking at making smart cards the basis of cashless fare systems. For example, students attending Cleveland State University can use the same card to buy lunch and use the transit system. By evaluating technology costs and transportation impacts the Volpe Center is supporting the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority and Cleveland State University in these kinds of experiments with multi-use cards. Smart cards can also be used to pay for tolls, parking, and other transportation services.    The Center is helping other transportation organizations, such as the Virginia Department of Transportation, to evaluate the benefits of multimodal electronic payment systems that combine transit fares, highway tolls, and parking fees. The Center's work on paratransit systems continues by providing technical support to the City of Los Angeles in implementing an electronic payment system for paratransit clients.     The Volpe Center is involved in educating and communicating the benefits of new technologies. For the FTA's Advanced Public Transportation Systems, the Volpe Center has developed a Mobile Showcase, a ""traveling classroom,"" that tours the country and demonstrates transit-related ITS initiatives to encourage their adoption at the local level. The showcase has provided a forum for the exchange of information and for developing productive relationships with other organizations through such vehicles as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements.    Transportation Alternatives    Various initiatives across the country are examining high-speed rail systems as a method to provide quick, affordable transportation alternatives to crowded highways and airways. The Center supports the Federal Railroad Association's (FRA) Next Generation High-Speed Rail Technology Demonstration Program, which was established in 1994 to encourage state transportation authorities to adapt existing technologies and upgrade rail lines in order to handle high-speed trains. Currently, several states are planning high-speed rail systems and making necessary improvements. The Volpe Center supports these efforts by performing economic analyses and investigating methods for improving the system as well as helping to set minimum safety standards for mixing high-speed passenger and freight operations. In a related area, the Center has been working with the FRA to study and develop technologies such as positive train control and high-speed grade crossing protection.     The Center's support for alternative technologies started in the 1970s, when the Center was involved in testing a magnetic levitation (maglev) system at the Pueblo High Speed Ground Test Center, in Colorado. Maglev technology uses electromagnetic forces to lift, propel, and guide a vehicle over specially designed guideways, allowing for high-speed, energy-efficient transportation. The Volpe Center is currently supporting the FRA in a deployment program where the FRA plans to develop and construct an operational maglev public transportation system. The Center's support consists of preparing Environmental Impact Statements for the technology, and serving on the technical advisory panel that will choose where the first maglev system will be deployed.    The future of high-speed rail transportation depends on its economic viability and convenience. In 1990, the Center identified and characterized costs and benefits of improvements that could be achieved in commuter and intercity rail service on the Northeast Corridor, stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C. Jointly sponsored by FTA and the FRA, the Volpe study clarified cost and trip-time benefits that could be obtained through major investments in the Boston-New York rail infrastructure. This information provided a basis for developing a consensus among owners, operators, and all levels of government. This work also was a key element in shaping the plans now being implemented by federal and state agencies and Amtrak to achieve frequent and reliable 3-hour Boston-New York service.    Future Mobility Needs     In 1997, the transportation network supported 4.6 trillion passenger-miles of personal transportation and approximately 4 trillion ton-miles of freight movement. Industry and government predictions confirm that local and long-distance travel will continue to grow as a result of greater vehicle availability, reduced travel costs, population increases, an expanding economy, and higher consumer incomes. The Volpe Center will continue to assess the needs of transportation systems and bring together the necessary technologies for improving mobility and accessibility.       Economic Growth History    Throughout history, the introduction of new modes of transport and other innovations in transportation technology have encouraged commercial activity and economic growth.     The DOT has the broad goal of ensuring a comprehensive and integrated transportation system that meets the needs of citizens and businesses, and that keeps our economy competitive on a world scale. The Volpe Center has provided substantial support to this mission over the last 30 years, solving problems and maximizing opportunities in all modes of transportation. The Center's activities and expertise have helped to maintain a reliable, efficient, and modern transportation system--a critical lifeline that keeps the U.S. economy strong and vibrant.    Crisis and Opportunity in the 1970s    The energy crisis of the mid-1970s presented the Center with an opportunity to address difficult challenges and to define a key role in supporting the nation's economic interests. Because the United States is strongly dependent on foreign oil, the decision by oil exporting countries to raise prices and limit supplies sent shock waves throughout the American economy. It appeared that the nation could be held hostage by oil producing foreign countries. The government quickly mobilized to explore approaches to address long-term economic problems presented by these realities. The Motor Vehicle Goals (MVG) Program involved the DOT and the U.S. Department of Energy in a national review of the oil and auto industries. The program examined a variety of issues ranging from oil dependency and pricing to automobile manufacturing techniques and industry competitiveness. The Volpe Center provided significant support to the program by conducting detailed economic research and analysis on the automobile industry.    In light of the new market dynamics for oil, decreasing the country's fuel consumption figured prominently in federal economic policy. In 1975, Congress established fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. The goal was to increase average fuel efficiency of new American-built cars to 27.5 miles per gallon over a 10-year time frame. To ensure this final standard would be met, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) developed a set of incremental standards to measure the industry's progress.     Improving vehicle fuel efficiency would require major changes in design and manufacturing. Building upon the studies it conducted for the MVG Program, the Volpe Center supported NHTSA in developing realistic incremental standards that would be technically and economically feasible for the automotive industry. Excessively aggressive requirements could have serious consequences for the industry, and could result in decreased raw steel sales, regional pockets of high unemployment, and other potential impacts. Because the standard macroeconomic analysis model would not identify all these effects, the Volpe team conducted a more comprehensive and systematic analysis. This approach included a wide variety of activities ranging from technical feasibility studies of vehicle manufacturing, to assessments of shifting U.S. consumer demand, to the identification of broad national policy and economic concerns.    By examining all the various integrated factors, the Volpe Center developed a detailed picture of the wide-ranging impacts of fuel efficiency initiatives. It became an acknowledged expert in automotive economic research, and served as a communication bridge between government and the industry to facilitate the development of acceptable incremental fuel efficiency standards. The Center's analysis was also considered by the federal government in its decision to provide an unprecedented loan guarantee to the Chrysler Corporation, one of the nation's ""Big Three"" automakers that, by the late 1970s, sank into bankruptcy due to industry and market changes.      In addition to this keynote analysis of the automotive and fuel issues, during its first 10 years, the Volpe Center conducted socioeconomic and engineering studies for all modes of transportation. Emerging computer technology proved to be a valuable tool for these efforts, and Center staff developed computerized information systems to serve the needs of Volpe analysts and engineers. The systems greatly facilitated modeling and simulation activities conducted for various studies, providing enhanced capabilities and performance.     While the Volpe Center began work in the 1970s by providing internal support to the DOT's ongoing initiatives, its contributions to the national response to the energy crisis demonstrated the sensitivity of the Center's activities to external factors. This trend would continue as a technological revolution took place in the next decade.    Technology Changes the World of Work     In the 1980s, computer technology hit the workplace. Both government and private industry quickly moved to take advantage of the power and productivity and enhancement potential of inexpensive desktop computers, driven by continued improvements in computing speed and storage capacity.    Over the last two decades, the immense economic value of the revolution in Information Technology (IT) has been demonstrated in all segments of our society. Computers hold great value for information-rich organizations such as government agencies, allowing them to manage their work with greater efficiency and accuracy. To reap these benefits, many agencies sought to incorporate IT and Management Information Systems (MIS) in their operations.     Responding to this broad demand, the Volpe Center expanded its IT work to develop systems for external clients ranging from desktop office automation to major mainframe applications. During this time, the Volpe Center developed a reputation for its ability to identify and address the diverse operational needs of clients and relate them to the offerings of the IT marketplace. The Center's activities covered a broad spectrum from custom software development, system deployment, and staff training to Local Area Network installation and telecommunications management.     The Center became known for its ability to analyze new technologies and to help clients understand how they could best be utilized, how they would impact users and field operations, and how systems could be integrated across agencies.     The Volpe Center worked on numerous IT initiatives in the 1980s, and provided significant support to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in this area. Beginning in 1983 and in support of the National Airspace System (NAS), the Center provided analysis, development, deployment, and training to the FAA on information management tools such as the Telecommunications Information Management System.  This system automates the management of acquisition, inventory, and billing processes associated with the FAA's telecommunications assets.    More recently, the Center has supported the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) under the National Transit Database (NTD) Project in developing software to apportion over $3 billion annually to urban areas for public transit service.  The apportionment involves a formula with factors based on public transit service and productivity.  The Center provides a range of support to FTA projects to assist in developing the usefulness of the NTD to planners, policy makers, and industry researchers.  The NTD is used to improve the management and operations of the over 500 U.S. public transit systems.      The move to incorporate wide-scale computer use into government operations was broad and swift. IT had become critical to organizations' economic performance, and work in this area has since expanded to cover a wide spectrum of applications. For example, the Center recently developed an Environmental MIS to assist the U.S. Postal Service in managing its environmental conservation efforts. This system supports cost-effective approaches to protecting the environment.    While computers provided tangible benefits, the technology was complex and presented serious new challenges. Computers not only changed the way people worked, they changed the way organizations functioned. To ensure that technology was successfully integrated into the workplace, the Volpe Center expanded its activities into the new realm of organizational development.Working with the Federal Highway Administration and FTA, the Volpe Center crafted a clear and uniform perspective on the use of technology in transit and transportation planning. In the early 1980s the Center produced a series of reports on microcomputers in transportation, that were distributed to state, regional, and local transportation organizations. Designed to help them be smart consumers of technology, the publications emphasized the need to consider organizational and technological issues. They also provided guidance to the organizations for developing sound technology application strategies.    One of the Center's major efforts during this period was with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Each year the military moves thousands of personnel and tons of material around the world, increasingly utilizing the civil transportation system. But accommodating the unique requirements of military transport sometimes put a strain on commercial carriers. The challenge intensified during the 1980s, when the DoD began shifting to a much greater reliance on civil transportation resources, soon becoming the world's largest user of the civil system.    Working with the Logistics Directorate of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Volpe Center conducted transportation logistics studies to determine more effective ways to coordinate military usage of civil transportation. These studies were critical to the DoD's formation of the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM). Operating as a single defense transportation system manager, with control over multi-modal military and civil resources, TRANSCOM marked a significant commitment by the DoD toward greater cooperation between military and civil interests. The Volpe Center provided ongoing support to TRANSCOM by helping them to integrate military concerns with changes in the civil transportation system. This enhanced coordination provided more reliable, cost- effective, and efficient military use of civil transportation resources, which in turn allowed these systems to appropriately serve ongoing civilian and commercial needs.    The growth of containerized shipping in the United States in the 1980s presented a challenge for the DoD, as it did for all freight carriers. Loading large, closed containers with goods at a point of origin and transporting them via ship, rail, and truck offered marked improvements in efficiency and cost-savings. But containerized shipping presented problems for tracking and monitoring freight throughout the shipping cycle. Computer technology presented one of the solutions. For the military, the Volpe Center developed software that used Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and radio frequency tag systems to track both containers and their content. These technologies are now being used for commercial applications worldwide. The widespread use of freight containers has had a profound impact on the global economy by reducing the time it takes to ship freight and dramatically reducing the cost.     By assisting DOT agencies in deploying IT systems--and by working to fully integrate the technology through addressing various strategic, organizational, and human factors, the Volpe Center, in the 1980s, helped to significantly improve the performance and effectiveness of transportation planning and operations. This work ensured that our transportation system would be prepared to respond to future changes. The Center's reputation for encouraging innovative technologies made it a prime candidate to implement DOT's highly competitive Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program. Established in 1982 in 11 different government agencies, the SBIR program encouraged small businesses to undertake high-tech research, by providing ""seed money"" to foster commercialization of innovative technologies and ideas. DOT's SBIR program has been successful in encouraging the technical creativity of the private sector, and Volpe has established a relationship of trust with the participants.    Global Growth and Expansion     The last decade of the 20th century saw continuing growth and expansion in the U.S. economy. The lowering of trade barriers around the world opened new markets, creating a truly global economy. In addition, the U.S. population continued to increase. These changing market and social dynamics presented challenges to all modes of transportation, as the demand for timely and efficient service began to tax the existing limits of the various modal systems.     Much of the Volpe Center's work during the 1990s centered on bolstering the performance and capacity of the transportation system, to help ensure a high level of mobility across the country and around the world. Continued modernization and enhancement of traffic management operations was a key strategy for achieving this goal. Optimizing and improving the current systems is essential to the continued growth of both the U.S. and the global economy. The Center has been involved in improving traffic management systems for both aviation and shipping.     The steady rise in air traffic over the past 10 years has had a major impact on the global economy, and as the global economy expanded so too did the demands on the air transportation system. Airports across the country are trying to handle an increasing number of flights, but the skies and runways are reaching capacity. The Center has worked closely with the FAA to mitigate these problems. The Center's role in developing and implementing the Enhanced Traffic Management System, which helps air traffic controllers manage the flow of thousands of daily flights, has had a continuing positive effect on the efficiency of the National Air Space, and has been a critical building block for the FAA in modernizing the system.     Maritime shipping lanes also needed to improve their traffic management capabilities. One innovative approach to achieving this involves the application of GPS technology. The highly accurate position information provided by GPS technology makes it ideal for assisting navigation through shipping channels. When large cargo ships must traverse narrow waterways, the careful scheduling and navigation of their passage is critical to maximizing efficiency. The Center had a critical role in developing a GPS-based navigation system first for the St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation and subsequently for the Panama Canal Commission. Both systems have allowed more accurate scheduling, shorter transit times and lower shipping costs with a resulting positive impact on both economic growth and trade.     A fully functioning, global free-market economy requires the efficient movement of people and goods between countries. The number of people entering the United States at air and seaports and land-based border crossings may soon exceed 500 million per year. The Volpe Center's work on facilitating border crossings, without compromising national security, is featured in the article on National Security in this issue of the Volpe Journal.    The future economic growth of the United States is dependent on the ability of policy makers to formulate a vision of the transportation needs of the future and to anticipate the use of advanced technologies in the transportation arena. The ability to expand roadways to address congestion has become limited by geographic realities and environmental considerations. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are designed to enhance mobility through a combination of technology, programs, and policies. ITS includes a range of technology from variable message signs on roadways, to in-vehicle navigation systems using GPS technology. But the focus is not limited to roadways. ITS initiatives also include transit, motor carriers, and rail as elements of achieving the goal of a fully integrated transportation system.    Federal legislation passed in 1991 gave greater autonomy to state and local transportation officials. Since then the Volpe Center has had an opportunity to work with states and municipalities in areas that directly affect economic growth and trade. The State of New Mexico entered into a partnership with the Center to evaluate the economic benefits of a new approach to road building. Several other states and local authorities have turned to the Volpe Center for assistance in implementing new technologies. For example, the Center has collaborated with state and local agencies in the implementation of ""smart cards,"" the technology that stores value and information on wallet-sized cards and allows users to pay for goods and services or enter controlled areas.     Future Economic Growth    The last 30 years have illustrated the degree to which transportation is affected by changes in technology, social trends, government policy, and organizational philosophy. The Volpe Center has continually demonstrated its agility in addressing change, challenges, and opportunities. A key factor in the Center's success is an emphasis on continued learning. Each project allows the Center to continually build upon what it has learned, and to carry that knowledge into future work.     Innovation in transportation requires an educated and motivated workforce, and the Center strongly supports the development of future talent. The Garrett A. Morgan Technology and Transportation Futures Program provides an educational link between America's youth and transportation professionals to foster an interest in transportation careers, and will help ensure that the country's 21st century transportation workforce is technologically literate and internationally competitive. Federal, state, and local government agencies, education professionals, industry leaders and others who share a deep interest in improving the skills and abilities of students have formed a public-private partnership, known as the Career Cluster Transportation, Distribution, and Logisitics Initiative. This initiative builds on the success of the Garrett A. Morgan Program, and encourages and helps students who may be pursuing a career in transportation, distribution, and logistics.    The Volpe Center also contributes to programs in continuing education directed toward the current transportation workforce. The recent introduction of advanced technologies is transforming the demands made on the transportation professionals. These technologies provide transportation professionals with the tools to manage, operate, and maintain transportation systems in real time. It has become more critical than ever for transportation professionals at all levels to be trained in these technologies, and to understand their benefits and impacts on transportation systems and networks. In response, the DOT established the ITS Professional Capacity Building Program (PCB) in 1996 to provide training and education on these new information and communication technologies. Since the inception of the ITS PCB Program, the Volpe Center has worked closely with the ITS PCB Program Coordinator to design and implement a comprehensive, nationwide program to train and educate transportation professionals.    The explosive growth in the use of the Internet, e-commerce, and wireless communication in the last several years has set enormous changes in motion. Work practices and commuting patterns are changing, as are shopping and distribution models. The Volpe Center has already begun working on ways to address these issues.     The dramatic growth in the power and deployment of information technology and e-commerce has transformed the global supply chain. The Volpe Center is working with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and DOT's Office of the Secretary to capture the implications of alternative scenarios such as shifting freight transport from rail and marine carriers to the nation's roadways. This work will help industry as it develops more efficient pricing mechanisms to ensure the continued viability of the U.S. intermodal freight network as e-commerce usage increases.    As satellite networks and our dependence on them expand, and with the International Space Station's deployment supporting the prospect of future space-based manufacturing, the space transportation sector can only grow. The Center is providing technical support to the FAA's Office of the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation. The Office plays a major role in the preparation of required environmental documentation for new commercial launch vehicles, facilities, and operations. The Center also has been working with the new Spaceport Florida Authority to support the state's efforts to maximize the economic potential of its space industry.     The Center's comprehensive, multi-modal expertise positions it to address the challenges and opportunities of the future. The work of the Volpe Center will continue to contribute to ensuring that transportation will support the economic vitality of our nation.

GX098-60-13923925	"MASSACHUSETTS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SECURES $950,000 FOR METROWEST COMMUNITY TRANSPORTATION                     DECEMBER 4, 2001                   WASHINGTON, DC -- Today, U.S. Congressmen Marty Meehan, Jim McGovern, Richard Neal, and Edward Markey joined U.S. Senators Edward Kennedy and John Kerry in announcing that $450,000 in funding for the MetroWest Community Transportation Pilot Project (CTPP) has been successfully secured along with $500,000 to establish a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The funding is included in the fiscal year 2002 Transportation Appropriations Conference Report, which will go on to the White House for the President’s signature.     The purpose of the CTPP is to build a model of effective community-based, grassroots, participatory transportation planning that can address the specific needs of low-income communities.  The services provided by the CTPP will afford low-income individuals access to transportation in the Metrowest region.    ""The delegation worked well together to secure this important community transportation funding for the Metrowest region.  The Metrowest region needs these funds for residents and commuters that want to get to work but currently have limited transportation options. This innovative program will have a far- reaching impact on regional transportation planning,"" Congressman Meehan said.   “I am very pleased that we were able to obtain funding for this project,” said Congressman McGovern.  “This project is a great way to reach out to the less fortunate members of the Metrowest community and connect them with employment centers, job training, childcare, social services, and a host of other resources.  This project is extremely innovative and has far reaching implications for transportation planning.”   “I’m pleased we were able to obtain funds for this needed initiative to help our communities deal with the consequences of sprawl,” Senator Kennedy said. “Rapid growth has put excessive pressure on local traffic patterns, these transit improvements are essential to both the economy and the environment of the region. Increased use of mass transit will also significantly reduce auto emissions and improve air quality across the state.""   Senator Kerry said, ""Securing federal investment for critical transportation needs in the MetroWest area is a victory for our congressional delegation. This funding is a major step towards making  public transportation in the area more accessible and environmentally sound -- a must for this growing community.""   Congressman Neal said, “The CTPP program will be guided locally by community based organizations, who will work closely with the staff of the Metro Southwest regional employment board, and the project management staffs from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Metrowest/495 Transportation Management Association.   The CTPP program will be guided locally by community-based organizations, who will work closely with the staff of the Metro Southwest regional employment board and the project management staffs from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and the Metrowest/495 Transportation Management Association.    Additionally, the state is currently completing a study to examine the feasibility of creating a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The study is anticipated to support the creation of a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority.  The federal funding will facilitate the establishment and implementation of a Metrowest Regional Transit Authority -- specifically supporting the development of efficient bus routes and schedules; procurement and contracting for bus services, drivers, and vehicles; establishment of shuttle service between employment areas and new commuter rail stations; and site search and procurement of bus garage sites, among other activities.   “I am very pleased that we were able to secure funding to establish a MetroWest Regional Transit Authority.” Meehan said.   “The influx of high-tech companies and new employees has revealed a need for improvements in regional transportation. We must work together to provide the infrastructure to support continued growth and economic development while protecting our environment.  The proposed regional transit authority would help relieve the strain on local roads and highways while improving the quality of life in the area.”   Rep. Markey said, “I am pleased with the transportation conference report that provides $500,000 for the MetroWest RTA to develop a regional mass transportation strategy and system.  The tremendous economic and population growth experienced by the MetroWest area over the past decade has pushed our transportation infrastructure to the brink.  The federal government has an important role to play in ensuring that this infrastructure keeps pace with growth. I am enthusiastic about the approach being taken by the member communities of the MetroWest RTA and am pleased that this vision will now be realized.  I look forward to continuing to work with the MetroWest RTA to meet the changing transportation needs of the area, and to ensure its continued prosperity.”          Next                                                            Previous                News Release List"

Beware  many common items used every day in the home or workplace may seem harmless; however, when transported by air, they can be very dangerous.  In flight, variations in temperature and pressure can cause items to leak, generate toxic fumes or start a fire.                   Personal care items containing hazardous materials (e.g., flammable perfume, aerosols) more than 70 ounces may be carried on board. Contents of each container may not exceed 16 fluid ounces.                   Matches and lighters may only be carried on your person.  However, strike-anywhere matches, lighters with flammable liquid reservoirs, and lighter fluid are forbidden.                   Firearms and ammunition may not be carried by a passenger on an aircraft. However, unloaded firearms may be transported in checked baggage if declared to the agent at check in and packed in a suitable container. Handguns must be in a locked container.  Boxed small arms ammunition for personal use may be transported in checked luggage. Amounts may vary depending on the airline.                   Dry ice (4 pounds or less) for packing perishables, may be carried on board an aircraft provided the package is vented.                   Electric wheelchairs must be transported in accordance with airline requirements.  The battery may need to be disconnected, removed, and the terminals insulated to prevent short circuits.

Return to        top                        Baggage and Packing           Many problems associated with checking your baggage can be solved before you leave for the airport.  It is recommended that the following items be packed into a carry-on bag:                  Small valuables (cash, credit cards, jewelry, cameras, personal computers)    Critical items (medicine, keys, passport, business papers)         Irreplaceable items (manuscripts, heirlooms)         Fragile Items (eyeglasses, liquids, glass containers)                          These items should be carried personally or packed in a carry-on bag that will fit under your seat on the plane.  The only way to be absolutely sure that your valuables are not lost or damaged is to keep them with you.  Even if your baggage is not lost, it could be delayed for as much as a few days.  Do not pack perishables or food items because they may spoil if there is a delay.  It is also suggested that you pack items that you will need during the first 24 hours in a carry-on bag, such as toiletries and a change of underwear.                             Watch your bags and personal belongings at all times.                   Do not accept packages from strangers.                   If you see unattended bags or packages anywhere in the airport terminal or parking area, immediately report them to a security officer or other authority.                   Report any suspicious activities or individuals in the airport or parking lot to airport security.                  Dont joke about having a bomb or firearm.  Dont discuss terrorism, weapons, explosives, threats while going through the security checkpoint.  The mere mention of words such as gun, etc., can compel security personnel to detain and question you.  They are trained to consider comments as real threats.                                Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.

Consider taking public transportation to the airport, if possible.  Parking and curbside access will be controlled and limited.                       Curbside check-in is available only at specific locations.  Contact your airline to see if it is available for your flight.                       Do not leave your car unattended in front of the terminal.  Security measures dictate that unattended cars will be towed.                          Return to        top                                                Checking In                   Checked baggage is subject to weight, size and numerical limits.  On most domestic and international flights, there is a limit of two checked bags per passenger.  You may be subject to extra charges if you bring more, or if you exceed the airlines weight and size restrictions for baggage.    Be sure to clearly label each of your bags with your name, address and phone number.  Without proper labeling, it is difficult to locate lost baggage.  When you check in, also be sure to remove all straps, hooks, and other objects on your luggage that may get caught in the baggage handling machinery.                             Adult passengers must bring a government-issued photo ID.  The FAA requires that air carriers request government-issued identification, such as a drivers license or draft card, if the passenger appears old enough to have an ID.  If a government-issued photo ID is not available, bring two pieces of ID, one of which must be from a governmental authority.                       E-ticket travelers should check with their airline to make sure they have proper documentation.                       Automated kiosks are available for airlines that have appropriate security measures in place.  Travelers interested in this option should check with their airlines.                       Be prepared to answer questions about your bags.  When asked who packed your bags and if you might have left them unattended at anytime, think carefully and answer the questions honestly.  Criminals may use unsuspecting passengers to carry bombs or other dangerous items onto aircraft.                       Be cooperative as screeners ask to hand-search your bags.  Security personnel will search the x-ray scan cannot determine its contents.                                Be sure to check with the airline you are traveling on for their individual policies.

For fare information, consumers can contact a travel agent, another ticket outlet or an airline serving their intended destination.  Consumers should also contact each airline to ask about the fares they charge and whether any special promotional fares are being offered.  It is also helpful to pay attention to newspaper, television and radio ads for airline advertisements and discounts.  Consumers with access to the Internet should also visit airline web sites and check for special discount rates.  When purchasing tickets over the Internet, encryption and security precautions should be used.                                                       Tips for Choosing Among Air Fares                   Be flexible with your travel plans in order to get the lowest fare available. Significant savings are sometimes available by flying on certain days, at different times, or even by taking a different flight on the same day.  Consumers should be careful in purchasing discount rated fares because many are non-refundable. If plans change, you may not get your money back.   Make your travel plans as far ahead of schedule as possible.  Many discount rates are limited to a certain number of seats per plane.  Once a ticket is purchased, consumers should call the airline a few times before departure and compare their fare to any other special offers.  New offers are available every day and many airlines, upon inquiry, will refund the difference between a reserved price and a new special offer.    Simply holding a reservation number without a ticket does not guarantee a fare.  While many airlines will not increase the fare after a ticket is issued and paid for, others may reserve the right to collect more money for the same ticket at a later time.  Consumers should inquire about an airlines pricing policy before purchasing a ticket.          Airlines offering interstate and/or foreign flights are required to include a conspicuous written notice, either on the ticket or on another separate written document, that the full text of any contract terms incorporated by reference on the ticket may be inspected at the carriers airport or local ticket office. [1]        These terms may include:                                      Limitations upon carrier liability;                       Claim restrictions, including the applicable periods within which passengers must pursue claims;                       Rights of the carrier to change the terms of the contract, change schedules, and substitute carriers; and                       Rules concerning reservations, check-in times, and refusals to carry.                                An airline must, upon request, provide the full text of its contract to consumers free of charge.  Where an airline is shown to have failed to do so, it may not deny a claim made by a passenger concerning a term purportedly incorporated by reference.  Questions and complaints regarding this rule should be directed to the U.S. Department of Transportation.  See  Appendix .                           Return to        top                                                Reservations and Tickets                   When making a reservation, consumers should be sure the agent records their information accurately.  Review all of the essential information - your name, the flight numbers and travel dates - with the agent before hanging up.  When purchasing tickets more than one week in advance of traveling, you should give the airline your home and work telephone numbers so they can let you know of any changes in the flight schedule.   If you plan to fly during a busy travel period, call for reservations well ahead of time.   Holiday  flights often sell out months before the actual date of travel.  Travelers should avoid using stand-by or open return tickets during these periods as well.  When travel is extremely time sensitive, the larger airlines can provide you with an on-time performance code for flights you are considering.  This enables a traveler to choose among the most punctual flights being offered.   When a reservations agent asks you to buy your tickets by a specific time or date, this is a deadline that must be adhered to.  If you fail to meet this deadline, the airline is entitled to cancel the reservation without notice.  When purchasing tickets, it is best to do this in person instead of relying upon the mail or picking them up on the day of travel.  By doing so, you will avoid both the possibility of losing tickets in the mail and having to wait in line before boarding.   It is suggested that travelers reconfirm their reservations before they start their trip because flight schedules are subject to change.  For international flights, most airlines require that passengers reconfirm their reservations at least 72 hours in advance.  Failure to do so entitles the airline to cancel the reservation.   Whenever possible, consumers should purchase their airline tickets through the use of a credit card.  Payment by credit card provides certain protections under federal credit laws. [2]   When a refund is due, the airline must forward a credit to your card company within seven business days after receiving a complete refund application.  If you paid by credit card for a refundable fare and you have trouble getting a refund that you are due, report this in writing to your credit card company.  If this is done within 60 days from the time that the credit card company mailed your first monthly statement reflecting the charge in question, the card company should credit your account even if the airline does not.  This option is particularly useful where the airline you purchased a ticket from happens to go out of business before the date of your flight.   Airline tickets are comparable to  negotiable documents , which means that they are quite difficult to replace once lost or stolen.  Every safeguard should be undertaken so that this does not occur.  You should write down the ticket numbers as soon as you receive them, in case they are misplaced or stolen.  This may enable the airline to quickly replace a lost ticket.    If the airline is unable to replace the ticket right away, the passenger will have to purchase a replacement ticket and process a refund application for the lost ticket.  This can take up to six months.                            Return to        top                                                E-Tickets                   Electronic airline tickets, commonly known as E-Tickets, are a relatively new means of purchasing airline tickets.  Many airlines now offer E-Tickets as an alternative to standard paper tickets.  The consumer is given a record locator number and written receipt, and must show his or her credit card and appropriate photo ID at the airport gate.  By reducing ticketing costs, speeding up the accounting and billing process, and reducing the handling costs involved with paper tickets, E-Tickets promise tremendous savings for consumers and the airline industry.   Electronic ticketing is not, however, completely paperless.  Most passengers still want or need a hard copy Passenger Receipt, and most airlines still have a need to issue a paper  Boarding Pass  Also, various government regulations and the Warsaw Convention on liability still require that various paper notices be provided to passengers.   When purchasing an E-Ticket over the telephone, note the name of the ticketing agent, as well as the date and time you purchased the electronic ticket. Then ask the agent to fax or mail you an itinerary indicating that you have purchased an electronic ticket, and a copy of all associated terms and conditions of use.                            Return to        top                                                Delayed and Canceled Flights                   When making travel plans, passengers should always consider the possibility of a flight delay or cancellation.  Making reservations on a second or back-up flight should not be done without first finding out whether you have to pay a cancellation fee or a higher fare for altering your reservations.  If a flight is available on another airline, you can ask the delayed airline to endorse your ticket to the second airline, thereby avoiding a fare increase.  Although there is no rule requiring airlines to do this, they often do so in the interest of good public relations.   If a scheduled flight is canceled, the airline will rebook passengers on the next available flight to the intended destination at no additional charge.  If the rebooking process for another flight involves a significant delay, a passenger may opt to have his or her ticket endorsed and find space on another airline.   Each airline has its own policy on compensating passengers who are stranded as a result of a delayed flight.  If you are delayed, ask the airline staff if they will pay for meals or a phone call.  In situations where the delay is short or where the airline is charging a very low fare for the flight, it is not likely that the airline will offer any help.  Amenities are also likely to be refused where the delay is caused by bad weather or other factors beyond the airlines control.  However, in situations where the airline has caused a significant delay, passengers may often request and have supplied to them a phone call, cab fare, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.  Travelers should keep track of out of pocket expenses and receipts where amenities are denied.  An airlines consumer affairs office may be willing to provide a reimbursement at a later time.   Airlines generally refuse to pay passengers for financial losses resulting from a delayed flight.  If there is significant importance relating to the timeliness of your flight, plan ahead.                            Return to        top                                                Overbooking                        Overbooking is a common practice used by airlines to make up for a certain number of ""no-shows"" on each flight.  When this results in a seating shortage, passengers are sometimes left behind, or bumped.  Airlines must follow federal regulations where this occurs on flights having a capacity of 60 or more passengers. [3]         Passengers may voluntarily be bumped and in cases where an insufficient number of passengers volunteer, involuntary bumping may also be implemented.                           Return to        top                                                Voluntary Bumping                        When a flight is overbooked, the airline is required to seek out passengers who are not in a hurry and are willing to volunteer their seats in return for compensation.  Passengers volunteering to be bumped can keep their original ticket as well.  There are no regulations governing how much a passenger should be compensated for being voluntarily bumped and policies vary among airlines.  Therefore, passengers who volunteer should negotiate with the airline to receive as much compensation as possible.  Before volunteering, you should also ask a few important questions, including:                                  When is the next flight on which the airline can confirm a seat?                       Will the airline provide amenities while waiting for the next flight?                       If a free ticket is offered as compensation, are there restrictions?                                The selection of volunteers is left to the airline and in many cases, they will select those volunteers who are willing to sell back their reservations for the lowest price.                           Return to        top                                                Involuntary Bumping                            Federal regulations require airlines offering flights with a passenger capacity of 60 or more persons to establish boarding priorities for situations where an insufficient number of volunteers offer to take another flight.  In addition, airlines are required to give all involuntarily bumped passengers a written statement describing their rights, including the terms, conditions and limitations on compensation.  Included in this statement must be the airlines boarding priority rules and criteria.    With certain exceptions, travelers who are turned away from a flight are entitled to denied boarding compensation, which amounts to being paid for the inconvenience of having to take another flight.  The amount of denied boarding compensation paid to an involuntarily bumped passenger depends on the price paid for their ticket and the length of the delay.  The following rules govern denied boarding compensation:                             If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination within one hour after your original arrival time, there is no entitlement to compensation.                       If the airline arranges substitute transportation that is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination between one and two hours after your original arrival time, the airline must pay you an amount equal to the price of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $200.  On international flights, the delay in arrival time can be between one and four hours.                       If the airline fails to provide substitute transportation or if the substitute transportation provided is scheduled to deliver you to your final destination more than two hours later (four hours later internationally) than your original arrival time, the denied boarding compensation doubles.  Hence, the airline will be compelled to pay you twice the amount of a one way fare to your final destination, up to $400.                           If you have been involuntarily bumped, you can still keep your original ticket and use it on another flight.  If you choose to make your own arrangements, a request can be made for an involuntary refund to recoup the price of the ticket for the flight you were bumped from.  It is important to note that denied boarding compensation should be given in the form of a check to the passenger on the day and place the bumping occurred.  If the alternative transportation provided by the airline departs before this can be done, the payment must be sent to the passenger within 24 hours.   In cases where an airline has to substitute a smaller plane for the originally scheduled plane, the airline is not required to compensate passengers who are bumped as a result.  Denied boarding compensation may also be withheld in certain cases where it is shown that a passenger has not complied with conditions imposed by the airline.  These may include:                             To be eligible for compensation, passengers must have a confirmed reservation.  Where an airline cannot find your reservation, the presence of an OK status on a ticket will suffice, provided however, that the ticket holder has not missed a required reconfirmation deadline.                       All deadlines for purchasing tickets must be met  Most tickets need to be picked up and paid for no later than 30 minutes before a flight departs.  Discount priced tickets must be purchased within a certain number of days after a reservation is made.                       All deadlines set by the airline for checking in must be met.  Most airlines set an amount of time within which passengers must present themselves to the airline before a scheduled departure.  For most domestic flights, passengers are required to check in at least ten minutes before the time of departure.  Do not count on this being the case every time, in that check in deadlines can be up to an hour or longer.  Check-in deadlines for international flights can be as much as three hours before a flights scheduled departure time.  If you miss the ticketing or check-in deadline for your flight, it is possible to lose both your reservation and the right to compensation if the flight is oversold.                           These rules do not apply in the following situations:   Flights on planes with a capacity of 60 or fewer passengers.    Specially chartered flights, international flights inbound to the United States.    Flights between foreign cities.                           These types of flights may have similar rules that can be obtained from the carrier.  The complete rules for the payment of compensation and boarding priorities for each airline are available at all ticket counters and boarding locations.  Also, a notice concerning the overbooking of flights must be clearly posted at each ticket station.

Return to        top                                               Damage and Loss                   Airlines can limit their liability for delay, loss and damage to baggage. [4]   They must conspicuously display a sign stating the extent to which liability is limited.  Typically, airlines limit their liability to $1,250 per passenger on domestic flights and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage on international flights.   If your bag arrives open, unlocked, or visibly damaged, immediately check to see if any of the contents are missing or damaged.  If so, report the damage to the airline right away and insist on filling out a claim form.  If your luggage arrives smashed or torn, the airline will pay for the repairs in most cases.  If the luggage cannot be fixed, the airline will attempt to negotiate a settlement with you.    Airlines often decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken item or because of inadequate packing precautions.  However, airlines generally do not disclaim liability for fragile merchandise packed in its original factory sealed carton, a cardboard mailing tube, or other container designated for shipping and packed with protective padding material.  If your luggage or an item you are checking is worth more than the monetary cap imposed by the airline, it is suggested that you inquire about purchasing excess valuation insurance from the airline.  This will guarantee replacement if damage does occur.   If your baggage is lost altogether, you will have to fill out another form to secure repayment for your loss.  There are often deadlines associated with filing a lost baggage claim, so it is important to adhere to all of the instructions on the form.  Airlines do not automatically reimburse passengers for the claims they file.  They will use the information you provide to estimate your actual losses, account for depreciation and make an offer of settlement.  Often, an airline will require you to provide receipts for the items you claimed lost.  Generally, it takes between six weeks and three months for an airline to pay a claim for lost luggage.  When they tender a settlement, they may offer either cash or a higher amount in free flight credits.

ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department has also provided information online pertaining to travel scams and card mill scams.  One of the main functions of ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department is the informal mediation of travel-related complaints on behalf of consumers.   Before the Department will become involved in a dispute, it first determines that the complaint meets the following criteria:                             The complaint must be a travel-related dispute against a member of ASTA. You may check a company's membership status in the ASTA Membership Directory found in the ASTAnet directory, or call ASTA's Consumer Affairs Department at 1-703-739-8739.

If your flight has been arranged by a club or other organization for its members it may be what is called an ""affinity"" charter flight. These charters generally do not carry the consumer protection provisions of Public Charters. It is important to be certain of what kind of charter flight you are purchasing.   A Public Charter may include only the flights, or it may be sold as a complete package, including hotels, guided tours, and ground transportation. Either way, your rights are spelled out in a contract you have with the tour operator. The operator or your travel agent should give you a contract to sign at the time you purchase your trip.  This contract should be carefully reviewed before you pay any money.

On some charters, if a substitute can go in your place you only lose a $25 fee.   You can buy trip cancellation insurance. These policies usually provide a refund in case you must cancel due to illness or death in the family. Your travel agent or tour operator can tell you how to buy the insurance and what health conditions it does or doesn't cover.   Cancellation insurance often won't pay you if you must cancel because of a preexisting condition.   The tour operator or airline can cancel a Public Charter for any reason up until 10 days before departure. Your flight might be canceled if it doesn't sell well or for some other reason. This is a risk you take in return for a low fare. (During the last 10 days before departure, a Public Charter can be canceled only if it is physically impossible to operate it.)

Signing a contract does not guarantee that prices won't go up or that itineraries won't change. But, if there is a ""major change"" in your flight or tour, you have the right to cancel and get a penalty-free refund. Major changes include:                                  A change in departure or return city (not including a simple change in the order in which cities are visited).                       A change in departure or return date, unless the date change results from a flight delay. (However, a flight delay of more than 48 hours is a major change.)                       A substitution of a hotel that was not named as an alternate hotel in your contract.

If you choose not to cancel, the operator is not required to make partial refunds. However, if you don't find out about a change until after your trip has begun, you can reject the changed flight or hotel, make and pay for your own alternative plans, and insist on a refund for the changed component when you get home.   No ""open returns"" are allowed on round-trip public charters. Be sure you have a specific return date, city, and flight, in order to avoid being stranded.

The tour operator must have a surety agreement, such as a bond, and must usually have an escrow account at a bank that holds your money until your flight operates. If your money is going into a charter escrow account, the bank will be named in your contract, and the check that is sent to the charter operator should be made payable to that bank. (If you are using a travel agent, it's OK for you to make your check out to that agent; he will make his check payable to the escrow account.) Identify the departure date and destination on the face of the check.

The charter airlines process claims for bags that were lost or damaged while in their possession. If it is not clear where the problem occurred (e.g. between the airport and a hotel), the operator and the airline may both decline liability. To cover yourself, find out if your renter's or homeowner's insurance policy covers losses that happen when you're away from home. You might also ask your travel agent if there's a one-shot baggage insurance policy available to cover baggage problems while you are on your charter trip.

Last-minute schedule changes and departure delays of several hours are not uncommon on charters. A flight can be delayed up to 48 hours before the charter operator must offer you the option to cancel with a full refund.   Charters and scheduled flights operate independently of each other. If there's a delay on the scheduled flight connecting you to the city where your charter departs, causing you to miss your charter, you lose your flight and money. Charter reservations are only good for one flight. If you miss it for any reason, you're probably out of luck. Check with the tour operator to see if he or she has another charter flying to your destination.  If your charter is late returning and causes you to miss a scheduled connecting flight back to your home, you have to pay your own expenses while you wait for the next connection. If you have a discount fare on a scheduled connecting flight you could lose it if the returning charter is delayed. Then you, not the airlines or tour operator, have to pay more for a regular non-discount fare.

You have to claim your baggage and re-check it yourself. When planning a charter, allow plenty of time to check in at the airport from which your charter leaves, or from which you have a connecting flight. On international trips, remember that you may encounter delays in Customs.   You might find seating space for your charter plane to be more crowded than you're used to. The low charter rate depends in part on spreading costs over a large number of people with virtually all of the seats being filled.   If a charter flight hasn't sold out shortly before departure, the operator can sell seats at bargain basement prices to latecomers. Some who have paid the regular price well in advance may object, but should realize that the operator's alternative may be to cancel the flight altogether for economic reasons.

This short work chronicled each of the human space flights conducted by the United States up to that time. At the time of the fortieth anniversary of NASA, born in the aftermath of the Sputnik crisis of 1957-1958, its it fitting to reflect on the record of achievement in human space flight from those first experimental flights of Mercury through the hubris of the Apollo Moon landings to the current flights of the Space Shuttle. Accordingly, as one of its fortieth anniversary projects the NASA History Division sponsored a revision and updating of that earlier chronology.   This is the ninth in a series of special studies prepared by the NASA History Division. The Monographs in Aerospace History series is designed to provide a wide variety of investigations relative to the history of aeronautics and space. These publications are intended to be tightly focused in terms of subject, relatively short in length, and reproduced in an inexpensive format to allow timely and broad dissemination to researchers in aerospace history. Suggestions for additional publications in the Monographs in Aerospace History series are welcome.      ROGER D. LAUNIUS   Chief Historian   National Aeronautics and Space Administration   May 29, 1998     TABLE OF CONTENTS    Introduction   Mercury Missions   Gemini Missions   Apollo Missions   Skylab Missions   Space Shuttle Missions          INTRODUCTION    Almost forty years after the Mercury astronauts made their first brief forays into the new ocean of space, Earth orbit has become a busy arena of human activity. In that time, nearly 300 people have traveled into orbit on U.S. spacecraft. The first astronauts went along, stuffed into capsules barely large enough for their bodies, eating squeeze-tube food and peering out at the Earth through tiny portholes. Their flights lasted only a matter of hours. Today we routinely launch eight people at a time to spend a week living, working and exploring on board the Space Shuttle.   The history of space flight has seen not only an increase in the numbers of people traveling into orbit, but a marked improvements in their vehicles. Each successive spacecraft, from Mercury through Apollo and the Space Shuttle, has been larger, more comfortable, and more capable. Scientists working inside the Shuttle's Spacelab have many of the comforts of a laboratory on Earth, none of which were available when human space flight first began.   Some projects, like Apollo, produced stunning firsts or explored new ""territory."" Others-notably Skylab and the Space Shuttle-advanced our capabilities by extending the range and sophistication of human operations in space. Both kinds of activity are vital to establishing a permanent human presence off the Earth.   Almost forty years after the dawn of the age of space flight, we are learning not just to travel into space, but to live and stay there. That challenge ensures that the decades to come will be just as exciting as the past decades have been.     MERCURY    Project Mercury came into being on October 7, 1958, only a year and three days after the Soviet Union's Sputnik I satellite opened the Space Age. The goal of sending people into orbit and back had been discussed for many years before that, but with the initiation of the Mercury project, theory became engineering reality.   Mercury engineers had to devise a vehicle that would protect a human being from the temperature extremes, vacuum and newly discovered radiation of space. Added to these demands was the need to keep an astronaut cool during the burning, high-speed reentry through the atmosphere. The vehicle that best fit these requirements was a wingless ""capsule"" designed for a ballistic reentry, with an ablative heat shield that burned off as Mercury returned to Earth.   Mercury capsules rode into space on two different kinds of booster. The first suborbital flights were launched on Redstone rockets designed by Wernher von Braun's team in Huntsville, Alabama. For orbital flights, Mercury was placed on top of an Atlas-D, a modified ballistic missile whose steel skin was so thin (to save weight) it would have collapsed like a bag if not pressurized from within.   The first Americans to venture into space were drawn from a group of 110 military pilots chosen for their flight test experience and because they met certain physical requirements. Seven of those 110 became astronauts in April 1959. Six of the seven flew Mercury missions (Deke Slayton was removed from flight status due to a heart condition). Beginning with Alan Shepard's Freedom 7 flight, the astronauts named their own spacecraft, and all added 7 to the name to acknowledge the teamwork of their fellow astronauts.   With only 12.133 cubic meters of volume, the Mercury capsule was barely big enough to include its pilot. Inside were 120 controls, 55 electrical switches, 30 fuses and 35 mechanical levers. Before Shepard's flight, surrogate ""passengers"" tested the integrity of the spacecraft design: two rhesus monkeys, Ham the chimpanzee, and an electronic ""crewman simulator"" mannequin that could breathe in and out to test the cabin environment. Finally, in May 1961, Shepard became the first American in space. Nine months later, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.   The six Mercury flights (which totaled two days and six hours in space) taught the pioneers of space flight several important lessons. They learned not only that humans could function in space, but that they were critical to a mission's success. Ground engineers learned the difficulty of launch preparations, and found that a worldwide communications network was essential for manned space flight.   By the time of the last Mercury flight in May 1963, the focus of the U.S. space program had already shifted. President John F. Kennedy had announced the goal of reaching the Moon only three weeks after Shepard's relatively simple 15-minute suborbital flight, and by 1963, only 500 of the 2,500 people working at NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center were still working on Mercury-the remainder were already busy on Gemini and Apollo.   But Mercury had taken the critical first step, and had given reassuring answers to a number of fundamental questions:       Could humans survive in space?      Could a spacecraft be designed to launch them into orbit?      Could they return safely to Earth?      At the moment John Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule was placed into its orbital trajectory, fulfilling the primary goal of Project Mercury, one member of the launch team on the ground made a notation in his log: ""We are through the gates.""

Shepard, Jr.   Alan Shepard's suborbital flight lasted only 15 minutes, but it proved that an astronaut could survive and work comfortably in space, and demonstrated to the 45 million Americans watching on TV that the United States was now in the space flight business. Freedom 7 was a ballistic ""cannon shot""-Shepard reached no higher than 187.45 kilometers, and traveled only 486.022 kilometers down range from Cape Canaveral. During his short time in space he maneuvered his spacecraft using hand controllers that pitched, yawed and rolled the tiny Mercury capsule with small thrusters. He found the ride smoother than expected and reported no discomfort during five minutes of weightlessness. Although this first Mercury capsule lacked a window, Shepard was able to look down at the Atlantic coastline through a periscope. His view, though, was in black and white-the astronaut had inadvertently left a gray filter in place while waiting on the pad for liftoff.      Mercury Redstone 4 (Liberty Bell 7)   July 24, 1961   Crew Virgil I. ""Gus"" Grissom   Grissom's suborbital mission was essentially a repeat of Shepard's, again using the Redstone launcher instead of the more powerful Atlas. Grissom's Mercury capsule had a few minor improvements, including new, easier-to-use hand controllers, a window, and an explosive side hatch, which the astronauts had requested for easier escape in case of an emergency. Since Shepard's flight had been overly busy, Grissom's duties were deliberately reduced, and he spent more time observing the Earth. The only significant failure came at the end of the 15-minute flight, after Liberty Bell 7 had parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean near the Bahamas. While Grissom waited inside the floating capsule to be picked up by helicopter rescue teams, the side hatch opened, filling the tiny spacecraft with seawater. Liberty Bell sank, but a wet Grissom was safely recovered, and the Mercury program was able to move on to orbital flights.      Mercury Atlas , 6 (Friendship 7)   February 20, 1962   Crew: John H. Glenn, Jr.   John Glenn's orbital flight-an American first-lasted four hours, 55 minutes, during which he circled the Earth three times, observing everything from a dust storm in Africa to Australian cities from an altitude of 260.71 kilometers. Glenn was the first American to see a sunrise and sunset from space, and was the first photographer in orbit, having taken along a 35­millimeter Minolta purchased from a Cocoa Beach, Florida drugstore. The most nervous moments of the flight came before and during reentry, when a signal received on the ground (erroneously, as it turned out) indicated that the capsule's heat shield had come loose. At one point, Glenn thought his shield was burning up and breaking away. He ran out of fuel trying to stop the capsule's bucking motion as it descended through the atmosphere, but splashed down safely, 64.37 kilometers   short of his target (preflight calculations of the spacecraft's weight had not considered the loss of on­board ""consumables""). Glenn returned to Earth a national hero, having achieved Project Mercury's primary goal.   Mercury Atlas 7 (Aurora 7)   May 24, 1962   Crew: M. Scott Carpenter   The focus of Carpenter's five-hour Aurora 7 mission was on science. The full flight plan included the first study of liquids in weightlessness, Earth photography and an unsuccessful attempt to observe a flare fired from the ground. At dawn of the third and final orbit, Carpenter inadvertently bumped his hand against the inside wall of the cabin and solved a mystery from the previous flight. The resulting bright shower of particles outside the capsule-what Glenn had called ""fireflies""-turned out to be ice particles shaken loose from the capsule's exterior. Like Glenn, Carpenter circled the Earth three times. Partly because he had been distracted watching the fireflies and partly because of his busy schedule, he overshot his planned reentry mark, and splashed down 402.34 kilometers off target.      Mercury Atlas 8 (Sigma 7)   October 3, 1962   Crew: Walter M. Schirra, Jr.   Schirra's was the first of two longer-duration Mercury missions. After Carpenter's flawed reentry, the emphasis returned to engineering rather than science (Schirra even named his spacecraft ""Sigma"" for the engineering symbol meaning ""summation."") The six-orbit mission lasted nine hours and l3 minutes, much of which Schirra spent in what he called ""chimp configuration,"" a free drift that tested the Mercury's autopilot system. Schirra also tried ""steering"" by the stars (he found this difficult), took photographs with a Hasselblad camera, exercised with a bungee­cord device, saw lightning in the atmosphere, broadcast the first live message from an American spacecraft to radio and TV listeners below, and made the first splashdown in the Pacific. This was the highest flight of the Mercury program, with an apogee of 283.24 kilometers, but Schirra later claimed to be unimpressed with space scenery as compared to the view from high-flying aircraft. ""Same old deal, nothing new,"" he told debriefers after the flight.      Mercury Atlas 9 (Faith 7)   May 15-16, 1963   Crew: L. Gordon Cooper, Jr.   If Schirra's mission was an endurance test, the final Mercury flight was a marathon. Cooper circled the Earth 22 1/2 times, and released the first satellite from a spacecraft-a l52.4-millimeter sphere with a beacon for testing the astronaut's ability to track objects visually in space. Although a balloon for measuring atmospheric drag failed to deploy properly, Cooper finally completed another Mercury experiment when he was able to spot a powerful, 44,000-watt xenon lamp shining up from the ground. (He also claimed to be able to see individual houses from orbit, even smoke from chimneys in the Tibetan highlands.) During his 34 hours in space, Cooper slept, spoke a prayer into his tape recorder and took the best photographs of the Mercury program, including pictures of the Earth's limb and infrared weather photographs. His mission was deemed a ""great success-so successful, in fact, that it allowed Mercury officials to cancel a planned seventh flight and move on to the two-man Gemini program.          Gemini    Gemini was not pure pioneering like Mercury, nor did it have the excitement of Apollo. But its success was critical to Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon ""by decade's end.""   The program was announced to the public on January 3, l962, after Apollo already was well underway. Gemini's primary purpose was to demonstrate space rendezvous and docking-techniques that would be used during Apollo, when the lunar lander would separate from the command module in orbit around the Moon, then meet up with it again after the astronauts left the lunar surface. Gemini also sought to extend astronauts' stays in space to two weeks, longer than even the Apollo missions would require.   It was during the Gemini program that space flight became routine. Ten piloted missions left the launch pads of Cape Canaveral, Florida, in less than 20 months, and the Manned Spacecraft Center (renamed the Johnson Space Center in 1973) outside Houston, Texas, took over the role of Mission Control. Ground operations became smooth and efficient, due in part to fleetingly short launch windows-the Gemini XI ""window"" opened for only 2 seconds-dictated by the need to rendezvous with targets already in orbit. Meanwhile, sixteen new astronauts chalked up experience in space.   The Gemini spacecraft was an improvement on Mercury (it was originally called Mercury Mark II) in both size and capability. Gemini weighed more than 3,628.72 kilograms-twice the weight of Mercury-but ironically seemed more cramped, having only 50 percent more cabin space for twice as many people. Ejection seats replaced Mercury's escape rocket, and more storage space was added for the longer Gemini flights. The long duration missions also required fuel cells instead of batteries for generating electrical power.   Unlike Mercury, which had only been able to change its orientation in space, Gemini needed real maneuvering capability to rendezvous with another spacecraft. Gemini would have to move forward, backward and sideways in its orbital path, even change orbits. The complexity of rendezvous demanded two people on board, and more piloting than had been possible with Mercury. It also required the first onboard computers to calculate complicated rendezvous maneuvers.   Gemini rode into orbit on a Titan 2 launch vehicle. The target for rendezvous operations was an unmanned Agena upper stage, which was launched ahead of the Gemini. After meeting up in orbit, the nose of the Gemini capsule then fit into a docking collar on the Agena.   To avoid long delays between flights, Gemini spacecraft were made more serviceable, with subsystems that could be removed and replaced easily. An adapter module fitted to the rear of the capsule (and jettisoned before reentry) carried on-board oxygen, fuel and other consumable supplies.   Gemini gave U.S. astronauts their first real experience with living and working in space. They had to learn to sleep and keep house on long flights in crowded quarters, both of which were difficult. Gemini astronauts also made the first forays outside their spacecraft, which required a new spacesuit design. Space walks proved more difficult than expected-following Ed White's successful solo on Gemini IV, it wasn't until the final Gemini flight that another extravehicular activity went as smoothly as planned.   By Gemini's end, an important new capability-orbital rendezvous and docking-had become routine, and space doctors had gained confidence that humans could live, work and stay healthy in space for days or even weeks at a time. Gemini also completed a long list of onboard science experiments, including studies of the space environment and Earth photography. Above all, the program added nearly 1,000 hours of valuable space-flight experience in the years between Mercury and Apollo, which by 1966 was nearing flight readiness. Five days before the launch of the last Gemini, Lunar Orbiter 2 had been sent to the Moon, already scouting out Apollo landing sites.      Project Gemini   Dates : 1965­1966   Vehicles : Titan 2 launcher   Gemini spacecraft   Number of People Flown : 20   Highlights : First orbital rendezvous and docking   First U.S. space-walk   Gemini Bibliography   NASA Sources :   Dethloff, Henry C.

Young   In a playful reference to the Broadway hit The Unsinkable Molly Brown, Grissom nicknamed the Gemini 3 spacecraft ""Molly Brown,"" hoping that it would not duplicate his experience with Liberty Bell 7. (It was the last Gemini to be named by an astronaut. All subsequent flights in the program were designated by a Roman numeral.) The mission's primary goal was to test the new, maneuverable Gemini spacecraft. In space, the crew fired thrusters to change the shape of their orbit, shift their orbital plane slightly, and drop to a lower altitude. The spacecraft was supposed to have enough lift for a precision landing, but reality did not match wind tunnel predictions: Gemini 3 splashed down some 80.47 kilometers short of its intended target. The capsule was designed to land on its side, suspended at two points from a parachute. But during the descent, when the astronauts threw a switch to shift ""Molly Brown"" to its landing position, they were thrown forward with such force that Grissom's faceplate cracked. Still, the first test of the two­seat spacecraft-and of Gemini ground operations-had been a success.   Gemini IV   June 3­7, 1965   Crew: James A McDivitt and Edward H. White II   The plan for this four-day, 62-orbit mission was for Gemini IV to fly in formation with the spent second stage of its Titan 2 booster in orbit. On this first attempt, however, space flight engineers learned something about the complication of orbital rendezvous. Thrusting toward their target, the astronauts only moved farther away. They finally gave up after using nearly half their fuel. (On later rendezvous missions, a spacecraft chasing another in orbit would first drop to a lower, faster orbit before rising again.) The mission's highlight was White's 22-minute space walk, the first ever for an American. Tied to a tether and using a handheld ""zip gun"" to maneuver himself, White swam through space while McDivitt took photographs. Gemini IV set a record for flight duration, and eased fears about the medical consequences of longer missions. It also was the first use of the new Mission Control Center outside Houston, which because of the long duration, had to conduct the first three-shift operations.      Gemini V   August 21 ­29, 1965   Crew: L. Gordon Cooper. Jr. and Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Jr.   Gemini V doubled the space-flight record to eight days, thanks to new fuel cells that generated enough electricity to power longer missions. Cooper and Conrad were to have made a practice rendezvous with a ""pod"" deployed from the spacecraft, but problems with the electricity supply forced a switch to a simpler ""phantom rendezvous,"" whereby the Gemini maneuvered to a predetermined position in space. Mercury Veteran Gordon Cooper was the first person to travel into space twice. He and Conrad took high-resolution photographs for the Defense Department, but problems with the fuel cells and maneuvering system forced the cancellation of several other experiments. The astronauts found themselves marking time in orbit, and Conrad later lamented that he had not brought along a book. On-board medical tests, however, continued to show the feasibility of longer flights.   Gemini VII   December 4-18, 1965   Crew: Frank Barman and James A. Lovell, Jr.   This 14-day mission required NASA to solve problems of long-duration space flight, not the least of which was stowage (the crew had practiced stuffing waste paper behind their seats before the flight). Timing their workday to match that of ground crews, both men worked and slept at the same time. Gemini VII flew the most experiments-20-of any Gemini mission, including studies of nutrition in space. The astronauts also evaluated a new, lightweight spacesuit, which proved uncomfortable if worn for a long time in Gemini's hot, cramped quarters. The high point of the mission was the rendezvous with Gemini VI. But the three days that followed were something of an endurance test, and both astronauts, heeding Pete Conrad's Gemini V advice, brought books along. Gemini VII was the longest space flight in U.S. history, until the Skylab missions of the 1970s.      Gemini VI   December 15­16, 1965   Crew: Walter M. Schirra, Jr. and Thomas P. Stafford   A rendezvous and docking with an unmanned Agena target was this mission's original objective, but when Mission Control lost contact with the Agena during an October launch attempt, an alternate mission was substituted: a meeting in space of two Gemini spacecraft. Eight days after the launch of Borman and Lovell's Gemini VII, Schirra and Stafford tried to join them, but their Titan 2 launcher shut down on the pad (the cool-headed Schirra did not eject, even though the countdown clock had started ticking-he felt no motion, and trusted his senses). Three days later, Gemini VI made it into orbit. Using guidance from the computer as well as his own piloting, Schirra rendezvoused with the companion spacecraft in orbit on the afternoon of December 15. Once in formation, the two Gemini capsules flew around each other, coming within 0.3048 meters of each other but never touching. The two spacecraft stayed in close proximity for five hours. One of Gemini's primary goals-orbital rendezvous-had been achieved.      Gemini VIII   March 16, 1966   Crew: Neil A. Armstrong and David R. Scott   A second major objective of the Gemini program was completed less than six hours after launch, when Neil Armstrong brought Gemini VIII within 0.9144 meters of the pre­launched Agena target, then slowly docked-the first orbital docking ever. What followed, however, were some of the most hair-raising few minutes in space-program history. The Gemini VIII capsule, still docked to the Agena, began rolling continuously. Never having faced this in simulation, the crew undocked from the Agena, but the problem was a stuck thruster on the spacecraft, which now tumbled even faster, at the dizzying rate of one revolution per second. The only way to stop the motion was to use the capsule's reentry control thrusters, which meant that Armstrong and Scott had to cut short their mission and make an emergency return to Earth 10 hours after launch. They were still nauseated after splashdown, as well as disappointed: Scott had missed out on a planned space-walk.      Gemini IX   June 3­6, 1966   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford and Eugene A. Cernan   Stafford and Cernan became the first backup crew to fly in space after the first crew of Elliott See and Charles Bassett died in a plane crash four months before the flight. The highlight of the mission was to have been a docking with a shortened Agena called the Augmented Target Docking Adapter. The docking was canceled, though, after Stafford and Cernan rendezvoused with the target to find its protective shroud still attached, which made it look, in Stafford's words, like an ""angry alligator."" Cernan also was to have tested an Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) ­ a jet-powered backpack stowed outside in Gemini's adapter module, to which the space­walking astronaut was to have strapped himself. But Cernan's space­walk was troubled from the start. His visor fogged, he sweated and struggled with his tasks, and he had problems moving in microgravity. Everything took longer than expected, and Cernan had to go inside before getting a chance to fly the AMU. The device was not finally tested in space until Skylab, seven years later.      Gemini X   July 18-21, 1966   Crew: John W. Young and Michael Collins   Gemini established that radiation at high attitude was not a problem. After docking with their Agena booster in low orbit, Young and Collins used it to climb another is 482.8032 kilometers to meet with the dead, drifting Agena left over from the aborted Gemini VIII flight-thus executing the program's first double rendezvous. With no electricity on board the second Agena the rendezvous was accomplished with eyes only-no radar. After the rendezvous, Collins space-walked over to the dormant Agena at the end of a 15.24-meter tether, making Collins the first person to meet another spacecraft in orbit. He retrieved a cosmic dust­collecting panel from the side of the Agena, but returned no pictures of his close encounter-in the complicated business of keeping his tether clear of the Gemini and Agena, Collins' Hasselblad camera worked itself free and drifted off into orbit.      Gemini XI   September 12-15, 1966   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, Jr. and Richard F. Gordon, Jr.   With Apollo looming on the horizon, Gemini project managers wanted to accomplish a rendezvous immediately after reaching orbit, just as it would have to be done around the Moon. Only 85 minutes after launch, Conrad and Gordon matched orbits with their Agena target stage and docked several times. Conrad had originally hoped for a Gemini flight around the Moon, but had to settle for the highest Earth orbit-1367.94 kilometers-ever reached by an American manned spacecraft. Gordon's first space-walk once again proved more difficult than ground simulations, and had to be cut short when he became overtired. A second, two-hour ""stand-up"" space walk went more smoothly: Gordon even fell asleep while floating halfway out the hatch. An experiment to link the Agena and Gemini vehicles with a 15.24 meter tether (which Gordon had attached during his space-walk) and rotate the joined pair was troublesome-Conrad had problems keeping the tether taut-but was able to generate a modicum of ""artificial gravity."" The mission ended with the first totally automatic, computer-controlled reentry, which brought Gemini XI down only 4.506 kilometers from its recovery ship.      Gemini XII   November 11-15, 1966   Crew: James A. Lovell, Jr. and Edwin E. ""Buzz"" Aldrin, Jr.   By the time of the last Gemini flight, the program still had not demonstrated that an astronaut could work easily and efficiently outside the spacecraft. In preparation for Gemini XII, new, improved restraints were added to the outside of the capsule, and a new technique-underwater training-was introduced, which would become a staple of all future space-walk simulation. Aldrin's two-hour, 20-minute tethered space-walk, during which he photographed star fields, retrieved a micrometeorite collector and did other chores, at last demonstrated the feasibility of extravehicular activity. Two more stand-up EVAs also went smoothly, as did the by­now routine rendezvous and docking with an Agena which was done ""manually"" using the onboard computer and charts when a rendezvous radar failed. The climb to a higher orbit, however, was canceled because of a problem with the Agena booster.             Apollo    The Apollo program had been underway since July 1960, when NASA announced a follow-on to Mercury that would fly astronauts around the Moon. But with President John F. Kennedy's speech of May 25, 1961, declaring the goal of landing an astronaut on the surface of the Moon and returning to Earth by decade's end, Apollo shifted its focus. That goal was achieved with five months to spare, when, on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin touched down in the Sea of Tranquillity.   Apollo was one of the great triumphs of modern technology. Six expeditions landed on the Moon, and one-Apollo 13-was forced to return without landing. Before that, there had been two manned checkouts of Apollo hardware in Earth orbit and two lunar orbit missions.   The Apollo lunar module, or LM, was the first true spacecraft-designed to fly only in a vacuum, with no aerodynamic qualities whatsoever. Launched attached to the Apollo command/service module, it separated in lunar orbit and descended to the Moon with two astronauts inside. At the end of their stay on the surface, the lunar module's ascent stage fired its own rocket to rejoin the command/service module in lunar orbit.   The teardrop-shaped Apollo command module, the living quarters for the three-man crews, had a different shape from the conical-nosed Gemini and Mercury. The attached cylindrical service module contained supplies as well as the Service Propulsion System engine that placed the vehicle in and out of lunar orbit.   Boosting the Apollo vehicles to the Moon was the job of the giant Saturn V-the first launch vehicle large enough that it had to be assembled away from the launch pad and transported there. A fueled Saturn V weighed more than 2.7 million kilograms at liftoff, and stood 110.64 meters high with the Apollo vehicle on top. The vehicle had three stages: the S-lC, SII, and S-IVB, the last of which burned to send Apollo out of Earth orbit and on its way to the Moon.   The Apollo program greatly increased the pace and complexity of ground operations, both before launch and during the missions, when ground controllers had to track two spacecraft at the same time. The lunar missions also required extensive training. Apollo astronauts logged some 84,000 hours-nearly 10 man years-practicing for their flights: everything from simulations of lunar gravity, to geology field trips, to flying the lunar lander training vehicle.   On January 27, 1967, just as the program was nearing readiness for its first manned flight, tragedy struck. A fire inside an Apollo command module took the lives of astronauts Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee, who were training inside it at the time. The fire resulted in delays and modifications to the spacecraft, but by October 1968, Apollo 7 was ready to carry three astronauts into Earth orbit. There, they checked out the command/service module (both had been tested in an unmanned mode during the November 1967 Apollo 4 mission, which was also the first flight of the Saturn V). By December 1968, Apollo 8 was ready to try for lunar orbit (on the Saturn V's third outing), and seven months later Apollo 11 made the first lunar landing.   By the time the Apollo program ended in 1972, astronauts had extended the range and scope of their lunar explorations. The final three missions were far more sophisticated than the first three, in large part because the astronauts carried a lunar rover that allowed them to roam miles from their base. Apollo 11's Armstrong and Aldrin spent only two-and-a-half hours walking on the surface. On Apollo 17 the Moon walks totaled 22 hours, and the astronauts spent three days ""camped out"" in the Moon's Taurus-Littrow valley.   After six lunar landings the Apollo program came to a conclusion (Apollo 18, 19 and 20 missions had been canceled in 1970 because of budget limitations), and with it ended the first wave of human exploration of the Moon.

Eisele, Walter Cunningham   Apollo 7 was a confidence-builder. After the January 1967 Apollo launch pad fire, the Apollo command module had been extensively redesigned. Schirra, the only astronaut to fly Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions, commanded this Earth-orbital shakedown of the command and service modules. With no lunar lander, Apollo 7 could use the Saturn IB booster rather than the giant Saturn V. The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the Service Propulsion System (SPS) ­ the all-important engine that would place Apollo in and out of lunar orbit-made eight nearly perfect firings. Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, eleven days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. The food was bad, and all three developed colds. But their mission proved the spaceworthiness of the basic Apollo vehicle.      Apollo 8   December 21­27, 1968   Crew: Frank Borman, James A. Lovell, Jr., William A. Anders   The Apollo 8 astronauts were the first human beings to venture beyond low Earth orbit and visit another world. What was originally to have been an Earth­orbit checkout of the lunar lander became instead a race with the Soviets to become the first nation to orbit the Moon. The Apollo 8 crew rode inside the command module, with no lunar lander attached. They were the first astronauts to be launched by the Saturn V, which had flown only twice before. The booster worked perfectly, as did the SPS engines that had been checked out on Apollo 7. Apollo 8 entered lunar orbit on the morning of December 24, 1968. For the next 20 hours the astronauts circled the Moon, which appeared out their windows as a gray, battered wasteland. They took photographs, scouted future landing sites, and on Christmas Eve read from the Book of Genesis to TV viewers back on Earth. They also photographed the first Earthrise as seen from the Moon. Apollo 8 proved the ability to navigate to and from the Moon, and gave a tremendous boost to the entire Apollo program.      Apollo 9   March 3-13, 1969   Crew: James A. McDivitt, David R. Scott, Russell L. Schweickart   Apollo 9 was the first space test of the third critical piece of Apollo hardware-the lunar module. For ten days, the astronauts put all three Apollo vehicles through their paces in Earth orbit, undocking and then redocking the lunar lander with the command module, just as they would in lunar orbit. For this and all subsequent Apollo flights, the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft. The gangly lunar module was ""Spider,"" the command module ""Gumdrop."" Schweickart and Scott performed a space walk, and Schweickart checked out the new Apollo spacesuit, the first to have its own life support system rather than being dependent on an umbilical connection to the spacecraft. Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo machines were up to the task of orbital rendezvous and docking.   Apollo 10   May 18­26, 1969   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford, John W. Young, Eugene A. Cernan   This dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought Stafford and Cernan's lunar module-nicknamed ""Snoopy""-to within nine miles of the lunar surface. Except for that final stretch, the mission went exactly as a landing would have gone, both in space and on the ground, where Apollo's extensive tracking and control network was put through a dry run. Shortly after leaving low Earth orbit, the LM and the command/service module separated, then redocked, top to top. Upon reaching lunar orbit, they separated again. While Young orbited the Moon alone in his command module ""Charlie Brown,"" Stafford and Cernan checked out the LM's radar and ascent engine, rode out a momentary gyration in the lunar lander's motion (due to a faulty switch setting), and surveyed the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquillity. This test article of the lunar module was not equipped to land, however. Apollo 10 also added another first-broadcasting live color TV from space.      Apollo 11   July 16-24, 1969   Crew: Neil A. Armstrong, Michael Collins, Edwin E. ""Buzz"" Aldrin, Jr.   Half of Apollo's primary goal-a safe return-was achieved at 4:17 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on July 20, when Armstrong piloted the ""Eagle"" to a touchdown on the Moon, with less than 30 seconds' worth of fuel left in the lunar module. Six hours later, Armstrong took his famous ""one giant leap for mankind."" Aldrin joined him, and the two spent two-and-a-half hours drilling core samples, photographing what they saw and collecting rocks. After more than 21 hours on the lunar surface, they returned to Collins on board ""Columbia,"" bringing 20.87 kilograms of lunar samples with them. The two Moon-walkers had left behind scientific instruments, an American flag and other mementos, including a plaque bearing the inscription: ""Here Men From Planet Earth First Set Foot Upon the Moon. July 1969 A.D. We Came in Peace For All Mankind.""   Apollo 12   November 14-24, 1969,   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad Jr., Richard F. Gordon, Jr., Alan L. Bean   The second lunar landing was an exercise in precision targeting. The descent was automatic, with only a few manual corrections by Conrad. The landing, in the Ocean of Storms, brought the lunar module ""Intrepid"" within walking distance-182.88 meters-of a robot spacecraft that had touched down there two-and-a-half years earlier. Conrad and Bean brought pieces of the Surveyor 3 back to Earth for analysis, and took two Moon­walks lasting just under four hours each. They collected rocks and set up experiments that measured the Moon's seismicity, solar wind flux and magnetic field. Meanwhile Gordon, on board the ""Yankee Clipper"" in lunar orbit, took multispectral photographs of the surface. The crew stayed an extra day in lunar orbit taking photographs. When ""Intrepid's"" ascent stage was dropped onto the Moon after Conrad and Bean rejoined Gordon in orbit, the seismometers the astronauts had left on the lunar surface registered the vibrations for more than an hour.   Apollo 13   April 11-17, 1970   Crew: James A. Lovell, Jr. Fred W. Haise, Jr., John L. Swigert, Jr.   The crew's understated radio message to Mission Control was ""Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here."" Within 321,860 kilometers of Earth, an oxygen tank in the service module exploded. The only solution was for the crew to abort their planned landing, swing around the Moon and return on a trajectory back to Earth. Since their command module ""Odyssey"" was almost completely dead, however, the three astronauts had to use the lunar module ""Aquarius"" as a crowded lifeboat for the return home. The four-day return trip was cold, uncomfortable and tense. But Apollo 13 proved the program's ability to weather a major crisis and bring the crew back home safely.      Apollo 14   January 31 ­February 9, 1971   Crew: Alan B. Shepard. Jr., Stuart A. Roosa, Edgar D. Mitchell   After landing in the Fra Mauro region-the original destination for Apollo 13-Shepard and Mitchell took two Moon­walks, adding new seismic studies to the by­now familiar Apollo experiment package, and using a ""lunar rickshaw"" pull­cart to carry their equipment. A planned rock­collecting trip to the 1,000­foot­wide Cone Crater was dropped, however, when the astronauts had trouble finding their way around the lunar surface. Although later estimates showed that they had made it to within 30.48 meters of the crater's rim, the explorers had become disoriented in the alien landscape. Roosa, meanwhile, took pictures from on board command module ""Kitty Hawk"" in lunar orbit. On the way back to Earth, the crew conducted the first U.S. materials processing experiments in space. The Apollo 14 astronauts were the last lunar explorers to be quarantined on their return from the Moon.      Apollo 15   July 26­August 7, /971   Crew: David R. Scott, James B. Irwin, Alfred M. Worden   The first of the longer, expedition-style lunar landing missions was also the first to include the lunar rover, a carlike vehicle that extended the astronauts' range. The lunar module Falcon touched down near the sinuous channel known as Hadley Rille. Scott and Irwin rode more than 27.36 kilometers in their rover, and had a free hand in their geological field studies compared to earlier lunar astronauts. They brought back one of the prize trophies of the Apollo program-a sample of ancient lunar crust nicknamed the ""Genesis Rock."" Apollo 15 also launched a small subsatellite for measuring particles and fields in the lunar vicinity. On the way back to Earth, Worden, who had flown solo on board Endeavor while his crewmates walked on the surface, conducted the first space-walk between Earth and the Moon to retrieve film from the side of the spacecraft.   Apollo 16   April 16-27, 1972   Crew: John W. Young, Thomas K. Mattingly II, Charles M. Duke, Jr.   A malfunction in the main propulsion system of the lunar module ""Orion"" nearly caused their Moon landing to be scrubbed but Young and Duke ultimately spent three days exploring the Descarres highland region, while Mattingly circled overhead in ""Casper."" What was thought to have been a region of volcanism turned out not to be, based on the astronauts' discoveries. Their collection of returned specimens included an 11.34-kilogram chunk that was the largest single rock returned by the Apollo astronauts. The Apollo 16 astronauts also conducted performance tests with the lunar rover, at one time getting up to a top speed of 17.70 kilometers per hour.      Apollo 17   December 7-19, 1972   Crew: Eugene A. Cernan, Ronald E. Evans, Harrison H. ""Jack"" Schmitt   The last man to set foot on the Moon was also the first scientist-astronaut/geologist Harrison Schmitt. While Evans circled in ""America,"" Schmitt and Cernan collected a record 108.86 kilograms of rocks during three Moonwalks. The crew roamed for 33.80 kilometers through the Taurus-Littrow valley in their rover, discovered orange-colored soil, and left behind a plaque attached to their lander Challenger, which read: ""Here Man completed his first exploration of the Moon, December 1972 A.D. May the spirit of peace in which we came be reflected in the lives of all mankind."" The Apollo lunar program had ended.   Apollo 17: Splashdown in the Pacific.     Skylab    NASA had studied concepts for space stations, including an inflatable donut-shaped station, since the earliest days of the space program. But it wasn't until the Saturn rocket came into existence in the mid-1960s that the Skylab program was born. Initially called the Apollo Applications Program, Skylab was designed to use leftover Apollo lunar hardware to achieve extended stays by astronauts in Earth orbit.   At first there were two competing concepts: the so-called ""wet"" workshop, where a Saturn IB would be launched, fueled, and its S IV-B upper stage vented and refurbished in orbit; and the ""dry"" workshop, where the outfitting of an empty S IV-B stage would be done on the ground beforehand and launched on a Saturn V. In July 1969, while the Apollo 11 astronauts were completing their historic lunar landing mission, program managers made their decision: the ""dry"" workshop concept won.   The Skylab space station weighed approximately 100 tons. It was placed into orbit by the Saturn V, the last time that giant launcher was used. Three separate astronaut crews then met up with the orbiting workshop using modified Apollo command and service modules launched by smaller Saturn IB rockets.   Skylab had a habitable volume of just over 283.17 cubic meters. It was divided into two levels separated by a metal floor-actually an open grid into which the astronauts' cleated shoes could be locked. The ""upper"" floor had storage lockers and a large empty volume for conducting experiments, plus two scientific airlocks, one pointing down at the Earth, the other toward the Sun. The lower floor had compartmented ""rooms"" with many of the comforts of home: a dining room table, three bedrooms, a work area, a shower and a bathroom.   The largest piece of scientific equipment, attached to one end of the cylindrical workshop, was the Apollo Telescope Mount, used to study the Sun in different wavelengths with no atmospheric interference. The ATM had its own electricity-generating solar panels.   Skylab also had an airlock module for space-walks (required for repairs, experiment deployments and routine changing of film in the ATM). The Apollo command/service module remained attached to the station's multiple docking adapter while the astronauts were on board.   The space station itself was launched May 14, 1973, on the unmanned Skylab 1 mission. Beginning only 63 seconds after the launch, however, the workshop's combination meteorite shield and sunshade was torn loose by aerodynamic stress, taking one of the two electricity­producing solar arrays with it and preventing the other from deploying properly. The crew was supposed to have launched the next day, but they waited on the ground for 10 days while a fix was worked out (see Skylab 2).   In the course of the next nine months, three different crews lived on board Skylab for one, two, then three months at a time. The station, which orbited at an altitude of 434.52 kilometers, was deactivated between flights. The nine Skylab astronauts chalked up a total of 513 man-days in orbit, during which they conducted thousands of experiments and observations, studying (in decreasing order of the amount of crew time spent): solar astronomy, life sciences, Earth observations, astrophysics, man/systems studies, Comet Kohoutek observations (Skylab 4 only), materials science and student experiments.   Skylab showed the value of having humans working for long periods in orbit on a wide variety of scientific studies, and proved that they could survive the ordeal. More than five years after the last crew left, the empty Skylab station reentered and burned up in the atmosphere on July 11, 1979.      Skylab   Dates : 1973-74   Vehicles : Skylab orbital workshop   Saturn IB launch vehicle (for crews)   Number of People Flown : 9   Highlights : Longest duration space flights in U.S. history   NASA Sources :   Compton, W.

Skylab 2   May 25­June 22, 1973   Crew: Charles ""Pete"" Conrad Jr., Paul J. Weitz, Joseph P. Kewin   The first crew to visit the Skylab space station started their mission with home repairs. Skylab's meteorite and sunshield had torn loose during launch, and one of its two remaining solar panels was jammed (see above). Due to concerns that high temperatures inside the workshop- the result of no sunshield-would release toxic materials and ruin on­board film and food, the crew had to work fast. After a failed attempt to deploy the stuck solar panel, they set up a ""parasol"" as a replacement sunshade. The ""fix"" worked, and temperatures inside dropped low enough that the crew could enter. Two weeks later Conrad and Kerwin conducted a space-walk, and after a struggle, were able to free the stuck solar panel and begin electricity flowing to their new ""home."" For nearly a month they made further repairs to the workshop, conducted medical experiments, gathered solar and Earth science data and returned some 29,000 frames of film. The Skylab 2 astronauts spent 28 days in space, which doubled the previous U.S. record.      Skylab 3   July28­September 25, 1973   Crew: Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma, Owen K. Garriott   After an early bout of motion sickness, the three-person Skylab 3 crew settled down to a 59-day stay on board the space station. During the flight, Garriott and Lousma deployed a second sun shield on a space-walk lasting six and a half hours- the first and longest of three Skylab 3 space-walks. During their two months in orbit, the astronauts continued a busy schedule of experiments, including a student experiment to see if spiders could spin webs in weightlessness (they could). They also tested a jet-powered Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU) backpack inside the spacious volume of Skylab's forward compartment, which had been carried but never flown on Gemini missions in the 1960s. The AMU proved a capable form of one-man space transportation, and helped engineers design the more sophisticated Manned Maneuvering Unit used on the Space Shuttle in the 1980s.   Skylab 4   November 16, 1973­February 8, 1974   Crew: Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue, Edward G. Gibson   At 84 days, 1 hour, 15 minutes, and 31 seconds, Skylab 4 remains the longest U.S. space flight to date. To help keep the crew in shape, a treadmill was added to the on-board bicycle like ergometer. As a result of the exercise, the Skylab 4 crew was in better physical condition upon their return to Earth than previous Skylab crews, even though an excessive work pace had caused some tension during the flight. Comet Kohoutek was among the special targets observed by the Skylab 4 crew, as were a solar eclipse and solar flares. The astronauts also conducted four space-walks, including one on Christmas Day to view Kohoutek, and set records for time spent on experiments in every discipline from medical investigations to materials science.             Apollo-Soyuz    The final mission of the Apollo era, in July 1975, was the first in which spacecraft from two nations rendezvoused and docked in orbit. The idea for this U.S./Soviet ""handshake in space"" had been initiated three years earlier with an agreement signed by U.S. President Nixon and Soviet President Kosygin.   The American crew for this goodwill flight included Thomas Stafford, a veteran of three flights, Vance Brand, who had never flown in space, and Mercury astronaut Deke Slayton, the only one of the original seven astronauts who had never flown (due to a heart condition). The American astronauts traveled into orbit inside a three-man Apollo spacecraft.   Like the Apollo command module, the two­man Soyuz capsule flown by the Soviets had debuted in 1967. On board the Soviet spacecraft were Alexei Leonov, who had made history's first space-walk in 1965, and rookie Valeri Kubasov.   The Apollo-Soyuz mission, aside from its political significance, resulted in a number of technical developments, including a common docking system, which had to be specially designed so that the different spacecraft could connect in orbit. The joint mission also gave both ""sides"" a view of one another's space programs. In preparation for the flight, Soviet cosmonauts and their backups visited and trained at the Johnson Space Center, and the American crew and their backups paid visits to Moscow. Flight controllers from both nations also conducted joint simulations.   Although Apollo-Soyuz was a one-time-only event, it created a sense of goodwill that transcended the simple ""handshake in space"" that was its most visible symbol.   Apollo­Soyuz Test Project   July 15 - 24, 1975   Crew: Thomas P. Stafford, Vince D. Brand, Donald K. ""Deke"" Slayton   The Soyuz 19 and Apollo 18 craft launched within seven-and-a-half hours of each other July 15, and docked on July 17. Three hours later, Stafford and Leonov exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz. The two spacecraft remained linked for 44 hours, long enough for the three Americans and two Soviets to exchange flags and gifts (including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries), sign certificates, pay visits to each other's ships, eat together and converse in each other's languages. There were also docking and redocking maneuvers during which the Soyuz reversed roles and became the ""active"" ship. The Soviets remained in space for five days, the Americans for nine, during which the Soviets also conducted experiments in Earth observation.

(MISSING GRAPHICS)          Space Shuttle    Before the Space Shuttle, launching cargo into space was a one-way proposition. Satellites could be sent into orbit, but could not return. The world's first reusable space vehicle changed that, and revolutionized the way people worked in space.   The Space Shuttle was approved as a national program in 1972. Part spacecraft and part aircraft, it required several technological advances, including thousands of insulating tiles able to stand the heat of reentry over the course of many missions, and sophisticated engines that could be used again and again without being thrown away.   The airplane-like orbiter has three of these Space Shuttle Main Engines, which burn liquid hydrogen and oxygen stored in the large External Tank, the single largest structure in the Shuttle ""stack."" Attached to the tank are two Solid Rocket Boosters, which provide most of the vehicle's thrust at liftoff. Two minutes into the flight, the spent solids drop into the ocean to be recovered, while the orbiter's own engines continue burning until approximately eight minutes into the flight.   The Shuttle was developed throughout the 1970s. Enterprise, a test vehicle not suited for space flight, was used for approach and landing tests in 1977 that demonstrated the orbiter's aerodynamic qualities and ability to land (after separating from an airplane). The first spaceworthy Shuttle orbiter, Columbia, made its orbital debut in April 1981.   The first four missions of the new Space Transportation System (STS) were test flights to evaluate the Shuttle's engineering design, thermal characteristics and performance in space. Operational flights began with STS-5 in November 1982, with a four-person crew on board. Over time the crews grew in size: five people flew on STS-7 in 1983, six on STS-9 later that same year. The first seven-person crew flew on STS 41-C in 1984, and in 1985 eight people-a Shuttle record- flew on STS 61-A.   The Space Shuttle changed the sociology of space flight. With such large crews, Shuttle astronauts were divided into two categories: pilots responsible for flying and maintaining the orbiter, and mission specialists responsible for experiments and payloads. A new class of space traveler, payload specialists-who are not even necessarily career astronauts-also was created to tend to specific onboard experiments.   The reusable Shuttles together make up a fleet, with each vehicle continually being processed on the ground in preparation for its next flight. The second orbiter, Challenger, debuted in 1983, followed by Discovery in 1984 and Atlantis in 1985. A fifth orbiter, Endeavour, joined the fleet in 1991, to make its first flight in 1992.   The Space Transportation System introduced several new tools to the business of space flight. The Remote Manipulator System, a 15.24-meter crane built by the Canadian Space Agency and designed to mimic the human arm, is able to move large and heavy payloads in and out of the Shuttle's 18.29-meter-long cargo bay. The Spacelab module, built by the European Space Agency, provides a pressurized and fully equipped laboratory for scientists to conduct experiments ranging in subject matter from astronomy to materials science to biomedical investigations. The Manned Maneuvering Unit backpack allows space-walking astronauts to ""fly"" up to several hundred meters from the orbiter with no connecting tether.   The MMU has figured in several of the Shuttle program's most spectacular accomplishments. On STS 41-C in April 1984, the ailing Solar Max satellite was retrieved, repaired, and reorbited by the astronaut crew, all on the same flight. Later that same year, on STS 51-A, two malfunctioning commercial communications satellites were retrieved in orbit and brought back to Earth in the Shuttle cargo bay. Another malfunctioning satellite was fixed in orbit by the crew of STS 51-I in 1985.   Early in the Shuttle program, communications satellites were common payloads, with as many as three delivered into orbit on the same mission. The January 1986 Challenger accident, which resulted in the loss of the crew and vehicle due to a failed seal in one of the two Solid Rocket Boosters, led to a change in that policy, however. Since returning to flight in September 1988, the Shuttle has carried only those payloads unique to the Shuttle or those that require a human presence. The majority of these have been scientific and defense missions. Among those payloads have been some of the decade's most important space science projects, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Galileo Jupiter spacecraft, and the Gamma Ray Observatory.   In 1995, the Shuttle program added a new capability to its repertoire. In preparation for deployment of the International Space Station, the crew of the Space Shuttle began a series of eight dockings and five crew exchanges with the Russian space station Mir. U.S. astronauts spent time aboard the Mir-sometimes several months at a time-acclimating themselves to living and working in space. They carried out many of the types of activities they would perform on the Space Station and encountered conditions they would possibly encounter.   The Space Shuttle continues today as the nation's most capable form of space transportation. By early 1998, over the course of 89 missions, Shuttle missions had carried 516 people into space, spent a total of 757 days in space, and circled the Earth almost 12,000 times.

In space, Young and Crippen tested the Columbia's onboard systems; fired the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) used for changing orbits and the Reaction Control System (RCS) engines used for attitude control; opened and closed the payload bay doors (the bay was empty for this first flight); and, after 36 orbits, made a smooth touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base in California, the landing site for most of the early Shuttle missions.   STS­2   November 12­14, 1981   Columbia   Crew: Engle, Truly   Originally intended to last five days, the Shuttle's second test flight was cut short when problems developed with one of three onboard fuel cells that produce electricity. Engle   and Truly conducted the first tests of the 50-foot Remote Manipulator System arm and operated the Shuttle's first payload: a package of Earth-viewing instruments stored in the cargo bay.   STS-3   March 22-30, 1982   Columbia   Crew: Lousma, Fullerton   The longest of the Shuttle test flights carried space-viewing instruments for the first time. The crew also continued engineering evaluations of Columbia. After rains flooded the dry lakebed at the primary landing site in California, the Columbia made the Shuttle program's only landing to date at White Sands, New Mexico.   STS­4   June 27-July 4, 1982   Columbia   Crew: Mattingly, Hartsfield   The last Shuttle test flight was the first mission to carry payloads for the Department of Defense. It also included the first small ""Getaway Special"" experiments mounted in the cargo bay, and further tested the mechanical and thermal performance of the Columbia, as well as the environment surrounding the spacecraft. Mattingly made the first Shuttle landing on a concrete runway instead of the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base.      STS-5   November 11-16, 1982   Columbia   Crew; Brand, Overmeyer J. Allen, Lenior   The Shuttle's first operational mission also was the first space flight with four people on board. Two commercial communications satellites, SBS-3 and Anik C-3, were launched into orbit from the cargo bay-another first-using the Payload Assist Module (PAM) upper stage designed for the Shuttle. A planned space-walk was canceled when problems developed with the two on-board spacesuits.      STS­6   April 4­9, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Weitz, Bobko, Peterson, Musgrave   Challenger's debut flight included the Shuttle program's first space-walks. Musgrave and Peterson spent more than four hours testing new Shuttle spacesuits and mobility aids, and evaluated their own ability to work outside in the Shuttle's cargo bay. The first of NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellites was launched. The communications satellite initially failed to reach its proper orbit due to an upper stage guidance error, but was eventually maneuvered into the correct position.   STS­7   June 18-24, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, Hauck, Ride, Fabian, Thagard   Except for Crippen, all the members of this crew were from the ""class"" of 1978, the first astronauts chosen for the Shuttle program. STS-7 had a record five people on board, including Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. The crew deployed, rendezvoused with and retrieved the German-built SPAS experiment platform, which took the first full pictures of a Shuttle orbiter in space. The crew also released two communications satellites-Anik C-2 and Palapa B-l- into orbit, and activated a series of materials processing experiments fixed in the Challenger's cargo bay.         STS­8   August 30­September 5, 1983   Challenger   Crew: Truly, Brandenstein, Blaford, D. Gardner, W. Thornton   STS-8 featured the Shuttle program's first night launch and landing. The crew launched India's INSAT 1-B communications satellite, conducted the first tests of Shuttle-to-ground communications with the new Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and exercised the Remote Manipulator ""arm"" with a test article weighing nearly four tons. Thornton, an M.D., conducted biomedical experiments, and Bluford became the first African-American in space.      STS­9   November 28­December 8, 1983   Columbia   Crew: Young, Shaw, Parker, Garriott. PS: Byron Lichtenberg, Ulf Merbold   The first flight of the European-built Spacelab module was a multidisciplinary science mission, with 71 experiments in a wide range of fields: space physics, materials processing, life sciences, Earth and atmospheric studies, astronomy and solar physics. The record six­person crew included the first Shuttle payload specialists: Lichtenberg of MIT, and Merbold, a West German physicist who became the first non-U.S. citizen to fly on an American spacecraft.      41-B   February 3-11, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Brand, Gibson, McCandless, Stewart, McNair   With this flight, the number designations for Shuttle missions changed. The ""4"" indicates the (originally scheduled) year of the launch-1984. The second digit represents the launch site (""1"" for Florida, ""2"" for California), and the ""B"" indicates the second launch of the fiscal year. The highlights of the flight were the first untethered space-walks by McCandless and Stewart, who tested new Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) backpacks that allowed them to travel as far as 97.54 meters from the orbiter. Two satellites deployed from the Shuttle, Westar VI and Palapa B-2, failed to reach their proper orbits when their PAM upper stages did not ignite. Both were later retrieved and brought back to Earth (see STS 51-A). Challenger made the Shuttle's first landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.      41­C   April 6-13, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, Scobee, Hart, van Hoften, Nelson   In the space program's first satellite service call, the crew rendezvoused with and retrieved the Solar Maximum Mission (Solar Max) satellite, which had failed after four years in orbit. With the satellite anchored in Challenger's cargo bay, Nelson and van Hoften replaced a faulty attitude control system and one science instrument, and the repaired satellite was re-released into orbit. The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), a passive satellite for testing the effects of space exposure on different materials, also was deployed on the flight. Originally LDEF was to have remained in orbit for only ten months, but it was not returned to Earth until STS-32 in January 1990.      41­D   August 30-September 5, 1984   Discovery   Crew: Hartsfield, Coats, Mullane, Hawley, Resnik, PS: Charles Walker   The first flight of Discovery was the first Shuttle mission to deploy three communications satellites: Syncom IV-2, SBS-4 and Telstar 3-C. The crew also experimented with a 31.09-meter-high solar cell array, which was unfurled from a stowage container only 177.8 millimeters deep located in the cargo bay. The experiments included testing the structure's stability when the Shuttle's attitude control engines were fired. Walker, a McDonnell Douglas engineer, was the Shuttle's first commercially sponsored payload specialist, on board to tend to the company's Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System for separating materials in microgravity.   41­G   October 5­13, 1984   Challenger   Crew: Crippen, McBride, Leestma, Ride, Sullivan. PS: Paul Scully-Power, Marc Garneau   The Shuttle's first seven-member crew included two payload specialists. Scully-Power, a Navy oceanographer, was on board to observe ocean dynamics from orbit. Garneau, the first Canadian in space, operated the multidisciplinary CANEX (Canadian Experiment) package. In Challenger's cargo bay was a suite of instruments dedicated to Earth observation­the primary purpose of this mission. During a three-and-a-half hour space-walk, Sullivan and Leestma also tested connections for an orbital refueling system in the bay. Sullivan was the first American woman to walk in space.      51-A   November 8­16, 1984   Discovery   Crew: Hauck, Walker, J. Allen, A. Fisher, D. Gardner   The STS 51-A crew delivered two satellites-Anik D-2 and Syncom IV-I- into orbit, then brought two others-Palapa B­2 and Westar VI, whose on-board boosters had failed after being deployed on STS 41-B-back to Earth. In separate space-walks using Manned Maneuvering Unit backpacks, Gardner and Allen each docked with an orbiting satellite, stopped its rotation, then assisted as it was stowed in Discovery's cargo bay. Both satellites were then returned for refurbishment on the ground in a dramatic demonstration of the Shuttle's salvage capability.      5l -C   January 24­27, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Mattingly, Shriver, Onizuka, Buchli. PS: Gary Payton   The crew for the Shuttle's first flight dedicated to the Department of Defense included payload specialist Gary Payton of the U.S. Air Force. The cargo, as well as details of the mission, was classified.   51-D   April 12-19, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Bobko, Williams, Hoffman, Griggs, Seddon PS: Charles Walker, Jake Garn   When a booster attached to Syncom IV-3, the second of two communications satellites released into orbit (the other was Anik C- l ), failed to ignite, the crew, with the help of engineers on the ground, attempted a fix. Hoffman and Griggs took an unscheduled space-walk to attach an improvised ""flyswatter"" device to the Remote Manipulator System arm, in the hope that it could trip the satellite booster's sequence start lever. The plan failed, however, and the satellite was eventually ""jump-started"" by STS 51-I astronauts four months later. Utah Senator Jake Garn was the first member of Congress to fly in space.      5I-B   April 29-May 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Overmeyer, F. Gregory, Lind, Thagard, W. Thornton PS: Taylor Wand, Lodewijk van den Berg   The Shuttle's second Spacelab mission included 15 experiments in materials processing, fluid behavior, atmospheric physics, astronomy and life sciences. The crew worked around the clock in shifts, and had trouble with a leaky animal-holding facility making its first test flight. Wang, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist, concentrated on studies of fluid behavior in microgravity, while van den Berg of EG&G, Inc. focused on crystal growth experiments. Lind, an astronaut since 1966, made his first space flight.   51-G   June 17­ 24, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Brandenstein, Creighton, Fabian, Nagel. Lucid PS: Patrick Bandry, Sultan Sa/man Abdul Azziz Al Sa'ud   Baudry of France and Al Sa'ud of Saudi Arabia were the international payload specialists for this flight, which successfully launched three communications satellites into orbit: Morelos-1, Arabsat 1-B and Telstar 3-D. SPARTAN-I, a reusable free-flying payload carrier with astronomy instruments on board, also was released, then retrieved, by the Remote Manipulator System arm. The crew conducted materials science and biomedical experiments and participated in a Defense Department tracking experiment in which a laser beam directed from Hawaii was bounced from a reflector on board Discovery back to the ground.   51-F   July 29-August 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Fullerton, Bridges, Musgrave, England, Henize. PS: Loren Acton, John-David Bartoe   The Spacelab 2 mission replaced the Spacelab's enclosed ""long module"" with open pallets containing 13 instruments dedicated to astronomy. Despite problems with an instrument pointing system, the crew was able to collect data on the Sun and other celestial targets. Earlier in the flight, Challenger made the Shuttle program's first ""abort to orbit"" when one of its three main engines shut down during the ascent. Henize and England had waited a long time for a space flight-both had been astronauts during the Apollo era. England had resigned from NASA in 1972, only to rejoin the astronauts corps in 1979.   51-I   August 27-September 3, 1985   Discovery   Crew: Engle, Corey, van Hoften, W. Fisher, Lounge   The Syncom IV-3 satellite (also known as ""Leasat'') stranded in orbit on STS 5I-D was repaired and re-boosted as a result of two space-walks by van Hoften and Fisher that were among the most challenging in the history of the space program. After van Hoften, standing on the end of the Remote Manipulator System arm, grabbed the satellite manually, he and Fisher worked on the satellite in Discovery's cargo bay. The astronauts attached hardware that allowed ground crews to activate Syncom's still-live rocket motor after van Hoften re-released it into orbit with a shove from the cargo bay. Earlier in the flight, the crew had launched three new communications satellites into orbit: ASC-1,   AUSSAT-I and Syncom IV-4 (nearly identical to the one that was rescued).      51-J   October 3­7, 1985   Atlantis   Crew: Bobko, Grabe, Hilmers, Stewart. PS: William Pailes   The first flight of Atlantis was the second Shuttle mission dedicated to the Department of Defense. The payload and on-board activities were classified.   61­A   October 30­November 6, 1985   Challenger   Crew: Hartsfield, Nagel, Bachli, Bluford, Dunbar. PS: Reinhard Furrer, Wubbo Ockels, Ernst Messerschmid   The Spacelab D-1 mission was the first U.S. manned space flight with a primary payload sponsored by another country-West Germany. On board were 76 experiments, including investigations in fluid physics, materials science, plant physiology and human adaptation to weightlessness. Science experiments were directed from a German Space Operations Center in Oberpfaffenhofen, and two of the payload specialists-Furrer and Messerschmid-were German. With eight people working around the clock in shifts, it was the largest Shuttle crew to date.   61-B   November 26-December 3, 1985   Atlantis   Crew: Shaw, O'Connor, Spring, Cleave, Ross, PS: Charles Walker, Rodolfo Neri Vela   After the crew deployed three communications satellites (SATCOM Ku-2, Morelos 2 and AUSSAT-2) Spring and Ross conducted the first construction experiments in space, assembling and disassembling two tinkertoy-like structures called EASE and ACCESS in the cargo bay of Atlantis. The two space-walking astronauts attached beams, nodes and struts to evaluate different methods of assembling large structures in space. Vela was the first Mexican citizen in orbit, while Walker made his third flight with the commercially sponsored electrophoresis experiment.   61-C   January 12-18, 1986   Columbia   Crew: Gibson, Bolden, Nelson, Hawley, Chang-Diaz. PS: Robert Cenker, Bill Nelson   Rep. Bill Nelson of Florida was the second member of Congress to fly on the Shuttle. The crew deployed an RCA communications satellite and conducted a number of smaller experiments, including several materials science investigations mounted in the cargo bay of the Columbia. An attempt to photograph Comet Halley through an overhead window was unsuccessful, however, due to problems with the instrument's battery.   51­L   January 28, 1986   Challenger   Crew: Scobee, Smith, Onizuka, Resnik, McNair. PS: Gregory Jarvis, Christa McAuliffe   Challenger and all seven members of the crew-including Jarvis, a Hughes employee, and Christa McAuliffe, the designated ""Teacher in Space""-were lost 73 seconds into the flight when the vehicle exploded as the result of a leak in one of two Solid Rocket Boosters. The Shuttle program was delayed for nearly three years while the boosters were redesigned and other safety measures were added. A change in U.S. space policy also resulted from the accident-no longer would the Shuttle carry commercial satellites into orbit.      STS-26   September 29-October 3, 1988   Discovery   Crew: Hauck, Covey, Lounge, Nelson, Hilmers   The first Shuttle mission after the Challenger accident was a conservative, four-day flight that proved the safety of the redesigned Solid Rocket Boosters. On board the Discovery was the first all-veteran astronaut crew since Apollo 11. During launch and reentry, the astronauts wore new partial-pressure flight suits, and in orbit they practiced using a new emergency escape system. The principal payload was a NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite similar to the one lost on STS 51-L, which was released into orbit on the first day.   STS­27   December 2-6, 1988   Atlantis   Crew: Gibson, G. Garner, Mullone, Ross, Shepherd   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­29   March 13­18. 1989   Discovery   Crew: Coats, Blaha, Buchli, Springer, Bagian   Six hours into the mission, the crew released the fourth NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite into orbit. The astronauts conducted experiments in plant growth, crystal growth and the human body's adaptation to weightlessness, and tested a new Shuttle ""fax"" machine. They also took large-format IMAX movie pictures of the Earth, and returned clear photographs of the jettisoned external fuel tank in space.   STS­30   May 4­8, 1989   Atlantis   Crew: Walker, Grabe, Thagard, Cleave, Lee   The Shuttle program's first launch of a planetary spacecraft came on the first day of the mission, when the Magellan Venus Radar Mapper was released from the Atlantis' cargo bay with an Inertial Upper Stage booster attached. The booster fired shortly thereafter to send Magellan to Venus, where it arrived in August 1990 to begin an eight-month mapping mission. Secondary experiments after the deployment included crystal growth studies and a search for thunderstorms in the atmosphere below, called the Mesoscale Lightning Experiment.      STS-28   August 8-13, 1989   Columbia   Crew: Shaw, Richards, Leestma, Adamson, M. Brown   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­34   October 18­23, 1989   Atlantis   Crew: Williams, McCulley, Lucid, E. Baker, Chang-Diaz   The Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft was the Shuttle's second interplanetary cargo. Galileo's mission got underway during Atlantis' fifth orbit around the Earth, when the spacecraft was released from the cargo bay to head toward Venus, the first ""stop"" on its voyage to Jupiter. After releasing Galileo, the crew worked on experiments that included materials science, plant growth and measurements of ozone in the atmosphere.   STS­33   November 22­27. 1989   Discovery   Crew: F. Gregory, Blaha, Musgrave, K. Thornton, Carter   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­32   January 9-20, 1990   Columbia   Crew: Brandenstein, Wetherbee, Dunbar, Low, Ivins   The Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), released into orbit on STS 41-C in 1984, was finally retrieved after nearly six years in space. After rendezvousing with the large, cylindrical satellite-one of the most complicated space rendezvous operations ever-the crew photographed the LDEF in orbit, grappled it with the Remote Manipulator System arm, then stowed it in the cargo bay of the Columbia. Scientists who examined the LDEF after landing found evidence of erosion and micrometeorite impacts, as expected. A Syncom satellite also was deployed on the mission. Lasting almost 11 days, STS-32 was the longest Shuttle flight to date.   STS­36   February 28-March 4, 1990   Atlantis   Crew: Creighton, Casper, Hilmers, Mullane, Thuot   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS-31   April 24­29, 1990   Discovery   Crew: Shriver, Bolden, Hawley, McCandless, Sullivan   The Hubble Space Telescope, the first large optical telescope ever to be placed above the Earth's atmosphere and the first of NASA's ""Great Observatories,"" was released into orbit by the Remote Manipulator System arm on the second day of the flight to begin at least a decade of astronomical observations in space. After the telescope was deployed, the astronauts conducted experiments in crystal growth and monitored the radiation environment on board the orbiter. Because of the need to place the telescope above most of the atmosphere, the Discovery flew the highest Shuttle orbit to date, reaching an altitude of more than 531.08 kilometers.   STS-41   October 6­10, 1990   Discovery   Crew: Richards, Cabana, Mellnick, Shepherd, Akers   Deployment of the European Space Agency's Ulysses spacecraft to explore the polar regions of the Sun was the highlight of this four-day mission. On the first day of the flight, the crew sprung Ulysses from Discovery's cargo bay, and on-board rockets fired to send the spacecraft toward a gravity assist at Jupiter. After the deploy, the astronauts conducted a number of secondary experiments, including taking measurements of atmospheric ozone, studying the effects of atomic oxygen on spacecraft materials and evaluating a new ""hands-off"" voice command system in the Shuttle crew cabin.   STS­38   November 15­20, 1990   Atlantis   Crew: Corey, Culbertson, Springer, Meade, Gemar   Classified mission for the Department of Defense.   STS­35   December 2­10, 1990   Columbia   Crew: Brand, Gardner, Hoffman, Lounge, Parker. PS: Ronald Parise, Samuel Durrance   STS-35 was the first Spacelab mission since the Challenger accident, and the first Shuttle flight dedicated to a single discipline: astrophysics. Discovery carried a group of astronomical telescopes called ASTRO-1 in its cargo bay, as well as four Ph.D.'s in astronomy: Hoffman, Parker, Durrance of Johns Hopkins University, and Parise of the Computer Science Corporation. Despite several hardware malfunctions, the crew was able to make observations of a wide variety of astronomical targets, from comets to quasars, with particular attention to x-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths.   STS-37   April 5-11, 1991   Atlantis   Crew: Nagel. Cameron. Apt, Godwin, Ross   The Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO), was released by Atlantis Remote Manipulator System arm on the third day of the flight, after Ross and Apt made an unscheduled space-walk to repair an antenna on the spacecraft. The second of NASA's ""Great Observatories"" designed for a long-term program of astronomical observations from Earth orbit, the GRO was the heaviest science satellite ever launched from the Shuttle. Later in the mission, Ross and Apt returned to the cargo bay to rest rail-mounted mechanical pushcarts planned for use on Space Station Freedom. The two space-walks were the first in more than five years.      STS­39   April 28 - May 6, 1991   Discovery   Crew: Coats, Hammond, Bluford, Harbaugh, Hieb, McMonagle, Veach   The first unclassified defense-related mission of the Shuttle program included experiments sponsored by the Air Force and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) organization. The studies included extensive infrared, ultraviolet, visible and x-ray observations of the space environment and the Shuttle itself. On-board instruments also returned high-quality images of the Earth's aurora. In an experiment related to ballistic­missile defense, Discovery released a SPAS instrument platform equipped with infrared sensors to fly in formation and observe rocket thruster plumes as the Shuttle performed a complicated series of maneuvers.      STS­40   June 5-14, 1991   Columbia   Crew: O'Connor. Gutierrez. Bagian.   Jernigan. Seldon PS: F. Drew Gaffney, Millie Hughes-Fulford   The Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS-1) mission was the first dedicated entirely to understanding the physiological effects of space flight. An extensive series of biomedical experiments were conducted on crew members during the nine-day mission, and the results were compared with baseline data collected on the ground before and after the flight. Along with the human subjects, rodents and jellyfish also were on board to test their adaptation to microgravity.   STS-43   August 2-11, 1991   Atlantis   Crew: Blaha, Baker, Adamson, Low, Lucid   This mission marked the first scheduled landing at Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility since January 1986. The Tracking/Data Relay Satellite-5 was the mission's primary payload. The satellite became the fourth member of the orbiting TDRS cluster, which now consisted of two operating satellites plus two spares in the space network.

STS-49   May 7-16, 1992   Endeavour   Crew: Brandenstein, Chilton, Melnick, Akers, Hieb, Thornton, Thuot   STS-49 was marked by a number of ""firsts."" Four space walks, the most ever on a single mission, highlighted the first voyage of the orbiter Endeavour. Two of these were the longest in U.S. space flight history to date, lasting eight hours and 29 minutes and seven hours and 45 minutes. The flight also featured the longest space walk to date by a female astronaut and was the first space flight where three crew members worked outside the spacecraft at the same time. It also was the first time that astronauts attached a live rocket motor to an orbiting satellite. The crew also successfully captured and redeployed the Intelsat-VI satellite, which had been stranded in an unusable orbit since its launch in March 1990.

STS-46   July 31-August 8, 1992   Atlantis   Crew: Shriver, Allen, Hoffman, Chang-Diaz, Ivins, Nicollier, PS: Franco Malerba   The primary mission objective was deployment of the European Space Agency's European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) and operation of the NASA-Italian Tethered Satellite System (TSS). After a delay and a shorter-than-planned thruster firing, the satellite was successfully boosted to operational orbit. During TSS deployment, the satellite at the end of the tether reached a distance of only 256 meters rather than its planned 20 kilometers because of a jammed tether line. The satellite it carried was restowed for return to Earth.   STS-47   September 12-20, 1992   Endeavour   Crew: Gibson, Brown, Lee, Davis, Apt, Jemison, PS: Mamoru Mohri   Spacelab-J, the first Japanese Spacelab, debuted on this flight. Jointly sponsored by NASA and the National Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan, the mission included 24 materials science and 19 life sciences experiments. Test subjects included members of the crew, Japanese koi fish, cultured animal and plant cells, chicken embryos, fruit flies, fungi and plant seeds, and frogs and frog eggs. The crew also included the first African-American woman to fly in space, Mae Jemison the first married couple (Mark Lee and Jan Davis), and the first Japanese person to fly on the Shuttle, Mamoru Mohri.   STS-52   October 22-November 1, 1992   Columbia   Crew: Wetherbee, Baker, Veach, Jernigan, Shepherd, PS: Steven MacLean   The mission deployed the Laser Geodynamic Satellite II (LAGEOS), a joint effort of NASA and the Italian Space Agency, and operated the U.S. Microgravity Payload-1 (USMP-1). LAGEOS was boosted into orbit by the Italian Research Interim Stage (IRIS), its first use. Studies focused on the influence of gravity on basic fluid and solidification processes.   STS-53   December 2-9, 1992   Discovery   Crew: Walker, Cabana, Bluford, Voss, Clifford   This was the last Shuttle flight for the Department of Defense. The Discovery deployed a classified payload, after which flight activities became unclassified. Ten secondary payloads were contained in or attached to Get Away Special hardware in the cargo bay or located on the middeck.   STS-54   January 13-19, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Casper, McMonagle, Runco, Harbaugh, Helms   The fifth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-6), part of NASA's orbiting communications system, was deployed on this mission. On the fifth day of the flight, mission specialists Runco and Harbaugh spent almost five hours walking in the open payload bay, performing a series of extravehicular activity (EVA) tasks designed to increase NASA's knowledge of working in space. The astronauts tested their abilities to move freely in the cargo bay, climb into foot restraints without using their hands, and simulated carrying large objects in a microgravity environment. A Hitchhiker experiment collected data on stars and galactic gases.   STS-56   April 8-17, 1993   Discovery   Crew: Cameron, Oswald, Cockrell, Foale, Ochoa   The primary payload was the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-2 (ATLAS-2), which collected data on the relationship between the sun's energy output and the Earth's middle atmosphere and their affect on the ozone layer. ATLAS-2 was one element of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth program. The crew also used the remote manipulator arm to deploy the SPARTAN-201, a free-flying science instrument platform that studied velocity and acceleration of solar wind and observed the sun's corona. Using the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment II (SAREX II), the crew also contacted schools around the world and briefly contacted the Russian Mir space station, the first contact between the Shuttle and Mir using amateur radio equipment.   STS-55   April 26-May 6, 1993   Columbia   Crew: Nagel, Henricks, Ross, Precourt, Harris, PS: Ulrich Walter, Hans W. Schlegel   This mission marked the second German Spacelab mission, designated D2. Around-the-clock crews conducted some 88 experiments, covering materials and life sciences, technology applications, Earth observations, astronomy, and atmospheric physics.   STS-57   June 21-July 1, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Grabe, Duffy, Low, Sherlock, Voss, Wisoff   STS-57 marked the first flight of the commercially developed SPACEHAB, a laboratory designed to more than double pressurized workspace for crew-tended experiments. Altogether, 22 experiments were flown, covering materials and life sciences, and a wastewater recycling experiment for the future Space Station. A five-hour, 50-minute space walk succeeded in retrieving and stowing the 4,275-kilogram EURECA science satellite inside the Endeavour's payload bay. The satellite had been deployed on the STS-46 mission in 1992. Two crew members also carried out maneuvers using the robot arm. During the mission, the crew also spoke with President Clinton.   STS-51   September 12-22, 1993   Discovery   Crew: Culbertson Readdy, Newman, Bursch, Walz   The Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) was deployed on this mission. The attached Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS) booster was used for the first time to propel the communications technology spacecraft to geosynchronous transfer orbit. The second primary payload, the OERFEUS-SPAS, first in a series of ASTRO-SPAS astronomical missions, was also deployed. The joint German-U.S. astrophysics payload was controlled from the SPAS Payload Operations Control Center at Kennedy Space Center, the first time a Shuttle payload was managed from Florida. Two crew members also performed a space walk that lasted seven hours, five minutes, and 28 seconds. It was the last in a series of generic space walks begun earlier in the year.   STS-58   October 18-November 1, 1993   Columbia   Crew: Blaha, Searfoss, Seddon, McArthur, Wolf, Lucid, PS: Martin Fettman   STS-58 was the second dedicated Spacelab Life Sciences mission. Fourteen experiments were conducted in regulatory physiology, cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, and neuroscience. Eight of the experiments centered on the crew, six on 48 rodents carried on board. With the completion of her fourth space flight, Shannon Lucid accumulated the most flight time for a female astronaut on the Shuttle, 838 hours.   STS-61   December 2-13, 1993   Endeavour   Crew: Covey, Bowersox, Musgrave, Hoffman, Thornton, Akers, Nicollier   This Shuttle flight was one of the most challenging and complex missions every attempted. During a record five back-to-back space walks totaling 35 hours and 28 minutes, two teams of astronauts completed the first servicing of the Hubble Space Telescope. On the first space walk, which lasted seven hours and 54 minutes, the two-person team replaced two Rate Sensing Units, two Electronic Control Units, and eight electrical fuse plugs. On the second space walk, which lasted six hours and 35 minutes, two astronauts installed new solar arrays. On the third space walk, the Wide Field/Planetary Camera was replaced in about 40 minutes rather than in the four hours that had been anticipated. This team also installed two new magnetometers at the top of the telescope. On the fourth space walk, crew members removed and replaced the High-Speed Photometer with the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement unit. During this six-hour, 50-minute EVA, astronaut Akers set a new U.S. space-walking record of 29 hours, 14 minutes. The final space walk replaced the Solar Array Drive Electronics unit and installed the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph Redundancy kit and also two protective covers over the original magnetometers.   STS-60   February 3-11, 1994   Discovery   Crew: Bolden, Reightler, Chang-Diaz, Davis, Sega, Krikalev   This first Shuttle flight of 1994 marked the first flight of a Russian cosmonaut on the U.S. Space Shuttle­part of an international agreement on human space flight. The mission also was the second flight of the SPACEHAB pressurized module and marked the 100th Get Away Special payload to fly in space. Also on this mission, the Discovery carried the Wake Shield Facility to generate new semiconductor films for advanced electronics.   STS-62   March 4-18, 1994   Columbia   Crew: Casper, Allen, Gemar, Ivins, Thuot   The primary payloads were the U.S. Microgravity Payload-2 (USMP-2) and the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology-2 (OAST-2). USMP-2 included five experiments investigating materials processing and crystal growth in microgravity. OAST-2's six experiments focused on space technology and space flight. Both payloads were located in the payload bay, activated by crew members, and operated by teams on the ground.   STS-59   April 9-20, 1994   Endeavour   Crew: Gutierrez, Chilton, Godwin, Apt, Clifford, Jones   The Space Radar Laboratory-1 was the primary payload. It gathered data on the Earth and the effect of humans on its carbon, water, and energy cycles. It was located in the payload bay, activated by crew members, and operated by teams on the ground. The German Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency provided one instrument, the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR). This instrument imaged more than 400 sites and covered approximately 38.5 million miles of the Earth, equivalent to 20 percent of the planet.   STS-65   Columbia   July 8-23, 1994   Crew: Cabana, Halsell, Hieb, Thomas, Walz, Chiao, PS: Chiaki Naito-Mukai   STS-65 was the Columbia's last mission before its scheduled modification and refurbishment. This flight saw the first Japanese woman fly in space-payload specialist Chiaki Naito-Mukai. She also set the record for the longest flight to date by a female astronaut. The International Microgravity Laboratory-2 flew for the second time, carrying more than twice the number of experiments and facilities as on its first mission. Crew members split into two teams to perform around-the-clock research on the behavior of materials and life in near weightlessness. More than 80 experiments, representing more than 200 scientists from six space agencies, were located in the Spacelab module in the payload bay. This flight also marked the first time that liftoff and reentry were captured on videotape from the crew cabin. This flight was the longest Shuttle flight to date, lasting 14 days and 18 hours.   STS-64   September 9-20, 1994   Discovery   Crew: Richards, Hammond, Helms, Meade, Lee, Linenger   STS-64 marked the first flight of the Lidar In-Space Technology Experiment (LITE), which was used to perform atmospheric research. It also included the first untethered U.S. extravehicular activity (EVA) in 10 years. LITE involved the first use of lasers for environmental research. During the mission, the crew also released and retrieved the SPARTAN-201 using the remote manipulator system arm.   STS-68   September 30-October 11, 1994   Endeavour   Crew: Baker, Wilcutt, Jones, Bursch, Wisoff, Smith   This mission marked the second 1994 flight of the Space Radar Laboratory, part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. Flying the SRL in different seasons allowed investigators to compare observations between the two flights. The mission also tested the ability of SRL-2 imaging radar to distinguish between changes caused by human-induced phenomena such as oil spills and naturally occurring events. Five Get Away Specials were among the other cargo bay payloads. These included two by the U.S. Postal Service that held 500,000 commemorative stamps honoring the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11. STS-68 set another duration record, lasting more than 16-1/2 days.   STS-66   November 3-14, 1994   Atlantis   Crew: McMonagle, Brown, Ochoa, Tanner, Parazynski, Clervoy   STS-66 advanced data collection about the sun's energy output, chemical makeup of the Earth's middle atmosphere, and how these factors affect global ozone levels with the third flight of its Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ASTRO-3). The other primary payloads were CRISTA-SPAS, which continued the joint NASA-German Space Agency series of scientific missions, and the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet spectrometer. CRISTA-SPAS was released and retrieved using the remote manipulator system arm.   STS-63   February 3-11, 1995   Discovery   Crew: Wetherbee, Collins, Harris, Foale, Voss, Titov   This mission had special importance as a precursor and dress rehearsal for the series of missions that would rendezvous and dock with the Russian space station Mir. The orbiter Discovery approached within 12.2 meters of the Mir, then backed off to about 121.9 meters and performed a flyaround. The six-person crew included the second Russian cosmonaut to fly on the Space Shuttle. The mission also deployed the SPARTAN-204, a free-flying spacecraft that made astronomical observations in the far ultraviolet spectrum. The mission also included the third operation of the commercially developed SPACEHAB module, with its array of technological, biological, and other scientific experiments. Two crew members performed a space walk to test spacesuit modifications and demonstrate large-object handling techniques.   STS-67   March 2-18, 1995   Endeavour   Crew: Oswald, Gregory, Grunsfeld, Lawrence, Jernigan, PS: Ronald Parise, Samuel Durrance   The second Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ASTRO-2) flew on this mission. Its objectives were to obtain scientific data on astronomical objects in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. Its three telescopes made observations in complementary regions of the spectrum and gathered data that would add to scientists' understanding of the universe's history and the origins of stars. STS-67 set a new mission duration record of 16.6 days.   STS-71   June 27-July 7, 1995   Atlantis   Crew: Gibson, Precourt, Baker, Harbaugh, Dunbar   This flight marked the 100th U.S. human space flight and was the first of a series of flights that docked with the Russian space station Mir. On STS-71, the Atlantis and Mir remained docked for five days. The seven-person Shuttle crew included two Russian cosmonauts who remained on the Mir after the Atlantis returned to Earth. Two other cosmonauts and the U.S. astronaut Thagard, who had flown to Mir aboard the Russian Soyuz spacecraft in March 1995, returned to Earth in the Atlantis. The mission demonstrated the successful operation of the Russian-designed docking system, which was based on the concepts used in the Apollo-Soyuz test program flown in 1975.   STS-70   July 13-22, 1995   Discovery   Crew: Henricks, Kregel, Currie, Thomas, Weber   The deployment of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-7) marked the completion of NASA's TDRS system that provided communication, tracking, telemetry, data acquisition, and command services to the Shuttle and other low orbital spacecraft missions. STS-70 also marked the first flight of the new Block I Space Shuttle main engine. The engine featured improvements that increased the stability and safety of the main engines.   STS-69   September 7-18, 1995   Endeavour   Crew: Walker, Cockrell, Voss, Newman, Gernhardt   STS-69 deployed the Wake Shield Facility, which, flying separately from the Shuttle, produced an ""ultra vacuum"" in its wake and allowed experimentation in the production of advanced, thin film semiconductor materials. The SPARTAN spacecraft also was deployed and retrieved. The space walk on this mission was the 30th Shuttle extravehicular activity.   STS-73   October 20-November 5, 1995   Columbia   Crew: Bowersox, Rominger, Thornton, Coleman, Lopez-Alegria, PS: Fred Leslie, Albert Sacco   The second United States Microgravity Laboratory was the primary payload on STS-73. Some of the experiments on USML-2 resulted from the outcome of investigations on the first USML mission that flew aboard the Columbia on STS-50.   STS-74   November 12-20, 1995   Atlantis   Crew: Cameron, Halsell, Hadfield, Ross, McArthur   STS-74 was the second in a series of Mir linkups. The mission marked the first time that astronauts from the European Space Agency, Canada, Russia, and the United States were in space on the same complex at one time.   STS-72   January 11-20, 1996   Endeavour   Crew: Duffy, Jett, Chiao, Barry, Scott, Wakata   The crew of STS-72 captured and returned to Earth a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft, the Space Flyer Unit, which had been launched by Japan in March 1995. The mission also deployed and retrieved the OAST-Flyer spacecraft, the seventh in a series of missions aboard reusable free-flying SPARTAN carriers. The flight also included two space walks by three astronauts to test hardware and tools that will be used in the assembly of the Space Station.   STS-75   February 22-March 9, 1996   Columbia   Crew: Allen, Horowitz, Hoffman, Cheli, Nicollier, Chang-Diaz, PS: Umberto Guidoni   This mission was the 50th Shuttle flight since NASA's return to flight following the Challenger accident and the 75th Shuttle flight. Its mission was a reflight of the Tethered Satellite System (TSS). The tether broke three days into the mission.      STS-76   March 22-31, 1996   Atlantis   Crew: Chilton, Searfoss, Godwin, Sega, Clifford, Lucid   This mission featured the third docking between the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the Russian Space Station Mir. It included a space walk, logistics operations, and scientific research. More than 862 kilograms of equipment were transferred from the Atlantis to the Mir, including a gyrodyne, transformer, batteries, food, water, film, and clothing. Astronaut Shannon Lucid, the second U.S. astronaut and the first U.S. woman, began what would turn out to be a marathon stay on the Mir.   STS-77   May 19-29, 1996   Endeavour   Crew: Casper, Brown, Bursch, Runco, Garneau, Thomas   During this flight, the six-person Endeavour crew performed microgravity research aboard the commercially owned and operated SPACEHAB module. The crew also deployed and retrieved the Sparton-207/IAE (Inflatable Antenna Experiment) satellite. A suite of four technology experiments called the Technology Experiments for Advancing Mission in Space (TEAMS) also flew in the Shuttle's payload bay.   STS-78   June 20-July 7, 1996   Columbia   Crew: Henricks, Kregel, Helms, Linnehan, Brady, PS: J. Favier, R. Thirsk   The Life and Microgravity Spacelab (LMS) mission, building on previous Shuttle Spacelab flights dedicated to life sciences and microgravity investigations, studied the effects of long-duration space flight on human physiology and conducted the type of experiments that would fly on the Space Station. The length of this flight surpassed the longest Shuttle flight to date, lasting almost 17 days.   STS-79   September 16-26, 1996   Atlantis   Crew: Readdy, Wilcutt, Akers, Apt, Walz, Blaha, Lucid   On this mission, astronaut Shannon Lucid set the world's women's and U.S. record for length of time in space: 188 days and five hours. The mission was the fourth Shuttle docking with the Mir space station. Astronaut Lucid returned to Earth on the Atlantis and astronaut Blaha replaced her on the Mir.   STS-80   November 19-December 7, 1996   Crew: Cockrell, Rominger, Jernigan, Jones, Musgrave   STS-80 marked the third flight of the Wake Shield Facility that flew on STS-60 and STS-69 and the third flight of the German-built ORFEUS-SPAS II. Both the Wake Shield Facility and the ORFEUS-SPAS were deployed and retrieved during the mission, making it the first time that two satellites were flying freely at the same time. The record for the longest Shuttle flight was broken again, with this flight lasting slightly more than 17-1/2 days.   STS-81   January 12-22, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Baker, Jett, Wisoff, Grunsfeld, Ivins, Linenger, Blaha   This mission was the fifth of nine planned missions to Mir and the second involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut Linenger replaced astronaut Blaha aboard the Mir after spending 128 days in space. The Atlantis carried the SPACEHAB double module, which provided additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments.   STS-82   February 11-21, 1997   Discovery   Crew: Bowersox, Horowitz, Tanner, Hawley, Harbaugh, Lee, Smith   STS-82 was the second in a series of planned servicing missions to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The orbiter's robot arm captured the HST so it could be serviced. In five space walks, the crew replaced the Goddard High Resolution Spectrometer and the Faint Object Spectrograph with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer. Crew members also replaced other hardware with upgrades and spares. HST received a refurbished Fine Guidance Sensor and a refurbished spare Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) to replace one of four RWAs. A Solid State Recorder replaced one reel-to-reel tape recorder. The crew members also replaced the HST's insulation, which had deteriorated due to rapid heating and cooling as the telescope moved into and out of sunlight and also due to constant exposure to the molecular oxygen encountered in the upper reaches of the atmosphere.   STS-83   April 4-8, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Halsell, Still, Voss, Gernhardt, Thomas, PS: Roger Crouch, Greg Linteris   This mission lasted only four days and returned to Earth 12 days early due to a problem with one of the fuel cells that provided electricity and water to the orbiter. The Microgravity Science Laboratory-1 was rescheduled for a later mission.      STS-84   May 15-24, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Precourt, Collins, Clervoy, Noriega, Lu, Kondakova, Foale, Linenger   This was the sixth docking with the Mir space station and the third involving an exchange of U.S. astronauts. Astronaut Foale replaced astronaut Linenger, who had been in space for 132 days. The mission resupplied materials for experiments to be performed aboard the Mir and also returned experiment samples and data to Earth.   STS-94   July 1-17, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Halsell, Still, Voss, Gernhardt, Thomas, Crouch, Linteris   The reflight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1), which had flown on STS-83, took place on this mission. (STS-83 was cut short due to fuel cell problems.) The mission involved the same vehicle, crew, and experiment activities as planned on the earlier mission. MSL-1 focused on the phenomena associated with the routine influence of gravity, including the behavior of materials and liquids in a microgravity environment. The laboratory was a collection of 19 microgravity experiments housed inside a European Spacelab Long Module.      STS-85   August 7-19, 1997   Discovery   Crew: Brown, Rominger, Davis, Curbeam, Robinson, PS: Bjarni Tryggvason   The primary payload for STS-85 was the second flight of the CRISTA-SPAS-2. It was the fourth in a series of cooperative ventures between the German Space Agency and NASA. CRISTA-SPAS-2 was deployed and retrieved using the Discovery's robot arm. Two other instruments on board also studied the Earth's atmosphere: the Middle Atmosphere High Resolution Spectrograph Instrument (MAHRSI) measured hydroxyl and nitric oxide, while the Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM) carried state-of-the-art optical surfaces to study the impact of the atomic oxygen and the space environment on materials and services. The Technology Applications and Science (TAS-1), the Manipulator Flight Demonstration, supplied by Japan, and the international Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker were other mission payloads.   September 25-October 6, 1997   Atlantis   Crew: Wetherbee, Bloomfield, Parazynski, Titov, Chretien, Lawrence, Wolf, Foale   This was the seventh docking between the Atlantis and the Russian Mir space station and the fourth exchange of U.S. astronauts. The mission included a flyaround of the Mir to determine the location of the puncture on the hull of the Spektr module. The Mir crew pumped air into the Spektr module, and the Shuttle crew observed that the leak seemed to be located at the base of damaged solar panel. U.S. astronaut Foale returned aboard the Atlantis after a stay of 134 days on the Mir. His was the second longest single space flight in U.S. space flight history behind Shannon Lucid's 188-day flight in 1996. The Atlantis also carried the SPACEHAB double module to support the transfer of logistics and supplies for the Mir and the return of experiment hardware and specimens to Earth.      STS-87   November 19-December 5, 1997   Columbia   Crew: Kregel, Lindsey, Chawla, Scott, Doi, PS: Leonid Kadenyuk   Experiments that studied how the weightless environment of space affected various physical processes and two space walks highlighted STS-87. During this mission, payload specialist Kadenyuk became the first Ukranian to fly aboard the Space Shuttle. The mission was marked by an unexpected event when the attitude control system aboard the free-flying SPARTAN solar research satellite malfunctioned, causing the satellite to rotate outside the Shuttle. Crew members successfully recaptured the satellite and lowered it onto its berth in the payload bay. The capture took place during a space walk that lasted seven hours and 43 minutes. A second space walk that lasted seven hours and 33 minutes tested a crane that will be used in constructing the Space Station and a free-flying camera that will be able to monitor conditions outside the Space Station without requiring space walks.      STS-89   January 22-31, 1998   Endeavour   Crew: Wilcutt, Edwards, Reilly, Anderson, Dunbar, Sharipov, Thomas, Wolf   STS-89 featured the eighth Mir-Shuttle linkup and the fifth crew exchange. Astronaut Wolf, who had been on the Mir since September 1997, was replaced by astronaut Thomas.         Monographs in Aerospace History      Launius, Roger D., and Gillette, Aaron K. Compilers.

Feb                28, 2002                 Cold forecast delays shuttle                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- NASA postponed shuttle Columbia's launch by a day rather                than contend with cold weather this morning. The agency will try                again at 6:22 a.m. Friday. The weather then is forecast to be 49                degrees at launch time, with an 80 percent chance of acceptable                weather.                                 Temperatures were expected to approach the lower limit for liftoff                today at Kennedy Space Center, so shuttle managers announced the                delay after the six-man, one-woman crew went to sleep Wednesday                afternoon. The astronauts will spend today training for their mission                to the Hubble Space Telescope.                                 Freezing temperatures were implicated in the shuttle Challenger                disaster, although NASA's solid-rocket boosters have been redesigned                with heaters to alleviate much of that threat.                                 Seven astronauts, led by commander Scott Altman, will use the 11-day                mission to retrofit the orbiting telescope with a new camera, more                efficient solar array wings and a new power system.                                 Astronauts Duane ""Digger"" Carey, John Grunsfeld, Nancy Currie, Jim                Newman, Rick Linnehan and Mike Massimino will share duties ranging                from spacewalks to operating Columbia's robot arm to filming the                work.                                 The mission calls for five straight days of spacewalks, about 33                hours altogether.                                 With the launch delay, Columbia is to return to KSC at about 4:30                a.m. March 12.                                                     Feb                27, 2002                 Hubble awaits Columbia: Shuttle to carry                 repair team to telescope early Friday                 By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                                CAPE CANAVERAL -- NASA will dispatch a team of seven astronauts                Friday morning to polish its crown jewel of astronomy, the Hubble                Space Telescope.                                 The orbiting observatory has glimpsed galaxies on the edge of the                universe already, but a series of improvements during the mission                promise more clarity and more discoveries.                                 Veteran astronaut Scott Altman leads the crew with rookie pilot                Duane Carey. John Grunsfeld, Rick Linnehan, Jim Newman and Mike                Massimino will perform five straight days of spacewalks during the                11-day mission. Nancy Currie will maneuver the shuttle's robot arm                through several complex procedures.                                 Cold weather got the best of Columbia today. Shuttle managers decided                to delay the Thursday scheduled launch for one day to hold out for                better weather Friday. The new launch time is 6:22 a.m. The weather                forecast for Friday calls for an 80 percent chance of acceptable                weather, and temperatures at least 10 degrees warmer than Thursday.                                                Cold weather was a culprit in the 1986 Challenger disaster when                O-rings sealing the joints of the twin solid rocket boosters hardened,                allowing searing flames to leak out and destroy the external tank.                It was 36 degrees at liftoff that morning, but dropped well below                freezing the night before.                                 The boosters now carry heaters for the joints, so the concern lies                with ice building up on the external tank, NASA Test Director Pete                Nickolenko said. Officials fear ice chunks could ding Columbia's                vital heat shield tiles during liftoff.                                 The agency has never scrubbed a shuttle launch solely because of                cold weather, Priselac said.                                 Engineers also are analyzing a wheel bearing on Columbia, Shuttle                Program Manager Ron Dittemore said. They want to make sure the right                tests were performed on the bearings. There is a fear failed bearings                could cause the shuttle to skid at landing.                                 ""It tends to not roll very far after you lose the wheel bearing,""                Dittemore said.                                 The launch could be the easiest part of the mission for the crew                of seven, given the complexity of their job in space.                                 Upgrading the Hubble Space Telescope requires five spacewalks, a                perilous electrical shutdown of the observatory and hours of delicate                maneuvers with the robot arm.                                 NASA launched three previous repair and maintenance flights, but                a combination of intricate work and high risk make this mission                the most complex ever attempted, NASA officials said.                                 ""I used to think nothing would ever surpass the (first Hubble repair)                mission until I had an in-depth review of this mission,"" said Ed                Weiler, associate administrator for Space Science.                                 Astronauts will add several components to the telescope:                · A state-of-the-art camera 10 to 20 times more powerful than those                onboard.                · A smaller set of solar arrays that will provide 20 percent more                electricity.                · A control system that will direct electricity throughout the satellite.                                · A new guidance wheel to help point the mirror precisely.                 · A mechanical cooler to resurrect the telescope's infrared camera                that sees different light than other cameras.                                ""Looking at it as one big project, it's daunting,"" astronaut Jim                Newman said. ""We have to break it down into manageable pieces.""                                                While all of the new parts hold promise, the electrical control                system wrenches planners and astronauts with worry because it means                turning off the telescope completely for the first time in 11 years.                If it does not turn back on, astronomers will lose a scientific                instrument that made more discoveries than all its predecessors                combined.                                 ""It violates a long-standing rule in the space business that if                something's working well you don't turn it off and just hope it                comes back on,"" Weiler said. ""We fully anticipate that everything                will work, but it is something we've never done before.""                                 The electrical unit, which works much like a circuit breaker box                in a house, has deteriorated in space and cycles about 15 percent                less energy from the electricity-generating solar arrays to the                telescope's power-hungry instruments.                                 ""It wouldn't have to get much worse to threaten the ability to do                science,"" said Preston Burch, Hubble project manager.                                 Replacing it with a new model requires astronauts John Grunsfeld                and Rick Linnehan to work with specialized tools on the box and                wires that were never designed for such servicing. Most of the telescope's                other components were built into modules that can be replaced relatively                quickly and easily.                                 The replacement is scheduled for the third spacewalk of the mission.                                                ""We're going to be sitting on the edge of our seats,"" Burch said.                                                Hubble's success during the past 11 years is the main reason for                the worry.                                 The agency spent almost $7 billion on the orbiting telescope since                it was planned in the late 1970's. It costs $10 million a month                to operate, and every shuttle mission to service it runs at least                $500 million before considering the specialized equipment needed.                                                Burch said the gear for Thursday's flight alone cost $172 million.                                                Now seen as a bargain, the Hubble was considered a boondoggle during                most of its development thanks to technical problems and schedule                delays that kept it grounded seven years longer than planned. The                label seemed etched in stone when the telescope returned blurry                photographs of the cosmos due to a flawed main mirror.                                 Weiler said he felt like he was in the deepest hole in the desert,                and no one was eager to help him find the light.                                 ""We had a tough time digging out of that hole in Death Valley,""                he said.                                 Three years later, a group of astronauts fitted the telescope with                a set of glasses, and the telescope began living up to its promise.                                                Regular discoveries erased memories of flawed mirrors and led to                more than 3,200 technical papers.                                 During its 11 years looking out at space, the observatory has taken                420,000 photographs. Its highlights include:                 · Measuring the size of the universe and reliably estimating its                age.                 · Discovering black holes are common, and may exist at the center                of every galaxy.                 · Analyzing the atmosphere of a planet outside our solar system.                                · Discovering the universe is accelerating instead of slowing down.                                · Finding an enigmatic force called dark energy.                                 ""When people think of space exploration, they tend to think of men                on moon walking around exploring it,"" Grunsfeld said. ""Hubble is                about exploring the whole rest of the universe from the moon on                out.""                                 Friday's launch will mark the return of Columbia, the oldest of                NASA's four-shuttle fleet. The spacecraft, which first flew in April                1981, spent months in a Boeing hangar in California undergoing a                major overhaul and exhaustive inspections on miles of wiring.                                 Damaged wires caused a short circuit during Columbia's July 1999                liftoff.                                 The glitch shut down a computer controlling one of Columbia's three                main engines, nearly causing a catastrophe. A back-up computer took                over and the launch proceeded safely. The rest of the fleet was                grounded several months for wiring inspections on each orbiter in                1999.                                 While shuttles Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour returned to space                duty, Columbia spent extra time in the shop.                                 The work continued at Kennedy Space Center with more testing and                technicians adding the components needed to make the craft space-worthy                again.                                 ""The vehicle is in great shape and ready to fly,"" NASA Test Director                Steve Altemus said.                                                     Jan                31, 2002                 Crew faces challenges with Hubble                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- Working on one of the world's most sophisticated satellites                while wearing bulky gloves and a spacesuit will never be easy, one                of the spacewalkers preparing to service the Hubble Space Telescope                said Thursday.                                 ""It's designed to be serviced by astronauts, but there's always                surprises,"" said John Grunsfeld, one of four astronauts who will                take turns making five spacewalks to repair some of the telescope's                most sensitive components.                                 Some of the work, such as connecting a new power system, will be                akin to plugging a telephone into a wall jack while wearing boxing                gloves. They will also install a new camera inside the satellite,                recharge a defunct infrared device and replace a faulty reaction                wheel that helps point the$2 billion observatory.                                 Astronauts spent hundreds of hours practicing in a giant swimming                pool to simulate working in space, Grunsfeld said. He performed                two spacewalks during a December 1999 mission to service the space                telescope.                                 This will be the second flight aboard Columbia for mission commander                Scott ""Scooter"" Altman. It will be his third flight overall.                                 Rookie Duane ""Digger"" Carey will pilot Columbia during the first                mission of his career. Grunsfeld, Richard Linnehan, James Newman                and first-time flyer Michael Massimino will take turns performing                five demanding spacewalks.                                 ""I feel like the luckiest rookie astronaut since Alan Bean,"" Massimino                said. ""Al Bean got to walk on the moon on his first flight and I                get to spacewalk on the Hubble.""                                 Nancy Currie will operate the shuttle's robot arm during critical                maneuvers to place the telescope on its work platform in Columbia's                cargo bay.                                 At the launch pad, workers gave Columbia's cargo bay a final cleaning                before the specialized pallets and equipment to service the telescope                are placed inside.                                                     Jan                28, 2002                 Crawler inches Columbia to launch pad                By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                                CAPE CANAVERAL -- As shuttle Columbia made its trip to launch pad                39A on Monday, 30 people kept the massive crawler transporter running                with the goal of placing the $2 billion shuttle within an eighth                of an inch of the target area.                                 Wide as an interstate and as long as four tractor-trailers, each                of Kennedy Space Center's two 6-million pound crawlers combine the                low-tech brute force of a tracked vehicle with exquisite precision                to deliver the shuttles to their launch pads, all at less than 1                mph. Slowly, it pulverizes river rock to dust as it travels 31/2                and 5 miles to pad 39A and 39B.                                 These crawlers -- which once bore the massive Saturn 5 rockets of                the Apollo era -- still bear the weight of the nation's manned space                program. A problem with either or both of the crawlers literally                brings the program to a standstill, as it did last week.                                 ""There's only two, and without them you don't have a space program,""                Vickery said.                                 Ten United Space Alliance engineers took turns driving Columbia                out to the launch pad Monday for its Feb. 28 mission. Technicians                and spotters took their places around the machine, giving instructions                over walkie-talkies.                                 The move, called ""rollout"" in KSC parlance, was delayed several                days when the crawler's steering mechanism stuck. Columbia was supposed                to rollout last Wednesday. The delay will not set back the launch                date, NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.                                 An F-15 jet fighter buzzed through the clouds over the shuttle as                it inched down the custom-made crawlerway. NASA's Huey security                chopper flew laps close to the ground while an observation plane                circled the launch complex.                                 Crawler drivers can only see straight ahead and to the right because                the vehicle blocks the other side and back from view. It's like                seeing one tire while driving a car, and steering it solely by keeping                that tire near the curb. An advantage is the crawler moves less                than 1 mph.                                 ""You think of how many billions of dollars of hardware are on your                back and you get a little nervous,"" said Tom Chabrak, United Space                Alliance's lead engineer for the crawler transporters at KSC. ""If                you try not to have that as your major focus and just drive straight,                you won't even know you have a shuttle on top.""                                 Emerging from the Vehicle Assembly Building, Columbia, the external                fuel tank and pair of solid booster rockets resembled a tower bolted                to an office complex on top of a shopping center. Unlike those structures                typically built in place, this one moves.                                 Slowly.                                 It takes six hours to roll to the launch pad. An orbiting shuttle                makes three trips around the Earth in that amount of time.                                 ""You don't really have the wind blowing through your air at 9/10s                of a mile per hour,"" Vickery said.                                 Revving up the crawler and driving it as fast as, say, 2 mph is                out of the question.                                 ""We'd all love to crank it up a lot faster, but then it becomes                a danger aspect,"" Chabrak said. ""If you're up over 1 (mph) and then                one of these belts broke and you weren't able to get it stopped                in time you could really hurt somebody.""                                 The two driving cabs on each crawler are big enough for two people,                but are more reminiscent of a ship's bridge than a car. There's                a brake pedal and small red steering wheel and push-button gear                box -- forward, neutral and reverse. A dial substitutes for a gas                pedal.                                 The gray interior of the engine room, with its steel grate walkways                and two 2,750 horsepower diesel engines, also correspond to Navy                craft more than spacecraft. For example, the pumps that steer the                treads are the same used to turn battleship turrets.                                The engines turn electric generators sending a current to 16 motors                that turn the treads. A secondary generator provides power for lights,                computers and air-conditioners onboard.                                 ""We're basically a big electric vehicle,"" Chabrak said.                                 The diesel muffler beneath the machine is as long as some cars.                Chugging diesels and spinning generators make the engine room a                miniature purgatory of heat and noise when the machine is running.                Some corners of the interior reach 130 degrees, and produce 112                decibels of sound.                                 Workers are limited to 20 minutes at a time watching over the gauges                inside the compartment. Insulated from the heat and noise, technicians                sit in front of a bank of touch-screen computers monitoring the                crawler's health and keep the launch platform and shuttle level.                Hydraulic jacks raise one end of the crawler to keep the shuttle                steady as it climbs the 10-degree incline to the launch tower.                                There are only eight bolts holding the shuttle to the launch platform,                so controllers work to avoid any swaying or tilting.                                 As they approach the launch pad, drivers turn to a yellow screen                with crosshairs etched in it. A laser from the launch pad produces                digital crosshairs that drivers use to match with the permanent                marks. A perfect alignment leaves the shuttle bolted down for launch                while the crawler moves several miles away.                                 The process is identical to the one the crawlers used in the 1960's                moving Saturn 5 moon rockets to the same launch pads the shuttle                uses today. The launch pad and mobile launch platforms were modified                to handle the shuttles. The crawlers' evolution centered largely                on the control room, where modern computers replaced aging systems.                Mechanically, the gears, tread cleats and other parts are unchanged                from when the machines were constructed at KSC.                                 In fact, finding parts for the behemoth is the biggest challenge                to keeping them working. That problem was evident last week when                the crawler broke down and the second was not in condition to take                over.                                 Replacement parts have to be custom-made or the older parts must                be repaired to keep the massive machines operating.                                                     Jan                24, 2002                 Crawler delay strands Columbia at least two more days                 By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 The                space shuttle Columbia sits inside the Vehicle Assembly Building                at Kennedy Space Center on Thursday after the crawler, which transports                it to the launch pad, developed steering problems. The shuttle,                stacked to begin its mission, is stuck in the Vehicle Assembly Building                while mechanics try to repair the baseball infield-sized crawler                transporter that is supposed to carry Columbia to the launch pad                39A.                                 The spacecraft has been stranded inside the hangar since Wednesday.                NASA and United Space Alliance officials hope to move Columbia,                its external tank and booster rockets to the launch pad Saturday                morning, but may wait until Monday if the weather looks good, NASA                spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.                                 ""If Monday looks like it's going to be great, then they'll go Monday,                otherwise they'll go Saturday,"" he said.                                 The crawler developed steering problems that locked one of its tread                sets out of alignment. Mechanics worked on the machine but could                not replace a faulty bearing in time to move the shuttle Thursday.                They also are inspecting the vehicle's three other treadsets.                                 Maintenance work on the second crawler is keeping it from being                a replacement. ""It's unusual to have crawler problems of this magnitude                delaying the shuttle days in a row,"" Buckingham said. The rollout                delay will not set back Columbia's Feb. 28 launch date, Buckingham                said.                                 NASA and USA have six days in their preparation schedule to make                up for lost time. The crawlers, built on-site at Kennedy Space Center                in the mid-1960's, are the only vehicles large enough to lift a                launch-ready shuttle and its platform and carry the 12 million pounds                31/2 miles to an oceanside launch complex.                                 The move will be Columbia's first to the launch pad since July 1999,                when it lofted the Chandra X-ray telescope into space.                                This time, the orbiter's mission is to repair the Hubble Space Telescope.                                                     Jan                10, 2002                 Mission reset for Feb. 28                   By Steven Siceloff                  FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL -- NASA postponed shuttle Columbia's repair mission to                the Hubble Space Telescope by a week in an anticipated move Thursday,                officials said.                                 The agency's oldest orbiter will wait while engineers prepare a                new reaction wheel for the orbiting telescope, Kennedy Space Center                spokesman Jack King said. The device is one of four that carefully                points the $2 billion observatory at targets light years away.                                 A brief glitch with one of the wheels alarmed engineers in November                because it left the observatory without a reliable backup should                another wheel fail.                                 A sunrise launch is scheduled for 6:52 a.m. Feb. 28.                                 Managers hoped to launch Columbia on Feb. 21, but the spare wheel                would not have been ready. The instrument and its duplicate are                wrapping up tests before they will be trucked to Kennedy Space Center                and loaded into the orbiter.                                 Two spacewalkers are expected to take about an hour to remove the                questionable mechanism and install a new one. Other missions also                may wait.                                                      May                2, 2001                   Hubble Telescope to Receive More Upgrades                By Kelly Young                 FLORIDA TODAY                                 CAPE                CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Hubble Space Telescope has spent a little                more than 11 years in Earth's orbit. On paper, its life is more                than half over. But scientists say its best days are still ahead.                                                Astronomers at Tuesday's Space Congress were already gearing up                for another mission to upgrade Hubble. The flight of shuttle Columbia,                the orbiter's first mission since its own upgrade, is scheduled                to lift off no earlier than Nov. 19.                                 This telescope servicing mission, like the three that preceded it,                will add capability to the telescope and extend humanity's reach                into the universe.                                 ""It's actually a lot cheaper . . . than to put up new telescopes,""                said Steve Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute,                the research group that operates Hubble.                                 The astronauts will add a cooling system to a near-infrared camera                that lost its eyesight when it ran out of coolant. The new device,                which was tested during John Glenn's return flight in 1998, seeks                to restore that vision to look at the distant universe and areas                of the universe hidden by dust.                                 They also will attach a new instrument, called the Advanced Camera                for Surveys, which is projected to be 10 times more powerful than                the current camera for scanning the heavens.                                 Hubble's next targeted areas will include how galaxies formed in                the early universe and how they came to look the way they do.                                While abstract concepts such as ""dark matter"" and ""dark                energy"" intrigue scientists, it's matter as most humans know                it that captures public interest.                                 ""Because of the complexity of life that has arisen on Earth,                this tiny amount of matter holds a great deal of interest,""                Beckwith said.                                 The telescope's successor, the Next Generation Space Telescope is                expected to launch as early as 2007. One of its goals will be to                look for planets outside our solar system through eclipses.                                 Already, Hubble is able to tell when 1.5 percent of a star's light                is blocked out by a planet passing in front of it. So the future                telescope should provide an even clearer image of distant planetary                systems, Beckwith said.                                   March                26, 2001                 Final Crew Picked for Hubble Overhaul Mission posted                 FLORIDA TODAY                                 Three                astronauts have been named to complete the STS-109 crew already                in training for a mission that will feature five spacewalks to upgrade                the Hubble Space Telescope later this year. Shuttle astronauts will                install an advanced camera for surveys, a device to mechanically                cool science instruments and new high-power solar arrays.                                 Scott Altman, (Cmdr., USN), a two-time shuttle veteran, will command                the STS-109 mission. He will be joined on the flight deck by pilot                Duane Carey, (Lt. Col., USAF), making his first space flight, and                flight engineer Nancy Currie (Lt., USA, Ph.D.). Currie has three                previous space flights to her credit.                                 They join the previously assigned crew members -- payload commander                John Grunsfeld, James Newman, Richard Linnehan and Michael Massimino.                                                STS-109 will mark Altman's first flight as commander, having previously                flown as pilot on STS-90 in 1998 and STS-106 in 2000. Currie, who                brings extensive experience as a flight engineer and robotic arm                operator, flew on STS-57 in 1993, STS-70 in 1995 and STS-88 in 1998.                A space rookie, Carey was selected as an astronaut in 1996.                                 Grunsfeld has flown three times, STS-67 in 1995, STS-81 in 1997                and STS-103 in 1999 when he performed two spacewalks to service                the Hubble Space Telescope. Newman, veteran of three space flights,                STS-51 in 1993, STS-69 in 1995 and STS-88 in 1998, has conducted                four previous spacewalks. Linnehan flew on STS-78 in 1996 and STS-90                in 1998. Massimino is a member of the 1996 astronaut class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Glossary                 |  FAQ  |  Links                                                Talk to Us!                                                                                                                                  :::::: Contact:  webmaster@sm3b.gsfc.nasa.gov           | Global Science & Technology, Inc. ::::::                                       |          Page Last Updated:  April 23, 2002 |"

Before facing those postponements,       the third Hubble Space Shuttle servicing mission had been advanced       in the mission schedule. The servicing mission was originally scheduled       for June 2000, but when the third of Hubbles six gyroscopes failed,       the mission was split into two separate missions. The first mission,       STS-103, was scheduled for Oct. 14 with the second mission to follow       in 2001. (Hubble needs at least three of its six gyroscopes to be       functioning to enable the telescope to point precisely at distant       astronomical targets for scientific observation.)       In mid-August Shuttle managers decided       to extend wiring inspections and maintenance across the Shuttle       fleet after wiring problems were detected aboard Columbia. That       orbiter was inspected and determined to have wiring problems after       an irregularity occurred during the launch of STS-93 on July 23,       1999. Following inspections of Discovery, a new target launch date       of no earlier than Oct. 28 was announced (first launch delay).       Because of the amount of wiring repairs       needed, the planning date was shifted to no earlier than Nov. 19       (second delay). Shuttle managers decided to preserve the option       to launch either STS-103 or STS-99, the Space Radar Topography Mission,       first.       On Nov. 13, a fourth gyroscope on Hubble       failed and the observatory was put into safe mode, a state of       dormancy in which the telescope aims itself constantly at the sun       to provide electrical power to its systems.       As repairs to Discovery came to a close,       launch was targeted for Dec. 2. The launched date was put under       review after a half-inch-long drill bit was discovered to be lodged       in main engine No. 3. A new launch date of Dec. 6 was set (third       delay). Rollout to the pad proceeded and Discoverys main engine       No. 3 was replaced while the orbiter was on the pad.       After Discovery reached the pad, additional       damaged wiring, which was found in an umbilical between the orbiter       and the external tank, was detected and a new launch date of Dec.       9 was set to allow for repair and testing (fourth delay). The launch       was then reset to Dec. 11 (fifth delay). The new target date allowed       KSC workers to observe the Thanksgiving Holidays.       The mission was again put on hold after       a dented main propulsion system line which carries liquid hydrogen       fuel for the Shuttle main engines was found during closeout inspections       of Discovery's engine compartment. A new target date of no earlier       than December 16 was set (sixth delay).       By Dec. 13, workers at Launch Pad 39B       had completed inspections and leak checks on Shuttle Discovery's       replaced liquid hydrogen recirculation line that was replaced and       the target date confirmed to be Dec. 16.       On Tuesday, Dec. 14, 1999, the launch       countdown for STS-103 began on schedule at 1:30 a.m. Later that       day during routine inspections of the external tanks pressure lines,       a suspect weld was detected. To ensure that the proper welding materials       and procedures were used, a thorough review of process and paperwork       used during the fabrication of the lines was conducted. It was determined       that the same manufacturer performed welds on the 17-inch propellant       feed lines and struts in the AFT engine compartment when Discovery       was constructed. A 24 -hour delay was called to give the Shuttle       team time to review the manufacturing inspection records for those       lines as well. It was determine the welds were correctly made and       the launch was rescheduled to Dec. 17 (seventh delay).       On Dec.17, with an 80 percent chance       of unfavorable weather, external tank cyrogenic loading was started       at 11:29 a.m. EST. Tanking operations were complete at 3:00pm EST.       The launch countdown proceeded to the T-minus 9 minute mark and       held due to weather constraints. At 8:52pm EST the launch director       scrubbed the launch due to violations of weather launch commit criteria       and the launch was rescheduled to Dec. 18 (eighth delay).       Due to the prediction of poor weather       on Dec. 18, the mission management team decided to preserve a launch       option and rescheduled Discovery's launch from Dec. 18 to Dec. 19       at 7:50pm EST (ninth delay).       On Dec. 19, 1999, the weather outlook       was favorable, so Shuttle managers decided to proceed with the STS-103       launch countdown. The Shuttle launched on time at the beginning       of the 42 minute window.       To ensure that all flight and ground       systems were secured for the transition to Year 2000, the mission       was shortened from 10 days to 8 days.                             Landing       Information                             R unway 33, Kennedy Space Center,       Fla. Rollout distance 7,005 feet. Rollout time: 47 seconds. Mission       duration: 7 days, 23 hours, 10 minutes, 47 seconds. Landed on orbit       119, logging more than 3.267 million miles. It marked the 13th nighttime       landing in the shuttle program and the 8th at Kennedy Space Center.                                           Mission    Highlights                       S TS-103 restored the Hubble Space    Telescope to working order and upgraded some of its systems, allowing    the decade-old observatory to get ready to begin its second scheduled    decade of astronomical observations.       The first few days of the 8-day mission,    the crew prepared for the rendezvous and capture of the Hubble Space Telescope    and the three maintenance spacewalks to follow. After a 30-orbit chase.    Commander Brown and Kelly maneuvered the orbiter to a point directly beneath    Hubble, then moved upward toward it. Mission Specialist Clervoy grappled    Hubble using the orbiters robotic arm and placed it on the Flight Support    System in the rear of Discoverys cargo bay.       EVA No. 1: Mission Specialists Steven Smith    and John Grunsfeld conducted the missions first spacewalk. The two made    numerous repairs, including replacing the telescopes three Rate Sensor    Units  each containing two gyroscopes. They also installed six Voltage/Temperature    Improvement Kits between Hubbles solar panels and its six 10-year-old    batteries. The kits, the size of cell telephones, were designed to prevent    any overheating or overcharging of those batteries. A few minor objectives    were left undone, such as taking close-up photos of the Voltage/Temperature    Improvement Kits. The 8-hour, 15-minute space walk was second to the longest    space walk from Endeavour on STS-49 in May 1992. A few minor problems    Specialist helped account for the length of the space walk. The astronauts    had difficulty in removing one of the old RSUs, and opening valves and    removing caps on the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer.    The tasks were eventually completed.       EVA No. 2: During the missions second space    walk, Mission Specialists Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier installed    a new advanced computer  20 times faster than Hubbles old one  and    a new, 550-pound fine guidance sensor. This 8-hour, 10 minute space walk    was the third longest in history. With all major activities accomplished,    controllers reported that power was reaching both of the new pieces of    equipment. The brains of Hubble have been replaced, said Mission Specialist    Grunsfeld. About 30 minutes later, Hubble began thinking with those new    brains.       EVA No. 3: Smith and Grunsfeld again teamed    up to make the missions third and final space walk. Like the first two,    it also lasted more than 8 hours, making it the fourth longest in history.    The team installed a transmitter that sends scientific data from Hubble    to the ground. It replaced one that failed in 1998. The astronauts used    special tools developed for the task because transmitters, usually very    reliable, were not designed to be replaced in orbit. Smith and Grunsfeld    also installed a solid state digital recorder, replacing an older mechanical    reel-to-reel recorder.       Hubble was released from Discoverys cargo    bay on Christmas Day.       Mission STS-103 is the third time in the    U.S. Space Program that a crew has spent Christmas in space.

GX015-38-16269085	"40 EVA's and Counting                   STS-6 (April 4 to April 9, 1983)   Was the first on orbit demonstration of the newly developed space suit (EMU) for extravehicular activities (EVAs).  Astronauts Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson evaluated EMU mobility, management of the safety tethers, use of the portable foot restraint (PFR), and verified contingency procedures for the inertial upper stage (IUS) tilt table, which is used for satellite deployment.     STS-41B (February 3 to February 11, 1984)   Was the first on orbit demonstration of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).  During the second Shuttle EVA, the 10.2 psi cabin prebreathe protocol was used for the first time.  Astronauts Bruce McCandless and Robert Stewart evaluated the MMU, the mobile foot restraint (MFR) while mounted on the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), the Landsat refueling tool, and the hand-held EVA power tool.  The crew demonstrated the concept of docking to satellites with the trunnion pin attachment device (TPAD).  In addition, they retrieved a portable foot restraint (PFR) which had accidentally floated off.     STS-41C (April 6 to April 13, 1984)   Was the first time a Shuttle EVA was performed for commercial purposes.  During the EVA, astronauts James van Hoften and George Nelson rendezvoused with a rotating satellite using the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU).  It was the first on orbit repair of a satellite by EVA personnel.  During the repair, the astronauts replaced a failed Automatic Control System module (this task was designed for EVA servicing) and repaired the coronagraph/ polarimeter of the satellite (was not designed for EVA servicing).     STS-41G (October 5 to October 13, 1984)   Was the first EVA performed by an American woman, Kathryn Sullivan.  The EVA crew demonstrated that orbital refueling of Landsat type satellites is possible.  Also, the astronauts repositioned a Ku-band antenna that was unresponsive to movement commands for stowage.     STS-51A (November 8 to November 16, 1984)   Astronauts Joseph Allen and Dale Gardner, wearing Manned Maneuvering Units (MMU), retrieved the malfunctioning satellites WESTAR and PALAPA, both deployed on Mission STS-41B. To capture the satellites, the astronauts used an engine nozzle docking tool called ""the stinger.""      STS-51D (April 12 to April 19, 1985)   The first unscheduled EVA was performed after the SYNCOM-3 satellite booster failed to fire after deployment.  Astronauts David Griggs and Jeffrey Hoffman attached a ""flyswatter"" device to the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) end effector, which was used to hook a timing lever on the satellite.  Although this effort was unsuccessful, the readiness of the EMU hardware and of the nominally trained EVA crew was demonstrated.     STS-51I (August 27 to September 3, 1985)   Astronauts William Fisher and James van Hoften performed two extravehicular activities (EVAs) to capture, repair and redeploy the SYNCOM-3 satellite deployed during the STS-51D mission.  This was the first time that EVA crewmembers manually captured, handled and deployed a 6800 kg (15,000 lb.) satellite.       STS-61B (November 26 to December 3, 1985)   Two EVA based experiments were conducted to test the assembly of erectable structures in space: Experimental Assembly of Structures in Extravehicular Activity (EASE) and Assembly Concept for Construction of Erectable Space Structure (ACCESS).  During the first spacewalk, astronauts Sherwood Spring and Jerry Ross erected the tetrahedron EASE structure using an ""assemble as you go"" method of construction -- the crew worked at the end of the structure to further erect the assembly.  During the second EVA, which evaluated the ACCESS experiment, the structure was moved out from the payload bay, while the crewmembers remained at their ""workstation"" inside the payload bay.     STS-37 (April 5 to April 11, 1991)   Jerry Ross and Jay Apt performed the first unscheduled EVA since April 1985, during which they freed and manually deployed the antenna of the Gamma Ray Observatory satellite.  The following day, the two astronauts performed the first scheduled spacewalk since November 1985 to test means for astronauts to move themselves and equipment around.  These procedures were verified to plan future operations for maintenance and resupply of the International Space Station as accurate as possible.     STS-49 (May 7 to May 19, 1992)   First U.S. orbital flight to feature four extravehicular activities (EVAs), one of which was the first spacewalk to involve three crewmembers working simultaneously outside the Space Shuttle.  The crew successfully captured and redeployed INTELSAT VI, which was launched onboard a Titan rocket in March 1990.  During the first and second EVA's, astronaut Pierre Thout tried to attach the capture bar onto the satellite while positioned on the end of the RMS arm.  However, both attempts failed.  During the third EVA, performed by astronauts Thout, Richard Hieb, and Tom Akers, the satellite was successfully captured and placed atop the perigee kick motor, which allowed successful deploy the next day.  The fourth EVA was performed by astronauts Akers and Kathryn Thornton to verify maintenance and assembly capabilities for the International Space Station.     STS-54 (January 13 to January 19, 1993)   Astronauts Mario Runco and Greg Harbough performed a series of extravehicular tasks designed to increase knowledge about working in space; the astronauts tested their abilities to move about freely in the Shuttle's payload bay, climbed into foot restraints without using hands, and simulated how to carry large objects.     STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993)   The EVA scheduled on STS-57 was the second generic EVA performed to test and verify general extravehicular procedures.  In the beginning of their EVA, astronauts Jeff Wisoff and David Low manually stowed the antenna of the EURECA spacecarrier.  This operation was normally accomplished by the automatic antenna retractors, which had malfunctioned.     STS-51 (September 12 to September 22, 1993)   Jim Newman and Carl Walz performed the last generic spacewalks of the series.  The two astronauts evaluated the tools, tethers and foot restraint platform intended to be used during the upcoming Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission (STS-61).     STS-61 (December 2 to December 13, 1993)   During the STS-61 mission, four crewmembers performed five back-to-back spacewalks to repair and maintain the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).  During the first EVA, astronauts Story Musgrave and Jeff Hoffman replaced two Rate Sensing Units (RSUs) (gyroscopes) and the Electronic Control Units which direct the RSUs.  The second EVA was performed by astronauts Kathryn Thornton and Tom Akers, during which they jettisoned two solar arrays.  The third EVA, performed by Musgrave/ Hoffman was dedicated to replace one of Hubble's five scientific instruments, the Wide Field/Planetary Camera.  The new unit is able to compensate for the flaw in the primary mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope.  During the fourth EVA (Thornton/Akers) the High-Speed Photometer was removed and replaced by the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit.  The COSTAR redirects light to three of four remaining Hubble instruments and compensates for the flaw in the main mirror for those instruments.  Also, a co-processor was installed to enhance the performance of the HST computer.  During the last EVA, new solar arrays and directing electronics were implemented and the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph redundancy (GHRS) kit was installed.     STS-64 (September 9 to September 20, 1994)   Mission Specialists Mark Lee and Carl Meade performed the 28th EVA of the Space Shuttle program.  During the first untethered spacewalk in ten years, the crewmembers tested a new backpack called Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER), a device designed to rescue crewmembers which became accidentally untethered.     STS-63 (February 2 to February 11, 1995)   Bernard Harris became the first African-American to perform an extravehicular activity.  Together with his colleague Michael Foale, he tested the isolation of the space suit during extreme cold conditions.  This EVA resulted in several modifications of the EMU to improve heat development during dark passes.      STS-69 (September 7 to September 18, 1995)   The 30th EVA performed was dedicated to test techniques that will be used during the construction and assembly of the International Space Station.  Astronauts Jim Voss and Mike Gernhardt verified several preselected techniques.     STS-72 (January 11 to January 20, 1996)   During two EVA's, astronauts Leroy Chiao, Winston Scott and Daniel Barry evaluated the Portable Work Platform (PWP), tested a rigid umbilical cord which will be used during International Space Station construction, and evaluated other ISS assembly hardware and tools.     STS-76 (March 22 to March 31, 1996)   The first U.S. spacewalk outside the Russian Space Station Mir was performed by Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford.  While the Space Shuttle was docked with the Mir, Godwin and Clifford attached the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) on the exterior of Mir's docking module.  The MEEP was designed to study the effets of exposure to the space envrionment on a variety of materials.     STS-80 (November 19 to December 7, 1996)   Two spacewalks were canceled because the hatch of the airlock failed to open.  After return to Earth, engineers located a loose screw as the reason for the malfunction.     STS-82 (February 11 to February 21, 1997)   Five spacewalks were performed by 4 crewmembers during the second Hubble Space Telescope Reservicing mission (HST-2).  Joe Tanner, Greg Harbough, Mark Lee and Steve Smith upgraded several engineering gears and implemented two new science instruments, the Near Infrared Camera (NICMOS) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS).      STS-86 (September 25 to October 6, 1997)   During the docked phase of the Space Shuttle with the Russian Space Station Mir, Scott Parazynski and Vladimir Titov removed the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (MEEP) deployed during the STS-76 mission from the Mir docking adapter.  They also tested the SAFER hardware and verified compatible equipment that will be used during the assembly of Russian and American components of the International Space Station.  Titov became the first non-American to perform a Shuttle-EVA, which was also the third U.S.-Russian joint EVA.     STS-87 (November 19 to December 5, 1997)   Takao Doi became the first Japanese to spacewalk.  Together with astronaut Winston Scott he tested tools and techniques for the assembly of the International Space Station, such as the AERCAM/SPRINT free-flying TV system.  In the beginning of their spacewalk they manually captured the Spartan satellite.  This task shortened the available EVA time for ISS testing purposes, so a second spacewalk was conducted later during the mission.

GX104-69-14384964	"NOAA     Magazine  ||  NOAA Home Page             NOAA SATELLITES HELP SAVE SIX FISHERMEN FROM ATLANTIC OCEAN        January 10, 2002 — Six fishermen     were rescued from the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles off the coast of     North Carolina recently, thanks to environmental satellites in     the international  Search     and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking Program , Cospas-Sarsat.      (Click NOAA image for larger view of emergency position-indicating     radio beacon, or EPIRB.)        Satellites      operated by  NOAA  and by the     Russian government detected a distress signal from the 53-foot     fishing vessel Mediterranean Sea II Jan. 6. The crew was airlifted     by Coast Guard Search and Rescue teams.         The vessel, 50 miles southeast     of Cape Fear, had electrical and engine room fires, and was without     electricity and engine power in rough seas. A large wave hit     the bow of the ship and destroyed the windscreen on the bridge.     The vessel was taking on water.        The crew manually activated     their 406 MHz emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB)     after deploying their on-board pumps to control the flooding     on the vessel. The signal from the emergency beacon was detected     by the Cospas-Sarsat system, and NOAA notified the Coast Guard.        ""While the cause of the     incident is not yet known, six lives were saved by the use of     properly working safety gear such as an EPIRB and life jackets.     With the EPIRB, we were able to quickly find their location and     in this case able to save their lives,"" said LCDR Brendan     McPherson, public affairs officer for the Coast Guard Atlantic     Area Command, headquartered in Portsmouth, Va.         When the Coast Guard received     the distress alert from NOAA, a search was started with air crews     from Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City, N.C., in an HH-60     Jayhawk helicopter, a C-130 Hercules aircraft and an HH-65 Dolphin     helicopter from Coast Guard Air Facility Charleston, S.C.         The first helicopter on scene     was the rescue helicopter from Air Facility Charleston finding     the Mediterranean Sea II almost completely submerged and some     fishermen jumping into the water. All of the fishermen were wearing     survival suits and Personal Flotation Devices. Three fishermen     were hoisted aboard the helicopter and taken to safety.         The helicopter from Air Station     Elizabeth City arrived shortly and hoisted the three remaining     fishermen to safety from 10-15 foot seas, sustained winds of     25 mph, and gusts nearing 50 mph. The fishermen were taken to     North Myrtle Beach Grand Strand Airport, N.C., in good condition.             The crew of the Mediterranean     Sea II, homeported in Little River, S.C., said they are thankful     their emergency beacon saved the day. In an emergency, the equipment     can mean the difference between life and death.         The Cospas-Sarsat system uses     a constellation of satellites in geostationary and polar orbits     to detect and locate emergency beacons on vessels and aircraft     in distress. NOAA's Satellite and Data Service represents the     United States in this program, providing satellite platforms     and ground equipment, and operating the U.S. Mission Control     Center.         NOAA's Geostationary Operational     Environmental Satellites ( GOES )     can instantly detect emergency signals. The polar-orbiting satellites     in the system detect emergency signals as they circle the Earth     from pole to pole. Emergency signals are sent to the U.S. Mission     Control Center at NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data,     and Information Service in Suitland, Md., then automatically     sent to rescue forces around the world. Today there are 30 countries     participating in the system. More than 12,000 lives have been     saved worldwide since the system became operational in 1982.        NOAA's     National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service  is the nation's primary source of     space-based meteorological and climate data. NOAA Satellite and     Data Service operates the nation's environmental satellites,     which are used for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and     other environmental applications such as fire detection, ozone     monitoring, and sea surface temperature measurements. NOAA Satellite     and Data Service also operates three data centers, which house     global data bases in climatology, oceanography, solid earth geophysics,     marine geology and geophysics, solar-terrestrial physics, and     paleoclimatology.

If your flight is canceled, most         airlines will rebook you on their first available flight to your destination,         at no additional charge. If you are able to find a flight on another airline,         ask the first airline to endorse your ticket to the new carrier. This         could save you a fare increase but there is no rule requiring them to         do this.          Each airline has its own policies         about what it will do for delayed passengers; there are no federal requirements.         If you are delayed, ask the airline if they will pay for meals or a phone         call. Contrary to what many people believe, airlines are not required         to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed or canceled.            Overbooked Flights          Overbooking is not illegal,         and most airlines overbook their scheduled flights to a certain extent         in order to compensate for “no-shows.” Passengers are sometimes         left behind or “bumped” as a result. When seats are oversold,         the U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to ask people         to give up their seats voluntarily, in exchange for compensation. Airlines         set guidelines for what to offer passengers – money, a free trip,         food, or lodging.           Federal rules protect you         if you have been bumped against your will on most domestic flights or         outbound international flights. The airline must give you a statement         describing your rights. If the airline is not able to get you to your         final destination within one hour of your original scheduled arrival time,         you are entitled to an on-the-spot payment as compensation. The amount         depends on the price of the ticket and the length of the delay. An airline         may offer you free transportation on a future flight in place of a check         for denied boarding compensation, but you have the right to insist on         a check.          However, to be eligible for         compensation, you must have a confirmed reservation – an “OK”         in the status box of your ticket. You must also meet the airline’s         deadlines for ticketing and check-in.            Delayed or Damaged         Bags           If your bags don’t come         off the conveyor belt, report this to the airline before you leave the         airport. Insist that they fill out a form and give you a copy, even if         they say the bag will be in on the next flight. Also make sure you know:          • the name of the person         who filled out the form;          • a phone number for         follow up.          Confirm that the airline will         deliver the bag to you without charge when it is found; ask them about         this as well.           Some airlines will give you         money to purchase a few necessities. If they don’t provide you with         cash, ask what types of articles would be reimbursable, and keep all receipts.          If a suitcase arrives damaged         – the airline will usually pay for repairs. If an item can’t         be fixed, they will negotiate a settlement to pay you its depreciated         value. The same holds true for belongings packed inside. Of course, airlines         may decline to pay for damage caused by the fragile nature of the broken         item or inadequate packing, rather than the airline’s handling.                    Lost Bags          If your bag is declared officially         lost, you will have to submit a second, more detailed form within a set         time period established by the airline. The information you submit is         used to estimate the value of your lost belongings. Airlines consider         the depreciated value of your possessions, not their original price or         the replacement costs. They can invoke a ceiling of $1250 per passenger         on the amount of money they’ll pay. When your luggage and its contents         are worth more than that, you may want to purchase “excess valuation,”         if available, from the airline when you check in. The airline may refuse         to sell excess valuation on some items that are especially valuable or         breakable, such as antiques, musical instruments, jewelry, manuscripts,         negotiable securities and cash. On international trips, the airline’s         liability limit is $9.07 per pound.           Keep in mind that these limits are maximums. If the depreciated value         of your property is worth less than the liability limit, the airline will         offer this lower amount. If the airline’s settlement doesn’t         fully cover your loss, check your homeowner’s or renter’s         insurance to see if it covers losses away from home. Some credit card         companies and travel agencies offer optional or even automatic supplemental         baggage coverage.                                                                                    This service is       provided by the Federal Citizen Information Center of the        U.S. General Services Administration . If you       have a comment or question, e-mail

Launch originally targeted for Feb. 13 moved up to Feb.                   11 to provide more range opportunities. Countdown proceeded                   smoothly to on-time liftoff Feb. 11. First flight of Discovery                   after Orbiter Maintenance Down Period (OMDP).

Rollout distance: 7,066 feet (2,154 meters) Rollout time:                   one minute, zero seconds. Mission duration: nine days, 23                   hours, 37 minutes, nine seconds. Landed on revolution 150.                   Landed on second opportunity after first waved off due to low                   clouds. Ninth night landing in Shuttle program history and                   fourth at KSC.                                                                                                                                                                                              Mission             Highlights                                                STS-82             demonstrated anew the capability of the Space Shuttle to service             orbiting spacecraft as well as the benefits of human spaceflight.             Six-member crew completed servicing and upgrading of the Hubble             Space Telescope during four planned extravehicular activities (EVAs)             and then performed a fifth unscheduled space walk to repair             insulation on the telescope.               HST             deployed in April 1990 during STS-31. It was designed to undergo             periodic servicing and upgrading over its 15-year lifespan, with             first servicing performed during STS-61 in December 1993. Hawley,             who originally deployed the telescope, operated the orbiter Remote             Manipulator System arm on STS-82 to retrieve HST for second             servicing at 3:34 a.m. EST, Feb. 13, and positioned it in payload             bay less than half an hour later.               Relying             on more than 150 tools and crew aids, Lee and Smith performed EVAs             1, 3 and 5, and Harbaugh and Tanner did EVAs 2 and 4. EVA 1 began at             11:34 p.m. EST, Feb. 13, and lasted six hours, 42 minutes. One of             Hubble's solar arrays was unexpectedly disturbed by gust of air from             Discovery's airlock when it was depressurized, but was not damaged.             Lee and Smith removed two scientific instruments from Hubble, the             Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) and Faint Object             Spectrograph (FOS), and replaced them with the Space Telescope             Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and Near Infrared Camera and             Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), respectively. STIS expected to             shed further light on supermassive black holes. NICMOS features more             capable infrared detectors and will give astronomers their first             clear view of the universe at near infrared wavelengths between 0.8             and 2.5 micrometers.               EVA             2 began at 10:25 p.m., Feb. 14, and lasted seven hours, 27 minutes.             Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a degraded Fine Guidance Sensor and a             failed Engineering and Science Tape Recorder with new spares. Also             installed a new unit called the Optical Control Electronics             Enhancement Kit, which will further increase the capability of the             Fine Guidance Sensor. During this EVA astronauts noted cracking and             wear on thermal insulation on side of telescope facing sun and in             the direction of travel.               EVA             3 began at 9:53 p.m., Feb. 15, and lasted seven hours, 11 minutes.             Lee and Smith removed and replaced a Data Interface Unit on Hubble,             as well as an old reel-to-reel- style Engineering and Science Tape             Recorder with a new digital Solid State Recorder (SSR) that will             allow simultaneous recording and playback of data. Also changed out             one of four Reaction Wheel Assembly units that use spin momentum to             move telescope toward a target and maintain it in a stable position.             After this EVA, mission managers decided to add EVA 5 to repair the             thermal insulation on HST.               EVA             4 began at 10:45 p.m., Feb. 16, and lasted six hours, 34 minutes.             Harbaugh and Tanner replaced a Solar Array Drive Electronics package             which controls the positioning of Hubble's solar arrays. Also             replaced covers over Hubble's magnetometers and placed thermal             blankets of multi-layer material over two areas of degraded             insulation around the light shield portion of the telescope just             below the top of the observatory. Meanwhile, inside Discovery             Horowitz and Lee worked on the middeck to fabricate new insulation             blankets for HST.               Final             space walk, EVA 5, lasted five hours, 17 minutes. Lee and Smith             attached several thermal insulation blankets to three equipment             compartments at the top of the Support Systems Module section of the             telescope which contain key data processing, electronics and             scientific instrument telemetry packages. STS-82 EVA total of 33             hours, 11 minutes is about two hours shy of total EVA time recorded             on first servicing mission.               Discovery's             maneuvering jets fired several times during mission to reboost             telescope's orbit by eight nautical miles. Hubble redeployed on Feb.             19 at 1:41 a.m. and is now operating at the highest altitude it has             ever flown, a 335- by 321-nautical-mile orbit. Initial checkout of             new instruments and equipment during mission showed all were             performing nominally. Calibration of two new science instruments was             to take place over a period of several weeks with first images and             data anticipated in about eight to 10 weeks. Two more servicing             missions planned for 1999 and 2002.               Performance             of Discovery was nominal throughout the mission.
