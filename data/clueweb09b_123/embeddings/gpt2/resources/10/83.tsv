How Real is 20th      Century Warming?         Surface Temperatures           In  Figure        2  we see a record of surface temperature anomalies with respect to        a 30-year period, 1961-1990. Anomalies, being relative to each ""thermometer's""        individual average are perhaps the most accurate way of combining observations        from the wide array of temperature measurements around the world for the        past hundred years or so since instrumental observation began. The record        shows a rise in global surface temperatures of nearly 1.0°C (~ 1.8°F)        since 1920. But this rise has been neither smooth nor monotonic. It can        be broken into roughly five pieces (the large warming in 1998 is unprecedented        and will be discussed separately):                             Figure 2. Measured global surface        temperatures relative to the average for the 30-year period 1961 to 1990        (the horizontal line)                                                              1860-1920  relatively        constant         1920-1940  rapid rise         1940-1975  slight decline (at least in the northern hemisphere)        1975-1982  rapid rise        1982-1997  slow rise complicated by cooling from two volcanoes         But the single year        numbers for the entire Earth do not tell the complete story as they are        averages of a rich variation in regional temperatures. In  Figure        3   we see the difference in temperatures between averages 1955-1974        and 1975-1994. Especially prominent is the cooling in parts of the oceans        and warming in the high-latitude land masses. In addition, it has been found        that much of the warming results not from increases in daytime temperatures        but from lack of decreases at night. Thus, whatever the climate is doing,        the Earth seems to be having difficulty radiating away its heat at night.        Finally, the warming seen so far in 1998 has a regional character ( Figure        4 ) significantly different. It shows warming relative to the period        1992-1998 that includes most land masses (Europe is cooler due to a change        in North Atlantic atmospheric conditions called the North Atlantic Oscillation),        and most of the oceans (cooler region in equatorial Pacific is strong La        Niña signature). Thus the magnitude and extent of the 1998 warming        is cause for considerable attention.                                           Figure 3. Change (from 1955-74 to        1975-94) of annual land-surface air temperature and sea surface temperature                                                                                         Figure 4.

Reynolds NCEP/NWS/NOAA                                                                            In his book        Fred Singer attacks the validity of records like  Figure        2  by suggesting        the so-called ""urban heat island effect."" There is always the concern that        part of the observed warming is an instrumental effect of the observational        sites being engulfed by our expanding cities that at times are warmer than        the surrounding countryside. In his Figure 7 he shows observations made        in California showing this effect. The intent here is to suggest that there        is little or no warming which is a remarkable reading of the data. In truth        many painstaking studies have been done to determine how great this effect        might be on a global scale. All major studies show it to be quite small.                  Figure        5  is the latest        result from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) which employed satellite        surveys to separate observational sites into urban, suburban, and rural.        The results are curious in that they show an insignificant difference until        1992 (during the rapid cooling caused by aerosols injected into the stratospheric        by the Mt. Pinatubo eruptions). This result is corroborated by satellite        observations of temperature which, of course, are not affected by the effect        in question (see discussion of satellite temperatures below).                      Figure 5. Global surface temperatures separated into three categories, those in rural, suburban, and urban areas. (NCDC unpublished graph)                        Singer goes on to guide        the reader to the wrong conclusion by showing an earlier NCDC result for        the United States (his Figure 8). The temperatures in this graph (after        correction for urban effects) actual decline from 1940 to 1985. What Singer        does not show is that record is virtually indistinguishable from the one        without the correction! In fact the US temperatures for this period do not        follow global ones as is true for Europe (also shown in his Figure 8). This        is more a result of American and European proximity to and dependence upon        the North Atlantic which was cooling during that period. Reference to my         Figure 3  shows that this situation has changed        in the last 20 years.         Satellite Temperatures           Since 1979, surface        measurements have been augmented by observations from satellites. A series        of 9 successive but overlapping platforms have been taking the Earth’s        temperature via variations in the microwave radiation from atmospheric oxygen—the        so-called Microwave Sounding Units, MSU. Looking down in two different frequency        bands, which sense the stratosphere (MSU 4, roughly 12-27 km) and the upper        troposphere (MSU 2, roughly 0-12 km), respectively, these satellites have        given us the first truly global assessment of temperatures, albeit high        in the Earth’s atmosphere. In an attempt to record temperatures more        characteristic of the lower atmosphere (MSU 2R, roughly 0-7 km), the MSU        2 detector is tilted to look towards the horizon at several angles, which        allows subtraction of the upper troposphere contribution. Thus, we have        global temperature records from three altitudes in our atmosphere. The record        of most interest because it most nearly approximates temperatures at the        surface is MSU 2R (characteristic of the lower atmosphere) shown in  Figure        6 . This can be compared with the surface record shown in  Figure        7  for both land and ocean (note tick marks indicating the start of        satellite observations as well as times of cooling due to eruptions of volcanoes,        El Chichon and Pinatubo). The two major coolings in the satellite record        (largely due to the volcanic eruptions already mentioned), and the remarkable        temperature increase in 1998 are clearly seen. Satellite records are roughly        substantiated by balloon measurements (called radiosondes). The three records—surface,        balloon, and satellite—are compared in  Figure        8 . There is good agreement among these with the exceptions of a short        time around 1980 when surface temperatures in the tropics were cooler than        the others, and since 1992 after the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. Of course at        any given time there is no reason why temperatures in the lower troposphere        should agree exactly with those near the surface within the so-called planetary        boundary layer (for instance the satellite missed much of the warming due        to the 1996-97 El Niño). But on the larger global-scale average over        several years one would expect fairly close agreement that is seen.              Singer’s        book documents a controversy raised by the so-called ""Contrarians"" who dispute        global warming. In attempting to determine whether the atmosphere was warming        or cooling during the time of the satellite record (1979-1997), a straight        line was drawn through it. Since the satellites observed slightly higher        temperatures around the beginning and slightly cooler at the end, the slope        of the line is unduly dominated by these end points and shows a slight cooling.        The surface record shows only moderate warming (moderated as it was by two        volcanic coolings). Thus, while agreement between the two records is largely        very good, the small and largely artificial difference in trends shows one        cooling and one warming. Much has been made in the ""Contrarian"" press of        this. This is the essence of Singers’ figures 6 and 9 complete with straight lines included. In addition,      Figure 6 shows not general agreement between surface and satellite, but a growing difference.      Compare this result with that ( (Figure 9)   published in the referred literature and substantiated          Figure 6. Satellite observations (MSU-2R)(monthly global temperature changes for the lower             troposphere) (surface to 8 km height)                                                 Figure 7.

Dashed line (inset) is MSU 4 minus radiosonde. (Note: MSU 2R and MSU 4 are channels of the MSU instrument designed to sample the lower troposphere and stratosphere, respectively.                            by John Christy (private communication), who is in charge of the satellite        temperature program for NASA. This shows the difference between the satellite's        MSU 2R record and the surface for the entire Earth, northern subtropics,        tropics, and southern subtropics. Note that the small disagreement around        1980 is confined to the tropics, and that the disagreement during Mt. Pinatubo        cooling and recovery is global. The rest of the record is essential agreement.        I am not certain where Singer got his data for Figure 6, but I believe it        to be incorrect.  Figure 9  shows that a better way to determine temperature        trends during this period would be to draw a straight line through the record        from 1981 to 1992 and discuss the end points separately. Done this way Singer’s        Figure 6 is misleading and unfortunate. His Figure 9 goes on to show latitudinal        variations in that straight line trend which continues to mislead; however,        it does show an interesting agreement for the north latitudes where most        of the continents are. We will discuss this later since far from contradiction        warming expectations, it actually supports them.                Finally, there        has been much in the referred literature about the difficulties of determining        satellite temperatures and trends when the record is a patchwork quilt from        9 different platforms which had to be cross calibrated and all of which        were plagued by orbital decay and drifts. Christy himself has continually        published adjustments to this record that changed the straight line trend.        It is instructive to look at the history of these changes which is shown        in  Figure 10 . At first the trend trended to        increase cooling due partly to the disagreement between satellite and surface        in the amount of recovery from Pinatubo cooling. This was followed by adjustments        that culminated in a trend indistinguishable from zero with the inclusion        of orbit decay and drift corrections. The final point given me by Christy        (private communication) incorporates the massive warming of 1998.                 My reading of attempts to compare surface and satellite temperatures  is that we are finding general corroboration of the surface record, albeit with some fascinating differences, which may lead to better understanding of coupling between the surface and planetary boundary layer on the one hand and the lower troposphere on the other. But perhaps most important, the general agreement of satellite with surface represents  extremely strong support for the conclusion that there the global urban heat island effect is negligible.                  Summary to Question: is 20th Century Temperature Record Real?        Thus, while continued careful study is necessary, the general agreement between surface instruments, balloon-borne and satellite detectors, leaves little doubt that the warming in the 20th century is real and is approaching 1°C and that the arguments put forth in Singer’s book are misleading, incorrect, and unfortunate, given the potential seriousness of the problem.

Red is an increase in the average temperature,     and blue is a decrease in average temperature. The large increase     in 1982 was caused by the volcanic eruption of El Chichon, and     the increase in 1991 was caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo     in the Philippines. December 1997   and January 1998, were     the coldest months on record for the stratosphere. (If you click     on the chart above, you will get the data with which the chart     was created.)

GX236-58-6584091	"4  S&TR July/August 2002  Our planet's climate is warming up. The effects are, for the first time, visible on a regional scale.  G  LOBAL warming. Few phrases elicit so much controversy today. But is our climate truly changing? And if it is, do we know why it is changing? At the United Nations, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) certainly thinks the world is getting warmer and puts much of the blame on human activity. In its 2001 Third Assessment Report, the IPCC projects that average global temperature will increase by 1.6 to 6C by 2100. The report indicates that, globally, the 1990s were the warmest decade on record, with 1998 the single warmest year. Accompanying this global-scale temperature increase were changes in other climate variables, such as precipitation, snow cover, glacier extent, and sea level. The changes in these variables are broadly consistent with the IPCC's estimate that Earth's  surface warmed by roughly 0.6C over the 20th century. The 2001 IPCC report concluded that ""there is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activity."" Atmospheric carbon dioxide and other trace gases help keep our planet warm by absorbing some of the Sun's heat that the Earth would otherwise emit back into space. This natural greenhouse effect makes Earth's surface about 34C warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases. But human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, for example, have increased by about 30 percent since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. This human-caused enhancement of the natural greenhouse effect has contributed to the warming of the planet over the last century. Climate change can occur even in the absence of human activities. The climate system is like a bell that rings in a certain way. One form of ""ringing"" is  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  5  El Chichn  Mount Pinatubo  Height, hectopascals  El Nio 1997 to 1998  the ocean warming phenomenon known as El Nio or its cooling sister, La Nia. Such changes are thought to be due to the internal variability of the climate system. But external events can also cause natural climate changes. Large volcanic eruptions can pump massive quantities of dust into the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere). The dust may remain in the stratosphere for years, cooling Earth's surface by absorbing and reflecting some of the incoming sunlight. Natural changes in the Sun's energy output and slow changes in Earth's orbit can also influence climate. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases get the most press, but there are other human influences as well. Changes in land use can be a concern. For example, Livermore scientists recently showed that human-caused changes in land-use patterns (especially conversion of forests to farm land) may have caused a gradual global cooling of approximately 0.25C, mostly before the 20th century. Large-scale burning of rain forests sends particulate matter into the lower atmosphere, warming us. At the same time, with fewer trees, less carbon dioxide can be absorbed from the atmosphere, which warms us further. Land surface changes also affect Earth's reflectivity, or albedo. If Earth is getting warmer, is it possible to expose individual factors  Globally averaged temperatures have changed at different levels in Earth's atmosphere. This profile is from close to Earth's surface through to the stratosphere. Temperatures are in the form of departures (anomalies) from long-term monthly means computed from 1979 to 1999 and are in degrees Celsius. The stratospheric warming caused by the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruptions is clearly evident, as is the cooling of the lower atmosphere after Pinatubo. Results are from the so-called reanalysis project jointly performed by the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  causing climate change? And what will global warming mean on a regional level? Two Livermore research teams are searching for--and finding--answers. Atmospheric scientist Ben Santer, a 1998 John A. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow, has used sophisticated climate models to separate the effects of recent major volcanic eruptions and El Nios from other causes of climate change. The motivation for this research was to shed light on one of the outstanding puzzles in climate science: why Earth's surface has apparently warmed faster than the lower atmosphere. At the same time, a team led by physicist Philip Duffy has brought the highest resolution yet to global climate modeling, revealing a wealth of regional effects for the first time. Instead of a 300-kilometer grid--the previous state  of the art--Duffy's team has been able to perform global simulations using models with grid cell sizes of 75 and even 50 kilometers. These are the finest-resolution global climate simulations performed to date. The figure on p. 6 compares these resolutions. Duffy's work would not be possible without Livermore's massively parallel supercomputers, which can quickly perform the computationally demanding calculations inherent in global climate modeling. The first simulations using the 50-kilometer grid ran on the Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASCI) White computer during its initial, unclassified testing period in December 2000. Because the ASCI White computer is now used exclusively for classified computations, models used by Duffy's group are being  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   6  Climate Modeling  S&TR July/August 2002  run on other supercomputers at Livermore and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A 1-year simulation of global climate using the 300-kilometer grid can now be accomplished in 4 or 5 hours. Five years ago, it would have taken over a day to complete a comparable simulation. For the 50-kilometer grid, ""At best, we can do about a month of simulated climate in a day,"" says Duffy. A 50-kilometer grid for climate modeling was the stuff of dreams 5 years ago. Why the Controversy? Much of the controversy about global warming results from two apparent contradictions. One relates to observed temperature data and the other to the issue of how well computer models of (a) 300-kilometer model  the global climate system can represent such observations. While Earth's surface has warmed by about 0.15 to 0.2C per decade since 1979, temperatures in the troposphere (the layer of the atmosphere extending from Earth's surface to 8 to 16 kilometers above it) have shown little warming, and even a slight cooling. The apparent lack of tropospheric warming from 1979 to the present has been used to cast doubt on the reality of strong surface warming. It is important to understand whether this difference between surface and tropospheric warming rates is real or is an artifact of data problems. If this difference is real, what factors might be causing it? (b) 50-kilometer model  The second puzzle relates to the inability of many climate models to simulate the apparent difference in surface and tropospheric warming rates. This inconsistency is sometimes used to bolster arguments that models are inappropriate tools for making projections of future climate change. Recent work by Santer and his colleagues has addressed both of these puzzles. They have learned that at least some of the differential warming of Earth's surface and lower troposphere is real and attributable to the combined effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, volcanic eruptions, and natural climate variability. Differences in the geographic regions sampled by the surface thermometer network and the satellite-based tropospheric temperature measurements also explain some of the divergent temperature changes of the surface and troposphere. ""But,"" Santer concedes, ""accounting for these effects still does not fully explain the different rates of temperature change. Nor does it explain why models don't reproduce this differential behavior accurately."" A Search for Resolution For several years, Santer has been working with other investigators at Livermore and research institutions around the world to reconcile the apparent contradictions in actual data and global climate models. In one study of climate between 1979 and 1998, they discovered that a model including anthropogenic (humancaused) factors and volcanic aerosols produced surfacetroposphere temperature differences that were the closest yet to actual observed data. As a follow-up, they wanted to examine the influence of volcanoes alone. But, says Santer, ""We had a bit of bad luck. Nature made our lives difficult. There was a major El Nio in  225  500  1,000  1,500 Elevation, meters  2,000  2,500  2,800  The topography of California and Nevada is simulated in models with (a) 300-kilometer and (b) 50-kilometer grids. Models that use the 300-kilometer grid have been the state of the art, but Livermore has developed a 50-kilometer-grid model. Even with 50-kilometer grids, the topography of California and Nevada is not represented. The Coast Range mountains are not visible in (b), and the data smoothing process lowers the elevation of the Sierra Nevada mountains.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  7  1982, at the same time as the eruption of El Chichn in Mexico. A smaller El Nio coincided with the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. This made it tough to disentangle the effects that volcanoes and El Nios had on surface and tropospheric temperatures."" Santer and his Livermore colleagues had been doing similar work for the past 10 years. For the first half of that time, they were trying to identify humancaused climate signals in observed temperature records. This involved using both model and observational climate data to understand the characteristic (a) Lower troposphere  fingerprints of the many natural and anthropogenic influences on climate. (See the figure on p. 8.) Previous researchers had attempted to remove the effects of explosive volcanic eruptions and El Nios from surface and tropospheric temperatures so they could obtain better estimates of the underlying human component of climate change. But Santer's team was the first to deal fully with the correlation of volcanic eruptions and El Nios, known in statistical problems as collinearity. The team's observational data were land and ocean surface temperatures (b) Earth's surface 1979  compiled at the Climatic Research Unit in Norwich, England, together with satellite-based tropospheric temperature measurements. Their model data came from a number of different sources: the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Researchers from all of these organizations participated in the team. Other team members were with Livermore's Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison,  1980  1998  Geographic patterns of annually averaged temperature anomalies in (a) the lower troposphere and (b) at Earth's surface. Tropospheric temperature measurements are from polar-orbiting satellites, and surface measurements were made by thermometers. White areas denote missing data. Although the satellites have near-global coverage, the surface data have large gaps. Comparing satellite and surface data over areas of common coverage helps to explain some of the differential warming of the surface and troposphere.

The team first dealt with observed data. They found that removing El Nio and volcanic effects always led to larger warming trends in the residual surface and lower tropospheric data than in the raw observational data (where these effects were left in). Although El Nios caused a (a) 10 25 50  small net warming from 1979 to 1999, the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruptions caused a larger net cooling during the same period. Removing both El Nios and volcanoes more clearly revealed the underlying warming trend in surface and tropospheric temperatures. It also helped to explain some of the differential warming of the surface and troposphere.  30 26 22 18  100 14 200 300 500 850 10 Height, kilometers 6 2  (b) 10 25 50 18 100 14 200 300 500 850 60S 45S 30S 15S 0 Latitude 15N 30N 45N 60N 10 6 2 30 26 22  12  10  8  6  4 2 0 2 4 Temperature, degrees Celsius  6  8  10  12  (a) Atmospheric temperature changes predicted to occur in response to a doubling of preindustrial levels of carbon dioxide. (b) Projected temperature response to a 2-percent increase in the Sun's energy output. Each factor that influences our climate has a characteristic ""fingerprint."" Scientists typically use computer models of the climate system to gain information on these fingerprints. In a model, it is possible to study the climatic effects of a single influence only, such as changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide. This is not feasible in the real world, where multiple factors that influence climate are changing simultaneously. Both (a) and (b), which are clearly dissimilar, show annual mean changes (in degrees Celsius) as a function of latitude and altitude.  ""It's clear that if the Mount Pinatubo and El Chichn eruptions had not occurred, the lower troposphere would have experienced more pronounced warming,"" says Santer. The team then removed volcanic and El Nio effects from model output and compared the results with observations. It is important to do this because even in a model with ""perfect"" representation of El Nio variability, the simulated El Nios would not necessarily occur at the same time that they happened in the real world. Also, some model experiments include the effects of well-observed volcanoes (such as Mount Pinatubo) but exclude other eruptions where less is known about the properties of the volcanic aerosols. Removing volcano and El Nio effects from both models and observations allows a fairer comparison of the underlying simulated and observed responses to humancaused changes in greenhouse gases. The general conclusion from such comparisons was that removing volcano and El Nio effects from atmospheric temperature data improves the correspondence of the modeled and observed differential warming of the surface and troposphere over the last several decades. It does not, however, fully reconcile models and reality. The remaining differences are probably caused by problems with the observational temperature data; missing or inaccurately specified ""forcings"" in the climate model experiments, such as the neglect of land use changes or aerosol particles from biomass burning; and errors in the climate responses that the models predict. Santer and his colleagues are actively investigating these possibilities.""We hope we've showed that this is a complex scientific issue,"" says Santer. ""It can't be reduced to a one-minute sound bite. This issue is important, because it relates to our ability to evaluate climate models  Pressure, hectopascals  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  9  and to determine whether these models are useful tools for predicting climate change over the next century."" An Up-Close Look The IPCC's prediction that mean global temperatures will increase from 1.6 to 6C by the end of this century isn't especially useful for farmers and others whose livelihoods depend on the weather. They need more specific information on temperature increases expected in their area, whether it be Kansas or Kenya. They also need to know about changes in temperature extremes and in other important quantities such as precipitation.By providing improved simulations of climate change on regional scales, Livermore's highresolution climate simulations should allow for more accurate assessments of the effects of climate change on society. Grids of 50 kilometers and less are already used in numerical weather prediction, which is much less computationally intensive than climate modeling because it requires much shorter forecasts (days rather than decades). For long-term climate modeling with resolution this fine, scientists had to await the arrival of huge computers with hundreds of processors operating simultaneously. Duffy's team is using the Community Climate Model 3, or CCM3, an atmospheric model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. CCM3, the fourth-generation CCM model, is used at coarse resolutions in climate modeling centers around the world. ""For every change in horizontal resolution, there's the problem of retuning the model,"" says Duffy. Several physical processes such as convection, cloudiness, and precipitation are too small to be represented explicitly in climate models and are therefore treated using semiempirical parameterizations.

After using an iterative method to successively refine estimates of El Nio and La Nia effects on tropospheric temperatures, these effects are removed from the original temperature data in (a). The cooling effects of the El Chichn and Mount Pinatubo eruptions are now more easily seen in (c). It is clear in (d) that removing both volcanoes and El Nio effects yields a pronounced warming trend that was not apparent in the original temperature data.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   10  Climate Modeling  S&TR July/August 2002  For example, although clouds may be too small to be represented directly in a grid cell, they must be accounted for because cloud cover affects the flow of radiation in the atmosphere. ""So we parameterize their effects by modifying the optical properties of that layer of the atmosphere,"" says Duffy. Because these parameterizations are not based on first-principles physics, they must be tuned carefully at each resolution. Tuning is done by adjusting parameter values to make the model's results agree as closely as possible with observations. The 300-kilometer model has already (a) 300-kilometer resolution  been carefully tuned at NCAR to optimize results at that resolution. In collaboration with researchers at NCAR, Livermore researchers retuned their 75-kilometer model. Thus far, tuning done for the 75-kilometer model has also worked reasonably well with the 50-kilometer grid. The team's proof of principle with the 50- and 75-kilometer models was to compare their modeling results to observed data. Although, as Duffy notes, ""the 50-kilometer model actually has better resolution than most of our observational data."" Perhaps not surprisingly, simulations using the  50-kilometer model agreed better with observed data than either a 75- or 300-kilometer grid. In some cases, there were substantial improvements. When the team examined results in more localized regions of interest, the results were striking. The upper figure below shows simulated precipitation over the U.S. in December, January, and February using 50-, 75-, and 300kilometer grids and compares all three to observed data.

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR July/August 2002  Climate Modeling  11  that as spatial resolution becomes finer, not only is fine-scale detail added to the model results, but the large-scale aspects of the solution also become more realistic. Simulations of California climate are a real test of climate models because of the great variability in climate that occurs within the state's relatively small area. Much of this variability results directly or indirectly from the state's major topographic features: the Coast Range, the Central Valley, and the Sierra Nevada. The figure at left, bottom, compares actual elevations at 50-kilometer resolution with topography as represented in models having 300-, 75-, and 50-kilometer resolutions. Although the topography is more realistic as the model resolution becomes finer, neither the coastal mountains nor the Central Valley are adequately represented in even the 50-kilometer model. In part because of improved representations of topography, the model's ability to simulate precipitation in California improves dramatically as the resolution becomes finer. Nonetheless, 50-kilometer resolution is still not adequate to represent the state's Coast Range and Central Valley; even at this resolution, the simulation of precipitation differs noticeably from observations. Simulations of Arctic climate similarly improve dramatically with finer resolution, but further improvements are nonetheless needed. Most coarseresolution oceanatmospheresea ice climate models produce poor simulations of the pattern of sea-level pressure in the Arctic region.

In addition to these simulations of the present climate, Duffy's team has simulated the effects of increased greenhouse gases (that is, global warming) with the 75-kilometerresolution model. This is the finestresolution simulation of global warming performed to date and shows very different results from comparable simulations performed at coarser resolutions. Although the globally  averaged responses of temperature and other variables to increased greenhouse gases are quite similar in the 75-kilometer model and in coarserresolution models, the regional responses can be very different. For example, the figure on p. 12 shows predicted wintertime temperature changes between 2000 and 2100 in the U.S. The finer-resolution model shows regions of strong warming in the western U.S. and southeastern Canada, which are not predicted by the coarser-resolution model.

Temperatures at the Antarctic Peninsula have increased by 2.5C over the last 50 years, much faster than the global average. Getting Arctic and Antarctic models right is crucial for determining what may happen to sea levels around the world as temperatures continue to rise. Closing in on how much humans are responsible for the changes in our planet's climate is equally important. Getting it right matters to us all. --Katie Walter Key Words: climate modeling, Community Climate Model 3 (CCM3), global warming, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

GX012-85-2483942	"At first glance, the themes considered under the purview of Earth System Science (ESS) might seem to be a hodgepodge of unrelated subjects. While the actual interrelationships may at first glance seem unconnected on this page, it does give several examples of some of the frequently cited topics in different subjects under study (e.g., volcanic eruptions, ocean parameters (particularly sealevel rise), the Greenhouse effect, polar temperatures; El Niño; the Ozone Hole), while showing how observations from space contribute to monitoring these phenomena. Of special interest are the predicted changes in temperatures, sugar maple distribution, and grain yield, regionally or globally, if the current mean carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere is doubled.      Evidence for Global Warming:   Degradation of Earth's Atmosphere; Sealevel Rise; Ozone Holes; Vegetation Response        ""Global change"". ""Greenhouse effect"". ""Global warming"". The media are full of statements, concerns, guesses, and speculation about these phenomena, as scientists and policy-makers around the world struggle to address recent scientific observations that indicate human activities impact our environment. And yet, each of these is a ""natural"" phenomenon, as are many others. Hurricanes, droughts, and monsoons all occur without any control by humans, to initiate, forestall or moderate them.       We can learn about our planet's interacting physical systems by observing the results of such natural phenomena, and use our knowledge to explore human-induced changes. Consider, for example, the eruption of a volcano, such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippine Islands in 1991, that happened without human intervention. This volcano had been dormant for more than 600 years.                    When a volcano erupts it spews millions of tons of ash, debris, and gases into the atmosphere, not to mention the lava flows from some volcanoes. Because of the presence of instruments - on the ground, at the ocean's surface, and in space - we observed a cloud of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), emitted by Pinatubo, make its way westward, extending well past India within twelve days of the original eruption. By three months, that cloud had completely encircled the Earth, as shown from space (below), and inside of a year SO 2  particles in the atmosphere were providing gloriously-colored sunsets all over the globe and lowering global temperatures, as well. Clearly, an erupting volcano impacts more people and places than just within its immediate vicinity.                      16-4:  Why does the Pinatubo ash tend to stay confined to a wide equatorial zone?  ANSWER       Mt. Pinatubo offers a stellar example of how monitoring from space can continually update the status of transient ground events (that, in unpopulated areas [not the case in Luzon] may go unnoticed. Below are two SIR-C radar color composites (L-band HH = red; L-band HV = green; C-band = blue) taken in May (left) and September (right) of 1995, both showing the effects of the 1991 eruption. Ash from an earlier phase of the 1991 event appears in red just above the summit of the volcano .                      16-5:  There is one noticeable change in the right radar image. Find it. Make a guess as to its cause (clue: the volcano didn't erupt between May and September of 1995).  ANSWER       Another fascinating example of a natural phenomenon, we know as El Niño, because it occurs with some regularity (although not complete predictability) around Christmas time. El Niño refers to the baby Jesus, whose birthday we celebrate at the end of December. When an El Niño occurs, a pool of warm water from the western Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the western coast of South America. In the process, weather patterns around the world changes often to the detriment of human populations–as do South American fish populations. In non-El Niño years, fish are abundant in this region, because of the cold, nutrient-filled waters. When an El Niño occurs, that cold water flows deep into the Pacific, and fish populations decline dramatically, with concomitant effects on humans whose livelihood depends on those fish.                  Other such phenomena abound. Some are readily observable by space sensors, particularly meteorological and oceanographic measurements (see Section 14). As examples, consider these near-global plots. The top from comes from the Seasat Radar Scatterometer and shows prevailing wind patterns over the oceans at supercontinental scales. The bottom one depicts the mean day, night, and day-nite temperatures of the Earth's land and sea surfaces, averaged for January of 1979, from Nimbus 6's High-resolution Infra-red Sensor (HIRS) 3.4 and 4.0 µm channels ( page 14-4 ), integrated with MSU microwave and infrared data. Suffice to say that even without human contributions Earth is a dynamic system, one that changes routinely and often drastically.                                             In addition to the observed phenomena described above, scientists have accumulated other relevant, environmental recordings. For example, levels of several trace gases in our atmosphere have been rising and continue to rise. This change in atmospheric gas composition may be the most serious threat to the global well-being of Earth's environment. Information about this has been nicely summarized in an October, 1997 pamphlet entitled  Climate Change: State of Knowledge , prepared and distributed by the President's Office of Science and Technology (OST), from which information and selected illustrations on this page have been extracted.    One of these gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has been increasing at an accelerating rate since the middle of the last century, after many, many years of essentially stable levels. Why is this? A simple explanation is that the Industrial Revolution began at about the time these increases started. With that social upheaval, came the use of biomass and coal for fuel to support these new industries. Burning such material generates CO 2 .                Other trace gases have been rising, as well. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is particularly deletorious. Methane (CH 4 ), from rice paddy production and enteric fermentation, is increasing, as are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that have been used for many years as a refrigerant and to produce foam.                                              16-6:  The carbon dioxide curve shows regular oscillations (much like a sine curve). Why? With what do these three curves best correlate?  ANSWER       These gases contribute to the greenhouse effect that is warming our atmosphere to the levels we now record. The greenhouse effect results from the trapping of solar radiation that reflects from the Earth’s surface by these (and other) gases.  This is illustrated below.       The atmosphere is essentially transparent to incoming solar radiation. After striking the Earth's surface, the wavelength of this radiation increases as it loses energy. The gases we discussed are opaque to this lower energy radiation, and therefore trap it as heat, thereby increasing the atmospheric temperature. As these gases increase, due to natural causes and human activity, they enhance the greenhouse effect, and may raise temperatures even more. If the climate warms, the vegetation belts will tend to move northward, changing global ecological and biome patterns. Other effects may be discerned in precipitation patterns, sea level changes, and more.        Clearly, global mean annual temperatures are rising, and we continue to monitor this condition with space observations to help settle the question: how much is just a natural trend (e.g., inevitable interglacial warming) and how much is due to man's activities? Calculations show that the burning of fossil fuels (mainly coal, petroleum derivatives, and natural gas) add about 6 billion metric tons of carbon (as the element) to the air annually; each year also, deforestation permits an extra 1-2 billion metric tons of carbon to reach the atmosphere.    As an indication of how much worldwide temperatures have risen in the last few years, this next map of the globe shows temperature anomalies, with measurements from various sources as compiled by NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Science), for the 9 month period in 2001 as shown.       GISS is continually refining its models. Daily inputs improve the credibility of the predictions. Now that Aqual (page 16-11) is operational, its AMSR instrument can provide global data covering very short time spans. This map is of worldwide surface temperatures on August 27, 2003:       The trend of temperature changes on an annual and 5 year running average proves that in the second half of the 20th Century the global atmosphere has been slowly warming - about 0.5 ° C, as shown here:       GISS has designed its model to predict both sea surface and surface air temperatures up to 50 years in the future. Here is a recently published forecast, which suggests that under current trends the temperature rise will be somewhat greater (more than 1 °C) than the last 50 years:       Scientists need to establish a long-term data base, which includes temperatures from previous centuries. One way to estimate past temperatures is from CO 2  measurements of  air trapped in glacial ice that has been accumulating for thousands of years. The plot below shows the general trend in rising CO 2  during the last 160,000 years (includes recent ice ages), with estimates of temperatures (derived from a CO 2  model) shown for comparison.      The next two graphs provide more details on the increasing levels of CO 2  during the last 140 years. The top shows carbon dioxide concentration increases, based on ice core measurement until 1960 and Mauna Loa Observatory measurements thereafter. Below it is the measured temperature changes averaged for the entire world; the trend upwards, amounting to about 1.5° F, shows some irregularities (not smoothly cyclic) which result from other climatic factors.         Armed with the data that relate CO 2  increase to temperature rise, models allow prediction of the global distribution of changing temperatures if the total amount of carbon dioxide in the air were to double or quadruple from today's values (arbitrarily set at 275° F). The 4x case could be truly catastrophic, leading to worldwide deserts unless the added heat in the atmosphere also notably increase vegetation growth (to tropical forms). Thus:            One obvious consequence of the significant rise in CO 2  in the northern polar latitudes would be melting of Arctic Ocean and Greenland Ice Cap ices, releasing huge quantities of stored water that would have an extremely serious impact on global sea levels. A rise to 550 ppm CO 2  by the end of year 2100 would bring about rises from 8 to 37 inches, enough to greatly modify present beach and shoreline configurations and even submerge such cities and New Orleans and Venice (which is also presently sinking because of groundwater withdrawal).    Evidence has been building, through satellite and ground measurements, that the Arctic region of the northern hemisphere has been steadily warming. This is summarized in this map of that upper northern hemisphere using data from the last 30 years. The Arctic ice shelf has responded by thinning. Further south, the western U.S. and Siberia are both in a warming trend. Note that the only region that has cooled during this time is in eastern Canada-Greenland.        A somewhat more precise map of temperature changes in the Arctic covering the two decades between 1972 and 1992 has been constructed from meteorological satellite data as shown here:        The net effect has been an overall shrinkage of the outer extent of the main sea ice cover within the Arctic Circle, as indicated here (lavender line is 1987 position; blues indicate decrease in ice thickness whereas yellows and reds show some thickening).       This can be displayed visually using data from the SSMI (Special Sensor Microwave Imagery) instrument, taken in 1979 and again in 2003. The Arctic Ocean appears to be opeining up off eastern Siberia and northern Alaska.      Despite the interior cooling of Greenland (suggesting enough snow to increase the ice cap's thickness), the edge of this ice cap is currently shrinking as confirmed by two separate aerial/ground studies in which remote sensing played a part. A NASA team made survey passes across Greenland by air using a laser altimeter to measure elevations. A second group used the Global Positioning System (GPS) ( page 11-6 ) to track movements of ice. When both results were analyzed, the map shown below was constructed. It shows increase in ice in the central part of this huge island (possibly related to the recent winter cooling) but significant shrinking near the edges (increases in summer temperature). The net loss of ice is estimated to be 51 cubic kilometers a year, enough to fill a lake 30 miles long, 30 miles wide, and 70 feet deep (spread globally to the oceans this would cause a rise of 0.005 inches a year; this contributes 7% of the total rise now being measured).       This map shows similar results from a different perspective:       Scientists visiting Greenland in the last few years have remarked about significant increases in the onset of melting along the edge of the western fringes. This is visible in MODIS images taken from 2001 into 2003, with the zone of active melting showing up as a darker gray (presence of water):        On page  14-14  evidence of major changes in Antarctica were discussed. This is in response to notable rises in temperature; in the Antarctic Peninsula, a cumulative rise between 2 to 3°C (3.6 to 5.4°F) has occurred in recent years. In the late few years parts of the fringing ice shelves have broken loose as massive ice bergs floating northward. Use of laser altimetry and interferometric measurements of data obtained by InSAR (Interferometric SAR) are showing up as annual velocities of ice movement both within the continent and along its edges, as seen in this composite image:         The Antarctic ice shelves appear in gray in this map. Letters indicate 33 named glaciers. As the ice sheets thin and break off, the glaciers respond by increased (accelerating) outward flow. The West Antarctic ice sheets (primarily the Ross Shelf) are losing ~65 cubic kilometers per year, enough to raise ocean levels by 0.16 mm/yr; worldwide sealevel is rising by 1.8 mm/yr (0.7 inches/yr), primarily from Arctic, Antarctic, and Greenland sources. Scientists have calculated that if all of the ice in Greenland and the Antarctic were to completely melt through significant warming the worldwide sealevel would rise 70 meters (230 feet), which would be catastrophic to the large fraction of global populations living near continental edges    Another sign of global warming would be shifts in the distribution of both natural vegetation and food crops. Consider this next diagram which is a map pair showing, on the left, the current range of the common sugar maple with the shift that could occur from just the predicted temperature rise associated with a CO 2  increase to 700 ppm, and, on the right, a more drastic withdrawal northward if soil moisture reduction is included. This happens simply because the climate zone that favors this maple is sensitive to specific temperature and moisture ranges.           This shift in vegetation is still being demonstrated. Measurements of green leaf distribution and other measures of vegetation (various Veg. Indices) over the last 20 years using satellite data have now revealed a substantial increase in the ""greening effect"". A study reported in the journal Science includes a map that shows the regions of the world that have experienced greater vegetation development and areas losing vegetation, largely as a result of climate changes:         In parts of the northern hemisphere, the increase seen in this summary diagram (purple is highest; green lowest increase) shows a distinct distribution in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The first Spring leafing is now about 1 week earlier and Fall loss of leaves is almost a week later. The most likely explanation is the warming effect of greenhouse gases and the greater availability of CO 2 .           Even more alarming would be the changing conditions that are suitable to supporting certain staple crops. A CO 2  rise to 550 pm would redistribute crop yields worldwide for common grains, as shown below. Note that warming in the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere would favor increases in crop production in Canada/Alaska, Scandinavia, and most of Europe and Russia but changes in South America and most of Africa would move towards drops in yield.          Another observable global change, caused by certain trace gases in the atmosphere, including the CFCs, is the depletion of stratospheric ozone. Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs incoming solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) that is dangerous to living systems. This UVR causes damage to the genetic material in living systems. Ozone prevents the UVR from reaching the Earth’s surface , and so protects us from its harmful effects. Spacecraft sensors have observed ozone depletion during the Antarctic winter, an observation that helped determine the chemistry underlying this process. Over the south pole, the right combination of cold stratospheric temperatures, ice crystals (or other solids with surfaces upon which the destruction chemistry occurs), and the global wind patterns intensify the process. Space sensors have observed similar (although smaller) depletions in the Arctic, and some of the chemical agents are increasing over mid-latitude regions, i.e., where most humans live.       These depletions have come to be known as ""ozone holes"". That this is an apt description is evident in this image of the Antarctic variations in ozone level that have been depicted in 3-D by ""contouring"" the different values:                         The size and extent of the ""hole"" varies with time as is obvious in this series of October Antarctic ozone maps taken between the years 1979 and 1992.                    16-7:  Comment on the patterns of ozone change you decipher from the above October sequence.  ANSWER          Other human activities may increase the rate of global change. One activity now grabbing attention is deforestation, whereby humans slash and burn, or just clear-cut, huge tracts of trees to use the land for agriculture or the wood for building shelters. As developers denude these large regions, biodiversity decreases, and land-use, water run-off patterns, and local weather phenomena change. Satellite remote sensing has produced dramatic images of progressive deforestation, as witnessed in these two scenes taken five years apart over the State of Rondonia in the Brazilian Amazon Basin by NOAA's AVHRR.                           16-8:  Estimate the percentage increase in deforestation in the middle of the image pair (eastern Rondonia). ANSWER                  All in all, the evidence seems to be mounting that there is a definite increase in regional and global temperatures. One sign, not commonly cited, is the progressive migration toward the poles of various animals and birds. In North America, rattlesnakes (very sensitive to temperatures) have moved into New England and the Canadian Great Plains. Tropical and desert birds found in Mexico are now spilling over into Texas and Arizona. Populations of the Snowy Owl have been decreasing in the Arctic (ecologists surmise that this is due to a large drop in the lemning population, the owls chief food source). Some of this temperature rise may by natural (warming trends during interglacial intervals are the norm); some is now recognized by experts as the consequence of manmade perturbations to the atmosphere.         Thus, many observations and other data seem to point to humans as a major causative source, having at least the potential for modifying global phenomena. However, we are not always sure of this. We continue to wonder if some of the observed changes, such as an apparent increase in atmospheric temperature, are really due to human activities? Or are they part of a natural cycle that we are only now observing in detail, because of the presence of instruments and sensors that were hitherto not available? We also ask whether the current trends will continue and how detrimental they may be.                                      Primary Contact: Nicholas M.

GX012-22-12759953	Global surface temperature has been measured since 1880 at a network of  ground-based and ocean-based sites.  Over the last century, the average  surface temperature of the Earth has increased by about 1.0 o   F. The eleven warmest years this century have all occurred since 1980,  with 1995 the warmest on record (Figure 7).   The higher latitudes have warmed more than the equatorial regions.   Beginning in 1979, satellites have been used to measure the temperature  of the atmosphere up to a height of 30,000 feet.  The long-term surface  record and the recent satellite observations differ, but that fact is not  surprising: the two techniques measure the temperature of different parts  of the Earth system (the surface, and various layers of the atmosphere).   In addition to this, a variety of factors, such as the presence of  airborne materials from the 1991 eruption of the volcano Mt. Pinatubo,  affect each record in a different way.  Satellite observations were  initially interpreted as showing a slight cooling, but more recent  analyses accounting for natural, short-term fluctuations imply warming,  just as the ground-based measurements have indicated over a longer time  period.  As more data from the satellite record become available, and as  the quality of measurements is improved, comparison of these two records  should yield additional insights.   What does warming do?  A warmer Earth speeds up the global water cycle:  the exchange of water among the oceans, atmosphere, and land.  Higher  temperatures cause more evaporation, and soils will tend to dry out  faster.  Increased amounts of water in the atmosphere will mean more rain  or snow overall.    We may be seeing the first signs of changes in the water cycle.  Since  the beginning of the century, precipitation in the United States has  increased by about 6 percent, while the frequency of intense  precipitation events (heavy downpours of more than two inches per day)  has increased by 20 percent.  Such events can cause flooding, soil  erosion, and even loss of life (Figures  8  and    9  ).  In some midcontinental areas,  increased evaporation has led to drought because the heavy rains fell  elsewhere.     There is also evidence that ecosystems are reacting to warming.  Between  1981 and 1991, the length of the growing season in the northern high  latitudes (between 45 o and 70 o  N) increased by a  total of up to twelve days, as documented by satellite imagery.  Greening  in spring and summer occurred up to eight days earlier, and vegetation  continued to photosynthesize an estimated four days longer.    Global mean sea level has risen 4 to 10 inches over the last 100 years,  mainly because water expands when heated.  The melting of glaciers, which  has occurred worldwide over the last century, also contributes to the  rise. Formerly frozen soils (permafrost) in the Alaskan and Siberian  arctic have also begun to melt, damaging both ecosystems and  infrastructure.  Melting and tundra warming will also lead to decay of  organic matter and the release of trapped carbon and methane, creating an  additional source of greenhouse gases.

The analysis supports scientists' claim that human activity is influencing the earth's climate. The findings are published in the December 15 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. NCAR's primary sponsor is the National Science Foundation.   ""Once the volcanic and El Nino influences have been removed,"" says Wigley, ""the overall record is more consistent with our current knowledge, which suggests that both natural and anthropogenic influences on climate are important and that anthropogenic influences have become more substantial in recent decades.""   Volcanic emissions cool the planet by blocking sunlight, while El Nino events raise global temperatures through warmer ocean waters. Sometimes the two occur simultaneously, muddying evidence of any underlying warming trend. During the past two decades, two massive volcanic eruptions--El Chichn in April 1982 and Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991--coincided with significant El Ninos, making trend detection more difficult.   Wigley quantified the effects of major volcanic eruptions and El Nino episodes on global mean temperatures. Overall, he found the cooling effect from sun-blocking volcanic emissions was slightly stronger than the warming effect of the coincident El Ninos. He then removed both from the temperature record to reveal an intensified, step-like warming trend over the past century.   In the raw temperature record--not adjusted for the influence of volcanic eruptions and El Nino events--the warming trend during the past two decades is similar in intensity to an earlier warming (1910 to 1940). Several decades of slight cooling separate the two warm periods. However, ""When ENSO and volcanic effects are removed,"" writes Wigley, ""the recent warming trend increases to 0.25 degree Celsius [from 0.18 degree C] per decade and becomes highly significant compared to the earlier period."" (ENSO stands for El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a term that describes interannual changes in both sea surface temperatures and atmospheric pressure across the Pacific basin.)   The overall result is a long-term warming trend that intensifies by century's end, in sync with increasing emissions of greenhouse gases. Using the raw data, greenhouse skeptics have claimed that the earlier warming's similarity to the later one suggests that both were due to natural variations rather than human activity.   Wigley also quantified and removed the warming influence of the 1997- 98 El Nino from the temperature record of the past decade. He found that of the 16 months in 1997-98 announced by the National Climatic Data Center as record breakers, at least six can be attributed to El Nino rather than to a longer-term global warming. ""The sequence is still unusual, but no more unusual than 1990-91, when an equal number of records occurred in the ENSO-adjusted data,"" writes Wigley. Nevertheless, the past decade's warmth is striking in the overall record.

Sunny  Q A  ""Why is it important to know the method of sea surface temperature determination?""  The value of the sea surface temperature (""SST"") depends to some extent on how it is measured. An increasing number of ships are being fitted with thermometers that are fastened to the inside skin of the hull (""hull contact sensors""). Provided that they are kept in calibration, we believe that these instruments give the most accurate SST values. The plot shows the average difference between SST values from Engine Room Intake (""ERI"") thermometers and those from hull contact sensors (dotted line).  1.0 Night... 0.8 SST difference (C)  Day...  0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 -0.2 200 400 600 800 1000 1 3 5 7 0  -0.4  Total Cloud cover/ Heating from the sun (oktas) (W/m2)  For both day and night the ERI values are warmer by about 0.3 to 0.4C.

Compared to the period between 1960 to 1990, in earlier years both the air and the sea were colder by a few tenths C. In more recent years warmer air and sea temperatures have been observed. These changes, detected in the weather reports from Voluntary Observing Ships, suggest that rapid global warming, is occurring perhaps due to changes in the atmosphere caused by man. As a result many countries have agreed to limit the release of gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Some countries have taken measures which have a direct impact on the everyday lives of their citizens - taxes on power consumption for example. In other countries there remain doubts as the degree of warming After all the changes are relatively small and the graph could only be plotted after making significant corrections to the data. To really understand these changes it is important that in future we obtain data of the highest accuracy - the VOS-Clim project will help in this. Remember, if the predictions are correct rising sea level could be catastrophic for some island states. Storms of increasing frequency and strength would be associated with high winds and more frequent damaging floods. Your observations will help us tell to what extent this is already happening. In fact, we urgently need to understand the climate better we need high quality data - we are asking you to help!   Q A  ""I've been making marine weather observations for many years... so why are they particularly important now?"" We have described how the marine weather observations from the past are providing vital information on the world's climate, and have highlighted the present increases in global temperatures. With improving understanding of the weather, more data from satellites, and improved computer models to help in weather forecasting, there is now an emphasis on obtaining ever higher quality measurements over the ocean. The ships in the VOS-Clim project have been chosen as the ships which we believe can provide the high quality reports which we need.  Q A  ""Will the way we make weather observations change in the future?"" Better instrumentation has already been successfully tested on research ships and prototype systems are being installed on a few Voluntary Observing Ships. But these instruments are very expensive. Once the VOS-Clim project has demonstrated the values of a chosen high quality subset of the VOS the possibility of equipping them with advanced instrumentation will be much higher.  Q A  ""So are there any direct benefits to the shipping industry?"" The VOS-Clim project will help in the development of future marine meteorological systems which are expected not only to produce better marine weather forecasts, but also to give ships much more comprehensive real-time weather information for operational purposes. In participating in the VOS-Clim project the shipping industry will also be helping mankind face one of its greatest challenges... to face the large scale weather changes associated with a changing climate.

GX255-91-1957115	"4  S&TR April 2003  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  5  Computer models reveal the significant effects of aerosols resulting from human activity.  O  NE of the most controversial scientific issues is determining the causes of the gradual warming of Earth's atmosphere over the past century, especially the last 50 years. Lawrence Livermore scientists have been among the leaders in modeling global climate change to better understand the nature of the warming, to predict the probable climate in the coming decades, and to determine the role of anthropogenic (human) activity in climate change. Until recently, the most important factor in global climate change appeared to be the steady accumulation of greenhouse gases, mainly produced by the burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, and power plants. These greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are known to trap sunlight and thereby warm the atmosphere. Close observations of global temperature records over the past 50 years have shown less global  warming than predicted by computer models that include only accumulations of greenhouse gases. The explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that increasing concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols in the atmosphere may be cooling the planet and so partially counteracting the effects from the greenhouse gases. In the past 10 to 15 years, scientists have also begun to consider how aerosols, microscopic particles directly suspended in the atmosphere or trapped in clouds, may be changing the planet's climate. Beginning in the early 1990s, calculations showed that aerosols composed of sulfates (a form of sulfuric acid and a main component of air pollution) could be cooling the atmosphere by backscattering incoming solar radiation. The process works in much the same manner as volcanic eruptions, which spew many tons of sulfates into the higher atmosphere that eventually result in the cooling of Earth's climate. (See the box on pp. 1011.)  Spotlight on Aerosols In the past few years, intriguing data from ground stations and satellites, together with insight gained from computer models, have made aerosols a major focus of atmospheric research. ""Ten years ago, the focus was on greenhouse gases. Now aerosols are getting the attention,"" says Livermore atmospheric scientist Catherine Chuang. Chuang notes, however, that large variations in aerosol concentrations have made it difficult to confidently assess the magnitude of their effects on climate. Aerosol chemistry and physics, especially in clouds, are complex and not completely understood. Particles typically remain aloft in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) for a week or less, in contrast to greenhouse gases, which can persist for about a century. Because they are short-lived, aerosols do not mix homogeneously around the planet's atmosphere, and so concentrations differ greatly from one region to the next. What's more, aerosols come in a wide range of  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   6  Aerosols and Climate Change  S&TR April 2003  particle sizes, with particles smaller than a micrometer exerting comparatively greater climatic effects. As a result, says Chuang, one of the greatest uncertainties in climatic change is the role played by anthropogenic aerosols. To reduce these uncertainties, scientists are turning to sophisticated computer simulations in an attempt to gain insight into aerosols' climatic effects. During the past few years, Chuang and colleagues including Joyce Penner (now at the University of Michigan), Keith Grant, Jane Dignon, Peter Connell, Daniel Bergman, and Douglas Rotman have used Livermore's TeraCluster2000 multiparallel supercomputer and the resources of the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to model how anthropogenic aerosols affect global and regional 3  climate. The researchers' simulations show in unprecedented detail how aerosols are partially offsetting the effect of global warming and changing the properties of clouds. In some industrial regions, the generation of aerosols from fossil fuel combustion and biomass (forest and grassland) burning may be as important to climate change as greenhouse gases. Also, climate changes caused by aerosols vary significantly by season and by region. The research team belongs to the Atmospheric Chemistry and Aerosols Group, part of the Atmospheric Science Division of Livermore's Energy and Environment Directorate. The team's advanced simulations, whose findings have been corroborated by field measurements at different geographical locations, build on Livermore's expertise in aerosols, climate, chemistry, and  supercomputer simulations. The research has received funding from the Department of Energy, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and Laboratory Directed Research and Development. The work also contributes to fulfilling the goals of the federal government's National Aerosol Climate Interactions Program, an interagency effort created last year. Chuang explains that aerosol concentrations from natural sources, such as volcanoes, sea spray, and desert dust storms, are believed to have remained generally steady over the past century. However, like greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols have increased markedly since 1950. Based on satellite data, models, and information on urban and agricultural activities, scientists  Greenhouse gases  2 Radiative change, watts per square meter Carbon dioxide  Aerosols  1 Hydrocarbon Nitrogen oxide 0 Tropospheric ozone Sulfate Halocarbons Stratospheric ozone  Fossil fuel Biomass burning burning (black (black carbon) carbon)  Mineral dust  Tropospheric aerosol indirect effect  Fossil fuel burning (organic carbon)  1  Biomass burning (organic carbon)  2  Global climate change by greenhouse gases and aerosols since 1750.

A vertical line between two data points indicates scientific uncertainty regarding the estimated contribution of a particular factor.  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  7  believe anthropogenic aerosols currently contribute about half of the total submicrometer-size aerosols in the atmosphere. Most of the anthropogenic aerosols are sulfates and carbonaceous compounds produced by the burning of fossil fuels and biomass. Solar Reflection Means Cooling When directly suspended in the atmosphere, most aerosol particles exert a direct cooling effect on the global climate by scattering sunlight back into space. Aerosols also exert a significant indirect effect by serving as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for raindrops to form. Increases in CCN result in clouds with more but smaller droplets, thereby increasing the cloud's reflectivity of solar radiation, or albedo. Clouds with (a) Sulfate, maximum 15.87 g/m3 Latitude, degrees 60 30 0 30 60 180 120 60 0 60 120 180  numerous small droplets tend to last longer and so prolong the cooling effect. Complicating matters is the recently discovered influence of black carbon aerosols, such as soot (incompletely burned carbon), that absorb heat instead of reflecting it back into space. Black carbon aerosols are particularly prevalent over parts of Europe, eastern China, and India, where much coal is burned. Beginning in the early 1990s, Chuang focused first on modeling the direct effects of anthropogenic sulfate aerosols because they were thought to be the most important compound involved in pollution over China, Europe, and the eastern coast of the United States. She then added the contribution from carbonaceous compounds because of their sizable  emission from many industrialized regions of the Northern Hemisphere and tropical regions where agricultural burning is prevalent. The simulations also took into account the solar absorptive properties of black carbon, the first time this effect had been modeled. The simulations showed that biomass aerosols suspended in the clear sky cool the climate by between 0.16 and 0.23 watts per square meter, while black carbon from fossil fuels heats the climate by between 0.16 and 0.20 watts per square meter. Also, sulfate aerosols cool the atmosphere by between 0.53 to 0.81 watts per square meter. The sum of the cooling effects ranges between 0.35 and 0.65 watts per square meter. (To place these figures in perspective, about 340 watts per square meter of  (b) Organic matter, maximum 21.65 g/m3 (c) Black carbon, maximum 4.65 g/m3  180 120  60 0 60 120 Longitude, degrees  180  180 120  60  0  60  120  180  0  0.1 0.5  1  2  4  8  12  16  0  0.5  1  2  4  8  12  16  22  0 0.05 0.1 0.5  1  2  3  4  5  Concentration, micrograms per cubic meter (g/m3)  (d) Sea salt, maximum 16.79 g/m3 Latitude, degrees 60 30 0 30 60 180 120 60 0 60  (e) Dust, maximum 1,726 g/m3 Aerosols vary greatly from region to region.

Chuang's research then moved to the vastly more complex task of modeling the indirect effects of anthropogenic sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols through their interaction with clouds. These simulations indicated that the indirect effects of aerosols are greater than the direct effects. The simulations also showed that aerosols can mask the warming effects of greenhouse gases, at least in regions with high pollution levels. AerosolCloud Interactions The simulations estimated that aerosols acting as CCN cool Earth by about 1.85 watts per square meter, with  0.30 watts per square meter associated with anthropogenic sulfate, 1.16 watts per square meter associated with carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, and 0.52 watts per square meter associated with carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel combustion. While concentrations of anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosols are about equal in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, aerosols of anthropogenic sulfates are more prominent in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the simulations showed that concentrations of aerosols vary with the seasons. The global average of indirect effects by anthropogenic aerosols is greatest in April through June, a period  when biomass of savanna and forested areas is burned in the topics. The indirect cooling effect is highest in May, with 2.4 watts per square meter. Chuang also addressed how black carbon absorption affects solar energy in clouds. She found that including this absorption does not decrease the overall cooling effect by more than 0.07 watts per square meter on a global scale, but that locally, it can decrease the cooling effect by as much as 0.7 watts per square meter in regions that have significant black carbon emissions. The model shows that if the effect of black carbon absorption in clouds is not included, the indirect cooling effect by carbonaceous aerosols may be overestimated by up to  (a) Carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning 90 60 Latitude, degrees 30 0 30 60 90  (b) Carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuels  (c) Anthropogenic sulfate aerosols 90 60 Latitude, degrees 30 0 30 60 90 180 120 60 0 60 120  (d) All anthropogenic aerosols  120 180 180 Longitude, degrees  60  0  60  120  180  Simulations show the direct (that is, without interactions with clouds) climate effects of (a) carbonaceous aerosols from biomass burning, (b) carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel burning, (c) anthropogenic sulfate aerosols, and (d) all anthropogenic sources.

The Livermore assessments were based on a three-dimensional general circulation model called Community Climate Model-1 (CCM-1), which was  developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. General circulation models predict global changes that result from changing concentration of gases by dividing the global atmosphere into  tens of thousands of boxes and using the equations describing motion, energy, and mass to predict the changes in climate.

""Both GRANTOUR and CCM-1 were developed more than a decade ago,"" notes Chuang. ""They lack advanced physics and modeling techniques that prevent us from exploring in greater detail the interrelationship between aerosols, clouds, and climate variation.  We believe this interrelationship is the leading source of uncertainty in predicting future climate change."" New Era of Modeling The research team's goal is to move to what Chuang describes as a ""new era of modeling"" that will link the most advanced atmospheric chemistry and climate codes. To that end, last year Chuang and her colleagues added improvements to Livermore's integrated,  massively parallel atmospheric chemical transport (IMPACT) code so that it better represents aerosol chemistry and runs faster on multiparallel supercomputers. IMPACT, which was previously applied by Livermore researchers to global ozone calculations, includes both the stratosphere and troposphere and uses databases of monthly averaged emissions compiled by scientists and government agencies worldwide to treat global chemistry processes.  Aerosols: A Short Primer Aerosols are concentrations of exceedingly minute particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosol particles range in size from 0.01 micrometer (millionth of a meter) to several tens of micrometers in diameter. Particles generated by pollution tend to be less than a millimeter in diameter. The particles enter the atmosphere from many different natural and anthropogenic (human activityrelated) sources. For example, nature generates sulfate aerosols from volcanoes, salt aerosols from sea spray, dust aerosols from desert areas, and carbonaceous aerosols formed from volatile organic compounds emitted by plants. A growing fraction of aerosols are byproducts of human activities, as seen in the ubiquitous hazes that persist in the industrialized regions of the world. Anthropogenic aerosols include sulfuric acid, soot and smoke from the burning of fossil fuels in factories, vehicles, power plants, cookstoves, and fireplaces. The burning of forests and grasslands to clear them for farming is another source of carbonaceous aerosols. (Although dust is typically considered a natural source of aerosols, human activities such as farming or erosion caused by changing land use also kick large amounts of dust into the atmosphere.) Aerosols have a significant effect on climate. Whereas greenhouse gases trap the Sun's heat, thereby warming Earth's atmosphere and surface, aerosols mainly reflect solar radiation, a phenomenon called the aerosol direct effect. By reducing the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface, aerosols serve as agents of climate cooling. Aerosols also cool the climate indirectly, by changing the properties of clouds, which cool Earth by reflecting solar radiation back to space. (Of the daily average of about 340 watts per square meter of solar radiation that reaches the atmosphere, clouds reflect about 45 watts per square meter.) Although commonly thought of as pristine sources of water, clouds could not form without aerosol particles (natural or anthropogenic) acting as cloud condensation nuclei, which are sites on which water droplets can condense. Reflecting Sunlight, Modifying Rainfall Higher concentrations of aerosols in the atmosphere lead to the formation of clouds with water content spread over many more particles. Clouds with smaller, more numerous droplets have a larger surface area and therefore reflect up to 30 percent more sunlight, a phenomenon called aerosols' first indirect effect. What's more, the smaller water droplets in the cloud fall more slowly, thereby prolonging the lifespan of the cloud and strengthening its cooling effect. This second indirect effect is believed to be changing rainfall patterns in populated regions worldwide. Complicating the scientific understanding of aerosols' climatic effects are recent satellite observations revealing that aerosols of black carbon from biomass and fossil fuel burning can absorb sunlight in the atmosphere, thereby increasing the warming effect of greenhouse gases. Satellite observations have also revealed that the absorption of heat by soot can evaporate cloud droplets and thus reduce the presence of clouds. This phenomenon, called the aerosol semidirect effect, is particularly prevalent over heavily polluted areas. Taken together, all of the direct and indirect effects of aerosols are believed to increase Earth's albedo (percentage of sunlight reflected), thereby cooling the surface and offsetting the warming effects of greenhouse gases by 25 to 50 percent globally (and even much more in some areas). However, aerosols' climatic effects cannot be simply compared to those of greenhouse gases because they are distributed in time and space far differently. For example, greenhouse gases are well mixed in the atmosphere and have a lifetime of up to 100 years. In contrast, aerosols suspended in the troposphere (lower atmosphere) last only about a week before they are removed by winds and rain. (The exception is the injection of sulfates into the stratosphere, or upper atmosphere, where they can remain for a few years. The global cooling observed following large volcanic eruptions, such as  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory   S&TR April 2003  Aerosols and Climate Change  11  With the recent revisions, IMPACT can simulate the complicated reactions involving sulfate aerosols that are formed from sulfur dioxide generated by power plants and biomass burning. The code can also account for other sources of sulfates, including the production of dimethylsulfide by plankton, sulfur dioxide by volcanoes, and hydrogen sulfide by soils, forests, and crops. The new version of IMPACT also predicts the concentrations of black carbon and  other carbonaceous compounds, dust, and sea salt as well as their seasonal variations. To better represent the ever-changing size distribution of aerosol particles, Chuang is adapting an aerosol microphysics module developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The module simulates aerosol dynamics through complicated nucleation, growth, and transport processes by tracking the lower order moments of an aerosol size distribution in space and time.  Chuang plans to link IMPACT and the new microphysics module with the Community Climate Model-3, or CCM-3, the fourth-generation model developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research. This climate model allows more realistic and higher resolution simulations of aerosol effects on regional climate. For example, it can show how aerosols are transported to different regions by strong winds and removed by rainfall.  Clouds could not form without aerosol particles (natural or anthropogenic) acting as cloud condensation nuclei or sites on which water droplets can condense. Anthropogenic emissions increase aerosol concentrations and result in clouds with smaller and more numerous droplets. These clouds have a larger albedo (percentage of reflected sunlight) and a longer lifetime, and thus they reflect more sunlight back into space.  that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, provides dramatic evidence for the climatic influence of aerosols.) Also, many anthropogenic aerosols are localized and occur near or downwind from their sources, such as power plants, factories, and large urban populations. As a result, most aerosols are found in the Northern Hemisphere, where most industrialized nations are located. Instrument Data, Models Aid Understanding To accurately study aerosol distribution and composition requires continuous observations from instruments located on satellites and aircraft as well as ground-based field stations. Data from these instruments, combined with numerical models that mimic the formation of aerosols and their interactions with clouds, have led to a much greater understanding of how and to what degree aerosols influence  climate. Lawrence Livermore scientists have been among the leaders in developing these models. Aerosol research marked a turning point in January 2002, when more than 50 leading American atmospheric scientists (including Livermore's Catherine Chuang), together with representatives from federal agencies, met to explore ways to achieve breakthroughs in understanding and modeling aerosols' role in climate change. The meeting led to the formation of a national Aerosol Climate Interactions Program supported by several federal agencies. The program's goals are to more accurately measure the sources, distribution, and properties of aerosols and their influence on climate; to more completely model the processes that govern aerosols' distributions and climatic effects; and to better quantify the relative importance of aerosols and greenhouse gases in global warming, including the effects on regional climates.

Such coarse resolution limits the code's usefulness because it does not adequately represent topographic features that strongly influence surface temperature and precipitation. Much finer resolutions are required to examine regional climate change and the transport of aerosols through the atmosphere. Chuang notes that a Livermore team headed by Philip Duffy has simulated the effects of increased  greenhouse gases by using CCM-3 at 50-kilometer resolution to obtain the finest resolution of global warming performed to date. (See S&TR, July/August 2002, pp. 412.) Putting Everything Together With all the modeling elements in place, Livermore atmospheric scientists will be able to simulate early next year the global and regional climate changes caused by both aerosols and major greenhouse gases. ""With more complete chemistry and physics in our models, we hope to have more accurate answers about how human activities are affecting our climate,"" Chuang says. Ultimately, she says, realistic climate models--augmented by other data-- provide the only viable approach for determining how aerosols are changing the planet's climate and for assessing the effects of future emissions. ""Models are the only tools for making predictions about climate change so that we can help policymakers arrive at the most informed decisions for responding to changes in the environment.""  She notes that at first glance, it might seem that aerosols are a positive element because they tend to counter the effects of global warming. However, purposely allowing a greater buildup of aerosols to offset global warming would lead to greater health and ecological damage. Aerosols that affect climate are associated with air pollution and acid rain, lower visibility, and decreased agricultural production. The results from the advanced Livermore simulations will surely help society as it decides to manage air pollution, global warming, changing rainfall patterns, and the unavoidable effects on human health and society. --Arnie Heller Key Words: aerosols, biomass, black carbon, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), Community Climate Model (CCM), dimethylsulfide, global warming, GRANTOUR, IMPACT, National Center for Atmospheric Research, soot, sulfate.
