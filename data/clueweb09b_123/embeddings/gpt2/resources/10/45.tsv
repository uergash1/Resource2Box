The acupuncture needles used are usually hair-thin, and they are inserted into various points in the ear where they remain for about 20 minutes. For help in between sessions, many acupuncturists provide tiny balls (the size of the tip of a ball point pen), that are taped with invisible tape to the ear. When a craving for cigarettes hits, the smoker is instructed to press gently on the ball, which stimulates the acupuncture point.   A 2006 study analyzed 24 placebo-controlled trials on acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy, or electrostimulation for smoking cessation. There was no consistent evidence that these therapies were effective for smoking cessation. The researchers, however, concluded that further research was needed because the poor design of many of the studies made it difficult to draw a conclusion. One study involving 141 people found that acupuncture plus education on smoking cessation was four times as effective as acupuncture alone. The study also found that acupuncture plus education was twice as effective as sham acupuncture plus education.   For more information about acupuncture, read the  Acupuncture Fact Sheet .   2)  Lobelia The herb lobelia ( Lobelia inflata ) has been promoted to help people fight the effects of nicotine withdrawal and is found in many anti-smoking products. The active ingredient in lobelia, lobeline, is thought to have similar actions on the body as nicotine.  In 1993, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily prohibited the sale of certain lobelia products marketed to help people quit smoking. According to the report, the reason was because evidence showed they were not effective.   Later research has shown that lobeline may increase levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain similar to cigarettes. Dopamine influences mood and produces feelings of pleasure. There is still no evidence, however, showing that lobelia supplements help people quit smoking.  Lobelia is a potentially toxic herb, and should not be used unless under the supervision of a qualified health practitioner. It can cause dry mouth, profuse sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, rapid heartbeat, confusion, convulsions, coma, and in larger doses, even death.  People with heart disease, high blood pressure, heart disease, tobacco sensitivity, paralysis, seizure disorder, shortness of breath, or who are recovering from shock should not take this herb. Pregnant and nursing women and children should also not take lobelia. 3)  St. Johns wort  Although the herb St. John's wort ( Hypericum perforatum )is used primarily for depression, there is some preliminary research on this herb to help people quit smoking. In one pilot study, 24 people who smoked 1 or more cigarettes a day received St. John's wort (450 mg capsule 2 times a day) plus smoking cessation counseling. After 12 weeks, 37.5% or 9 out of 24 people had quit.  Another pilot study found some effect, but the results were not long-term. Twenty-eight smokers were randomized to receive St. John's wort (300 mg once or twice a day), either once or twice daily for one week before quitting and continued for 3 months after. In addition, all participants received motivational/behavioural support. At 3 months, 18% continued to abstain from smoking. At a 12 month followup, it was 0%. Neither study was double-blind or placebo controlled, so they cannot be used as evidence. Although St. John's Wort appears to be reasonably safe when taken alone, it can interfere with the effectiveness of prescription and over-the-counter drugs, such as antidepressants, drugs to treat HIV infections and AIDs, drugs to prevent organ rejection for transplant patients, and oral contraceptives. St. John's wort is not recommended for pregnant or nursing women, children, or people with bipolar disorder, liver or kidney disease.

Dopamine is what makes people feel good after smoking and is part of the addiction process. Although intriguing, no studies to date have examined whether ginseng supplements can help people quit smoking. For more information about ginseng, read the  Ginseng Fact Sheet . 5)  Hypnotherapy  In 2000, a study by the Cochrane Collaboration analyzed nine longer-term studies on the use of hypnotherapy to quit smoking. The researchers found that hypnotherapy was not more effective on 6 month quit rates than other treatments or than no treatment.   Two subsequent studies had more promising results. In 2006, a pilot study examined the effect of hypnotherapy (one visit a week for 8 weeks) or no treatment (people were put on a waiting list). After the 8 weeks, 40% had abstained from smoking. At 12 months, 60% had abstained, and at 26 weeks, the abstinence rate was 4%.  In the second study, researchers looked at 12 hypnosis studies that reported the results by gender and found that the odds of achieving smoking abstinence were 1.37 times greater for male than female participants.

clueweb09-en0008-63-42215	"                          Home Topics Body Quit Smoking   Feel Better: Quit Smoking     "" Smoking is one of the leading causes of statistics ."" letcher Knebel      Fletcher was right. Most smokers have at least one well-meaning soul lurking in the shadows (a suitable distance from that naughty secondhand smoke) who has in hand all the available National Cancer Institute statistics on lung cancer, emphysema, and the evils of tobacco. Pull out a lighter and he or she's all over you, informing you of the latest study proving that smoking leads to a whole bunch of things you already know.   It didn't work. You know all about lung cancer, nicotine, and additives. You also know about weight gain, irritability, cravings, and all those other lovely side effects of quitting. Funny how they rarely get mentioned in the statistics, huh?    Things You May or May Not Know   Someone probably told you what happens when you quit smoking, but did you know that the benefits begin almost immediately?                  Time Since Quitting      Health Changes that Take Place        20 minutes      Blood pressure and pulse rate return to normal.        8 hours      Nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in the blood are cut in half. Oxygen levels in the blood return to normal.        24 hours      Carbon monoxide is completely eliminated from the body. Lungs start to clear out the mucus and other debris of smoking.        48 hours      Nicotine is completely eliminated from the body. Your sense of taste and smell greatly improve.        72 hours      Breathing becomes easier. Energy levels increase. Bronchial tubes relax.        2-12 weeks      Circulation improves.        3-9 months      Lung function improves up to ten percent. Breathing problems (i.e. coughing and wheezing) are reduced.        1 year      Risk of heart attack falls by half.        10 years      Risk of lung cancer falls by half.        15 years      Risk of heart attack falls to the same level as someone who never smoked before.    The Difficulties of Quitting Smoking   Sure you'd like to quit, but so would a majority of other smokers. It's not as easy as it may seem, otherwise everyone would be quitting. Nicotine is addictive, and like any other drug, once it sinks its claws into you, getting them out is going to be an uphill battle.                  Withdrawal Symptom      Duration       Percent of Quitters Affected        Aggression/Irritability      Less than 4 weeks      50%        Craving      More than 2 weeks      70%        Depression      Less than 4 weeks      60%        Increased Appetite      More than 10 weeks      70%        Light-Headedness      Less than 48 hours      10%        Poor Concentration      Less than 2 weeks      60%        Restlessness      Less than 4 weeks      60%    Smokers seem to be in a lose-lose situation. If they continue to smoke, they're at higher risk for a number of lung and heart diseases. If they try to quit, they experience a series of withdrawal symptoms (which are extremely unpleasant) such as weight gain, poor concentration, depression, irritability, and nicotine cravings. And it's not that many smokers don't try to quit. The problem is that quitting is so difficult. Statistics show that only about 2.5 percent of smokers successfully quit each year.    If you truly want to stop smoking, you'll have to deal with the withdrawal symptoms. You must believe that not smoking outweighs all the difficulties you will encounter, or you're not in the right frame of mind to stop. This is a tough decision, and if you're having trouble deciding, a few options can help.   What Are My Options for Quitting?   There's no foolproof way to stop smoking, but you knew that already. You'll probably have to experiment with several different techniques before you stumble across one that works for you.   Nicotine patches:  The patch has a fairly decent track recordbout twenty percent of people who use it have quit and remained smoke-free after six months. It has the convenience of being over-the-counter, but it's wise to consult a doctor before you start anyway, especially if you're pregnant. Possible side effects include skin rashes, nausea, headaches and stomach problems, and children should not come into contact with the patch at all. Most importantly, don't smoke while using the patch! Doing so can rocket your body's nicotine level up to toxic levels, which sort of defeats the purpose if you're quitting for health reasons!   Nicotine gum:  Like patches, nicotine gum is available over-the-counter. Some people prefer it to the patch because chewing gum provides the oral stimulation that also comes from smoking. The goal is to have quit by the end of six months, but some ex-smokers chew it for longer periods. The taste may turn off some people.   Medication:  Certain antidepressants curb nicotine cravings. Obviously, choosing to explore this route requires the involvement and consent of your doctor, who can explain the advantages and disadvantages of using medication to combat smoking.   Hypnosis:  One of the biggest advantages of hypnosis is its non-medicinal approacht can be combined with patches or medication without fear of unwanted physical side effects. It may prove to be what you need to quit, or it may give you enough of a push to let the more physical methods work.   Cold Turkey:  Ah, the macho way to quit! Just say no! Unfortunately, only about three percent of smokers who use this method succeed. Your chances of success rise if you have a good support group, however. Using a scheduled reduction plan, where you slowly reduce cigarette consumption, has also proven itself more effective than just quitting ""cold turkey.""   After You Quit Smoking   If it's not one thing, it's another. With smoking, you've either got the health problems of smoking or the withdrawal symptoms of quitting. If you've decided to quit smoking, good for you! Here's what you can look forward to.     Weight gain:  Smoking is an oral fixation. People who quit usually find something else to do with their restless mouth, such as eating. This can lead to weight gain (and water retention), but don't worry. The average weight gain is about 6 to 8 pounds, but don't let that weigh you down. A few trips to the gym and you'll be back to your smoking weight!   Cravings:  Nicotine is a drug. You're going to crave it for a long time (years). Try and find something to fight your cravingsike caffeine! Just kidding, try something like sugar-free gum, instead.   Other withdrawal symptoms:  The first week is most likely the worst. When the nicotine is completely eliminated from your system (about 2 to 3 days after your last cigarette), you're going to find out what ""a kick in the head"" feels like.     Will you ever feel better?  Let's just say you won't feel worsehat is unless you find breathing through a tracheostoma a step up.                                               Share your thoughts...

I smoked since I was 15. I have not had a cigarrete in almost 5 years. I don't want them anymore. Cravings are only fleeting almost nestalgic and only occure in any sense about 3 or 4 times per year. The entire habit can be removed from your life. Give this to yourself and your loved ones. You can do it!!!!!! Don't be the person pointing to your cigarette telling your kids, ""I don't want you kids to ever do this""                                                  Reply to  Scott                                       Report this Post                                                Name:                              Validate:              <- Type these numbers                     Email:                              Answer:                                                                                                                                                       Posted by  ByTor       November 22, 2008 at 05:45 PM                               Just wanted to say that whoever wants to quit can. Its easy...  I smoked from the age of 13 till 39 about 2 packs a day. I was always nervious about how ""hard"" it was going to be, and had heard that it was tougher then quiting heroin   : O   Long story short, I decided to focus on the gross feeling I sometimes got when I smoked (like the last drag of a smoke ya dident need, YUK!). For some reason that kind of green feeling/taste I just kept in my mind, and i thought of it every time I wanted a smoke. It was kinda like reinforcing in my mind that I hated smoking and that I definatly dident need them. Then, I usually started thinking of all the reasons I wanted to quit, and that I was a complete wimp if I couldent do it. I realized it was ALL in my mind. That, and it really wasent all that tough to not smoke. As a matter of fact it was easy when I related something bad (green feeling)with smoking rather then good. Trust me, I feel sooooooo much better now on so many levels that I cant begin to list them all here. Just know that in the end it\'s well worth it and it\'s really not that tough. ITS JUST ALL IN HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.  GOOD LUCK ALL. AND REMEMBER, ITS EASY.   :  )                                                     Reply to  ByTor                                       Report this Post                                                Name:                              Validate:              <- Type these numbers                     Email:                              Answer:                                                                                                                                                       Posted by  ton       October 05, 2008 at 09:02 AM                               wanted to stop smoking for a long long time. tried once but unfortunately was not successful because of the widrawal symptoms I experienced for 3 weeks.. want to try again tom.. hope this time I'll succeed..

CrossBow Bowflex and  Bandflex  are all similar type gyms that are often seen on TV. Like the   Weider  CrossBow Bowflex uses a rigid set of bars (which resist bending) to provide the resistance.                   At the time of writing this there are 4 models of the Bowflex:                                                             Ultimate                                                               Power Pro                                                               Motivator                                                               Versatrainer                                                         It is very similar to the Weider CrossBow in most ways. Particularly the types of exercises you can do. The major difference between the 2 besides the price is the orientation of the bending bars. On the Bowflex they are parallel to the lat tower but on the CrossBow they are perpendicular.                   The advantages of this gym is are its versatility and the weight. Since there are no weight plates and stacks, the gym is quite light.                   The major disadvantage of this gym is the price. The Bowflex is undoubtedly a fine piece of machinery but so are many other gyms that retail for a much lower price.                   Our choice as the leading alternative to this gym is the    Weider CrossBow   which retails at about half the price of the Bowflex.

Resistance training  is a form of  strength training  in which each effort is performed against a specific opposing  force . Exercises are  isotonic  if a body part is moving against the force. Exercises are  isometric  if a body part is holding still against the force. Resistance exercise is used to develop the  strength  and size of  skeletal muscles . Properly performed, resistance training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall  health  and well-being.
