He moved to the United States in 1852 and founded a settlement at Gum Pond after living in Ohio. In 1880, he opened a post office and had thus to name the village. In memory of his native home he called it  Stuttgart  after  Stuttgart  in  Germany . In 1882, the railroad was opened. Stuttgart became a city in 1884, and in 1904, rice farming was first introduced in the Stuttgart area.     [ edit ]   2008 Tornado   On  May 10 ,  2008  at about 10:30 pm ET,  a large EF3 tornado  struck Stuttgart and destroyed several homes and buildings and injured 9 people. The tornado was featured on an episode of  Storm Chasers  on  November 9 ,  2008 .

[ 4 ]   According to the  United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 6.2 square miles (16.0 km), none of which is covered by water. Hard  clay  underlying the area's  topsoil  is what makes Stuttgart a good place to grow rice, which grows best in flooded fields made possible by the clay. The geography is mainly flat with no outstanding mountainous features with the exception of ""WBA Mountain"", a small artificial mound located west of the city.     [ edit ]   Demographics   As of the  census [ 5 ]  of 2000, there were 9,745 people, 3,994 households, and 2,731 families residing in the city.

Additionally, the city gained a bit of attention during the  sixth cycle  of  America's Next Top Model  in the spring of 2006 when Stuttgart resident Furonda Brasfield was featured among the contestants.   A tornado that struck Stuttgart was featured on the November 9th, 2008 episode of  Storm Chasers  on the  Discovery Channel  when the DOW-6 and TornadoVideos.net teams chase a storm into the town.

[ edit ]   History   The Harrisonville area was originally inhabited by the ""Dhegilha"" Indians subgroup. Being of Siouan linguistic stock, the  Osage ,  Quapaw ,  Omaha ,  Ponca  and  Kansa  tribes comprise this subgroup.   The Kansa tribal range extended southward from the Kansas-Missouri River junction as far as the northern edge of Bates County, Missouri, taking in the sites of modern Pleasant Hill, Garden City, Archie and Drexel. On their southeastern border they were neighbors of the Osage, although there is no evidence that either of these tribes ever had a truly permanent settlement in the territory of Cass County.   At early camp meetings southwest of Harrisonville after Americans came, as many as five hundred Indians were often in attendance and seemed to enjoy religious services as much as the whites [ citation needed ] , with whom they mingled on such occasions. These Indians were reportedly  Shawnees  and  Delawares , both of  Algonquian  linguistic stock.   In 1818 a grant of land in southern Missouri was made to some Delawares, but it was re-ceded by them in 1825, and most of them moved to a reservation in Kansas, while others had previously gone to Texas. Those who remained in the Harrisonville area were close relatives of the  Sauk ,  Fox  and  Kickapoo  tribes.   The first American settler on the site of modern Harrisonville was James Lackey, in 1830. Others early settlers were Humphrey Hunt, John Blythe and Dr. Joseph Hudspeth. Lackey was considered a ""squatter"", as he built a cabin and enclosed a small field on the tract of public land taken for county seat purposes.   Site of the town was fixed under an act of the Missouri General Assembly in 1835, by David Waldo of Lafayette County and Samual Hink and William Brown, both of Jackson County. In the same year, the first court met for the county, known as Van Buren County. The Justices James McClellan and William Savage, met in McClellan's residence about three miles (5 km) southeast of Peculiar on September 14, 1835. William Lyon was appointed clerk of the court and county government was organized , included the setting up of Grand River Township.   In the spring of 1837 the town of Harrisonville was located by Enoch Rice, Francis Prine and Welcome Scott, who had been appointed commissioners by the state legislature in the winter of 1836. These commissioners in company with Matin Rice, the county surveyor, met at the home of John Cook on April 3, 1837 and finally decided on Lackey's pre-emption claim. In May they laid off the town in lots 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the northeast and northwest quarters of Section 4, Township 44N., Range 31W. Within these 160 acres (0.65 km 2 ) there were to be four streets: Wall and Pearl running east to west, Lexington and Independence going north and south, each less than forty feet wide. Fleming Harris was appointed as town commissioner on April 8, 1837. The first town lots were sold on June 12 of that year; those facing the public square sold at $20 each, the others at $10.   ""Democrat"" was strongly urged as a name for the new town but was finally rejected. Instead, the town was named after Albert G. Harrison, a U.S. representative from Missouri.   On October 8, 1835 the first Harrisonville church was organized in the county two miles southwest of town known as Hopewell or New Hope Baptist.   The first house within the town was erected by Jason L. Dickey in 1836.   The first jail in Harrisonville and second for the county was established in 1838. Its site was 312 S. Independence. One of its successors is listed among the state's historic sites.   Harrisonville eventually was served by railroad lines presently known as the Missouri Pacific and the Frisco. Railroad construction was responsible for the notorious ""Gunn City Massacre"", the background of which began in 1857. Cass County approved a large stock subscription for the Pacific Railroad Company. This corporation later surrendered the bonds to the new Saint Louis and Santa Fe Railroad, from whence they were still later assigned to the Land Grant Railroad & Construction Company of New York. Citizens of Cass County sought by injunction to prevent the funding of these bonds, but by legal maneuvering and collusion, a new set of bonds was issued secretly. Basically the outraged populace viewed this development as a sophisticated maneuver to benefit the holders of bonds that had become worthless by re-obligating the county to pay those same bonds. Three men who helped to perpetrate this swindle, including the county attorney and a judge of the county court, were shot and killed on April 24, 1872 while on board a Katy railroad spur between Bryson, Missouri and Paola, Kansas (in or near what is now known as Gunn City). Forty-one men were arrested and brought to trial for these killings, but there were no convictions. At the time of the shootings, a Republican newspaper, belonging to Mr. Porter J. Coston, in Harrisonville, Missouri, was burned by the same mob. [ 3 ]   [ 4 ]   The year before the Civil War, twelve cities in Missouri had population of approx. 2500 or more. Harrisonville ranked 37th with a population of 675. In 1863 the town was depopulated, and most of the buildings burned, the jail among them . Fort Harrisonville was a Union stronghold for a brief period in 1863 and provided protection for loyal Union families.

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

Contents       1   History   2   Geography   3   Demographics   4   Trivia   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   History   French Lick was originally a  French   trading post . A fortified ranger post was established near the springs in 1811. On an 1835 map of Indiana, the community was known as Salt Spring. The town was founded in 1857.   The  sulfur  springs were commercially exploited for medical benefits starting in 1840. By the later half of the 19th century, French Lick was famous in the United States as a  spa town . In the early 20th century it also featured  casinos  attracting celebrities like boxer  Joe Louis , composer  Irving Berlin  and gangster  Al Capone .   In 1943, the  Chicago Cubs  held  Spring Training  camp in French Lick. In order to conserve rail transport during  World War II , the 1943  Spring Training  was limited to an area east of the  Mississippi River  and north of the  Ohio River .  [ 3 ]   The  French Lick Resort Casino  was the focal point of most of the entertainment; the hotel remained open well after the casinos were closed down and the heyday of the town was well past. The resort closed for renovation in 2005.   Pluto Water , a best selling  laxative  of the first half of the 20th century, was bottled here. It was also home to a large  7-Up  bottling facility, which ceased operation in the mid-20th century.   Franklin D. Roosevelt  announced his intention to run for president at a National Governors' Convention held at the French Lick Springs Hotel.   Ever since his professional basketball career took off, the town has been best known for being the hometown of  NBA  great  Larry Bird . French Lick is also the  hometown  of former  Sacramento Kings   head coach   Jerry Reynolds , who currently works as the team's  color commentator  on its television broadcasts and is the Kings' director of player personnel.

The  Census Bureau  estimated its population at 81,913 in 2006, [ 3 ]  making it the sixth-largest city in the  Kansas City Metropolitan Area  and the sixth-largest city in Missouri. In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".

In 2006 CNN/Money and  Money  magazine ranked Lee's Summit 44th on its list of the 100 Best Cities to Live in the United States.

From the  1877 Illustrated Historical Atlas of Jackson Co. Missouri .       Founded as the ""Town of Strother"", by William B. Howard for his wife, Maria D. Strother (daughter of William D. Strother formally of  Bardstown, Kentucky ). Howard came to Jackson County in 1842 from  Kentucky , married Maria in 1844, and by 1850 he and Maria had 833 acres (3.37 km 2 ) and a homestead five miles (8 km) north of town. He was arrested for being a  Confederate  in October of 1862, near the beginning of the  Civil War , and after being paroled he took his family back to Kentucky for the duration of the war. After the war ended he returned and, knowing that the  Missouri Pacific Railroad  was surveying a route in the area, platted the town with 70 acres (280,000 m 2 ) in the fall of 1865. [ 5 ] [ 6 ]   In 1865 the town changed it's name for early settler Dr. Pleasant John Graves Lea, who moved to Jackson County in 1849, from  Bradley County, Tennessee . Lea was listed as the postmaster of Big Cedar in the 1855  United States Official Postal Guide . [ 7 ]  Dr. Lea was killed in August of 1862 by  Kansas Jayhawkers  (or Redlegs). [ 8 ]   When the surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad came through, the local people and the railroad wanted to name the town in Dr. Lea's honor. He had a farm on the highest point and near the path of the tracks, and his murder had taken place near the site of the proposed depot. So they chose the name of ""Lea's Summit"", the ""summit"" portion to reflect its relatively highest elevation on the Missouri Pacific Railroad between St. Louis and Kansas City. [ 5 ]  But they misspelled the name ""Lees Summit"" (with two ""e's""; ""Lee"" instead of ""Lea""; and leaving out the apostrophe) on a boxcar that was serving as a station and donated by the Missouri Pacific, [ 9 ]  then a sign next to the tracks, and finally in the printed time schedule for the railroad. [ 10 ]  Also the named was misspelled on the stone culvert near the station, on the side of the Missouri Pacific depot, but on the other side it was spelled correctly, accordingly the railroad used this spelling, as did travelers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   Others, those with Southern sympathies, claim that the town was named after famed Civil War General  Robert E. Lee  after Southerners began moving north into Missouri after the war. [ 5 ]  Attributed to a misquote in the  Louisville Journal , January 3, 1866. [ 10 ]   Since the name was already being circulated and published with two ""e's"", the town petitioned the state capitol and incorporated its name in 1868 as: ""Town of Lee's Summit"". [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   History          Lee's Summit in the early 20th century       In 1912, R.A. Long, the owner of a  lumber  company, began building his estate, named Longview Farm, on the western edge of the city and into part of  Kansas City . When complete, it had a mansion, five barns and 42 buildings in the 1,700 acres (6.9 km 2 ). The farm also had a church, Longview Chapel Christian Church, which was completed in 1915. It soon became internationally known as a showplace farm. Today, one of the horse barns is home to Longview Farm Elementary, and the site of Longview Community College. The church and mansion are on the  National Register of Historic Places . Other parts of the farm have been turned into Longview Lake, Longview Community College, and a development called New Longview. [ 5 ]   In March 2006, a new City Hall was dedicated replacing one that was considered insufficient for the size of the city. The downtown city hall construction had closed portions of 2nd street, Main Street, and Green Street. Currently, the city is working on a streetscaping project for downtown called ""Diggin It"".
