A  web hosting service  is a type of  Internet hosting service  that allows individuals and organizations to provide their own  website  accessible via the  World Wide Web . Web hosts are companies that provide space on a  server  they own for use by their clients as well as providing  Internet  connectivity, typically in a  data center . Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for servers they do not own to be located in their data center, called  colocation .

The most basic is  web page  and small-scale file hosting, where files can be  uploaded  via  File Transfer Protocol  (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web ""as is"" or with little processing. Many  Internet service providers  (ISPs) offer this service free to their subscribers. People can also obtain Web page hosting from other, alternative service providers. Personal web site hosting is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or cheap. Business web site hosting often has a higher expense.   Single page hosting is generally sufficient only for  personal web pages . A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides  database  support and application development platforms (e.g.  PHP ,  Java ,  Ruby on Rails ,  ColdFusion , and  ASP.NET ). These facilities allow the customers to write or install scripts for applications like  forums  and  content management . For  e-commerce ,  SSL  is also highly recommended.   The host may also provide an interface or  control panel  for managing the  Web server  and installing scripts as well as other services like e-mail. Some hosts specialize in certain software or services (e.g. e-commerce). They are commonly used by larger companies to outsource network infrastructure to a hosting company.     [ edit ]   Hosting reliability and uptime          Multiple racks of servers.       Hosting  uptime  refers to the percentage of time the host is accessible via the internet. Many providers state that they aim for a 99.9% uptime, but there may be server restarts and planned (or unplanned) maintenance in any hosting environment.   A common claim from the popular hosting providers is '99% or 99.9% server uptime' but this often refers only to a server being powered on and doesn't account for network downtime. Real downtime can potentially be larger than the percentage guaranteed by the provider. Many providers tie uptime and accessibility into their own service level agreement (SLA). SLAs sometimes include refunds or reduced costs if performance goals are not met.     [ edit ]   Types of hosting          A typical server ""rack,"" commonly seen in  colocation centres .       Internet hosting services can run  Web servers ; see  Internet hosting services .   Hosting services limited to the Web:     Free web hosting service :  is free, (sometimes) advertisement-supported web hosting, and is often limited when compared to paid hosting.  [ 1 ]       Shared web hosting service :  one's Web site is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few to hundreds or thousands. Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as  RAM  and the  CPU . The features available with this type of service can be quite extensive. A shared website may be hosted with a reseller.   Reseller web hosting :  allows clients to become web hosts themselves. Resellers could function, for individual domains, under any combination of these listed types of hosting, depending on who they are affiliated with as a provider. Resellers' accounts may vary tremendously in size: they may have their own virtual dedicated server to a colocated server. Many resellers provide a nearly identical service to their provider's shared hosting plan and provide the technical support themselves.   Virtual Dedicated Server :  dividing server resources into virtual servers, where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware. VPS will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many VPSs relationship, however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons, including the ability to move a container (Virtual Private Server) between servers. The users may have root access to their own virtual space. This is also known as a virtual private server or VPS. Customers are sometimes responsible for patching and maintaining the server.   Dedicated hosting service :  the user gets his or her own Web server and gains full control over it (root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, the user typically does not own the server. Another type of Dedicated hosting is Self-Managed or Unmanaged. This is usually the least expensive for Dedicated plans. The user has full administrative access to the box, which means the client is responsible for the security and maintenance of his own dedicated box.   Managed hosting service :  the user gets his or her own Web server but is not allowed full control over it (root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, they are allowed to manage their data via FTP or other remote management tools. The user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems. The user typically does not own the server. The server is leased to the client.   Colocation web hosting service :  similar to the dedicated web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and takes care of the server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of the web hosting service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client's machine, providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the client would have his own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes.   Clustered hosting :  having multiple servers hosting the same content for better resource utilization. Clustered Servers are a perfect solution for high-availability dedicated hosting, or creating a scalable web hosting solution. A cluster may separate web serving from database hosting capability.   Grid hosting  :  this form of distributed hosting is when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple nodes.   Home server :  usually a single machine placed in a private residence can be used to host one or more web sites from a usually consumer-grade  broadband  connection. These can be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs actively attempt to block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to  TCP  port 80 of the user's connection and by refusing to provide  static IP addresses . A common way to attain a reliable DNS hostname is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the IP address that a URL points to when the IP address changes.     Â  Some specific types of hosting provided by web host service providers:     File hosting service : hosts files, not web pages   Image hosting service   Video hosting service   Blog hosting service   One-click hosting   Shopping cart software       [ edit ]   Obtaining hosting   Web hosting is often provided as part of a general Internet access plan; there are many free and paid providers offering these services.   A customer needs to evaluate the requirements of the application to choose what kind of hosting to use. Such considerations include database server software, scripting software, and  operating system . Most hosting providers provide Linux-based web hosting which offers a wide range of different software. A typical configuration for a Linux server is the  LAMP  platform:  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP / Perl / Python . The webhosting client may want to have other services, such as email for their business domain, databases or multi-media services for  streaming media . A customer may also choose Windows as the hosting platform. The customer still can choose from PHP, Perl, and Python but may also use ASP .Net or Classic ASP.   Web hosting packages often include a  Web Content Management System , so the end-user doesn't have to worry about the more technical aspects. These Web Content Management systems are great for the average user, but for those who want more control over their website design, this feature may not be adequate.   Most modern desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) are also capable of running web server software, and thus can be used to host basic websites.   One may also search the Internet to find active webhosting message boards and forums that may provide feedback on what type of webhosting company may suit his/her needs. However some of these message boards and forums will require not only registration, but a paid subscription to be able to access the sections and sub forums with such information.

clueweb09-enwp02-30-17444	"                     Website          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          A  website  is a collection of  web pages , images, videos or other digital assets that is hosted on one or more  web servers , usually accessible via the  Internet .   A web page is a document, typically written in ( X ) HTML , that is almost always accessible via  HTTP , a protocol that transfers information from the  web server  to display in the user's  web browser .   All publicly accessible websites are seen collectively as constituting the "" World Wide Web "".   The pages of a website can usually be accessed from a common root  URL  called the  homepage , and usually reside on the same physical server. The URLs of the pages organize them into a hierarchy, although the  hyperlinks  between them control how the reader perceives the  overall structure  and how the  traffic  flows between the different parts of the site.   Some websites require a  subscription  to access some or all of their content. Examples of subscription sites include many business sites, parts of many  news  sites,  academic journal  sites, gaming sites,  message boards , Web-based  e-mail , services,  social networking  websites, and sites providing real-time  stock market  data. Because they require authentication to view the content they are technically an  Intranet  site.           Contents       1   History   2   Overview   3   Website styles     3.1   Static website   3.2   Dynamic website       4   Software systems     4.1   Content based sites   4.2   Product or service based sites       5   Spelling   6   Types of websites   7   Awards   8   See also   9   References   10   External links               [ edit ]   History   The World Wide Web was ""created"" in 1990 by CERN engineer,  Tim Berners-Lee . [ 1 ]  On 30 April 1993,  CERN  announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone. [ 2 ]   Before the introduction of HTML and HTTP other protocols such as  file transfer protocol  and the  gopher protocol  were used to retrieve individual files from a server. These protocols offer a simple directory structure which the user navigates and chooses files to download. Documents were most often presented as plain text files without formatting or were encoded in  word processor  formats.     [ edit ]   Overview   Organized by function a website may be     a  personal website   a  commercial website   a  government website   a  non-profit organization  website     It could be the work of an individual, a business or other organization, and is typically dedicated to some particular topic or purpose. Any website can contain a hyperlink to any other website, so the distinction between individual sites, as perceived by the user, may sometimes be blurred.   Websites are written in, or dynamically converted to, HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and are accessed using a  software  interface classified as an  user agent . Web pages can be viewed or otherwise accessed from a range of computer-based and Internet-enabled devices of various sizes, including desktop computers, laptops, PDAs and cell phones.   A website is  hosted  on a  computer system  known as a  web server , also called an HTTP server, and these terms can also refer to the  software  that runs on these systems and that retrieves and delivers the Web pages in response to requests from the website users.  Apache  is the most commonly used Web server software (according to  Netcraft  statistics) and  Microsoft 's  Internet Information Server  (IIS) is also commonly used.     [ edit ]   Website styles     [ edit ]   Static website       Main article:  static web page       A  static website  is one that has web pages stored on the server in the same form as the user will view them. It is primarily coded in  HTML  (Hyper-text Markup Language).   A static website is also called a  classic website , a  five-page website  or a  brochure website  because it simply presents pre-defined information to the user. It may include information about a company and its products and services via text, photos, Flash animation, audio/video and interactive menus and navigation.   This type of website usually displays the same information to all visitors, thus the information is static. Similar to handing out a printed brochure to customers or clients, a static website will generally provide consistent, standard information for an extended period of time. Although the website owner may make updates periodically, it is a manual process to edit the text, photos and other content and may require basic website design skills and software.   In summary, visitors are not able to control what information they receive via a static website, and must instead settle for whatever content the website owner has decided to offer at that time.   They are edited using four broad categories of software:     Text editors , such as  Notepad  or  TextEdit , where the HTML is manipulated directly within the editor program   WYSIWYG  offline editors, such as  Microsoft FrontPage  and  Adobe Dreamweaver  (previously Macromedia Dreamweaver), where the site is edited using a  GUI  interface and the underlying HTML is generated automatically by the editor software   WYSIWYG Online editors, where the any media rich online presentation like websites, widgets, intro, blogs etc. are created on a flash based platform.   Template-based editors, such as  Rapidweaver  and  iWeb , which allow users to quickly create and upload websites to a web server without having to know anything about HTML, as they just pick a suitable template from a palette and add pictures and text to it in a  DTP -like fashion without ever having to see any  HTML code .       [ edit ]   Dynamic website       Main article:  dynamic web page       A  dynamic website  is one that does not have web pages stored on the server in the same form as the user will view them. Instead, the web page content changes automatically and/or frequently based on certain criteria. It generally collates information on the hop each time a page is requested.   A website can be dynamic in one of two ways. The first is that the web page code is constructed dynamically, piece by piece. The second is that the web page content displayed varies based on certain criteria. The criteria may be pre-defined rules or may be based on variable user input.   The main purpose behind a dynamic site is that it is much simpler to maintain a few web pages plus a database than it is to build and update hundreds or thousands of individual web pages and links. In one way, a data-driven website is similar to a static site because the information that is presented on the site is still limited to what the website owner has allowed to be stored in the database (data entered by the owner and/or input by users and approved by the owner). The advantage is that there is usually a lot more information stored in a database and made available to users.   A dynamic website also describes its construction or how it is built, and more specifically refers to the code used to create a single web page. A  Dynamic web page  is generated on the fly by piecing together certain blocks of code, procedures or routines. A dynamically-generated web page would call various bits of information from a database and put them together in a pre-defined format to present the reader with a coherent page. It interacts with users in a variety of ways including by reading  cookies  recognizing users' previous history, session variables, server side variables etc., or by using direct interaction (form elements,  mouseovers , etc.). A site can display the current state of a dialogue between users, monitor a changing situation, or provide information in some way personalized to the requirements of the individual user.   Some countries, for example the U.K. and the U.S., have introduced legislation regarding  web accessibility     [ edit ]   Software systems   There are a wide range of software systems, such as  Java Server Pages  (JSP), the  PHP  and  Perl   programming languages ,  Active Server Pages  (ASP), YUMA and  ColdFusion  (CFM) that are available to generate dynamic Web systems and dynamic sites. Sites may also include content that is retrieved from one or more  databases  or by using  XML -based technologies such as  RSS .   Static content may also be dynamically generated either periodically, or if certain conditions for regeneration occur (cached) in order to avoid the performance loss of initiating the dynamic engine on a per-user or per-connection basis.   Plugins  are available to expand the features and abilities of Web browsers, which use them to show  active content,  such as  Flash ,  Shockwave  or  applets  written in  Java .  Dynamic HTML  also provides for user interactivity and realtime element updating within Web pages (i.e., pages don't have to be loaded or reloaded to effect any changes), mainly using the  DOM  and  JavaScript , support which is built-in to most modern Web browsers.   Turning a website into an income source is a common practice for web-developers and website owners. There are several methods for creating a website business which fall into two broad categories, as defined below.     [ edit ]   Content based sites   Some websites derive revenue by selling advertising space on the site (see  contextual ads ).     [ edit ]   Product or service based sites   Some websites derive revenue by offering products or services. In the case of  e-commerce  websites, the products or services may be purchased at the website itself, by entering credit card or other payment information into a payment form on the site. While most business websites serve as a shop window for existing  brick and mortar  businesses, it is increasingly the case that some websites are businesses in their own right; that is, the products they offer are only available for purchase on the web.   Websites occasionally derive income from a combination of these two practices. For example, a website such as an online auctions website may charge the users of its auction service to list an auction, but also display third-party advertisements on the site, from which it derives further income.     [ edit ]   Spelling   As noted above, there are several different spellings for this term. Although  website  and  web site  are commonly used (the former especially in British English), the  Associated Press Stylebook ,  Reuters ,  Microsoft , academia,  book publishing ,  The Chicago Manual of Style , and dictionaries such as  Merriam-Webster  use the two-word, initially capitalized spelling  Web site . This is because ""Web"" is not a general term but a shortened form of  World Wide Web . As with many newly created terms, it may take some time before a common spelling is finalized. (This controversy also applies to derivative terms such as Web master/webmaster and Web cam/webcam).   The  Canadian Oxford Dictionary  and the Canadian Press Stylebook list ""website"" and ""web page"" as the preferred spellings. The  Oxford English Dictionary  began using ""website"" as its standardized form in 2004. [ 3 ]   Bill Walsh , the copy chief of  The Washington Post's  national desk, and one of American English's foremost grammarians, argues for the two-word spelling with capital W in his books  Lapsing into a Comma  and  The Elephants of Style , and on his site, the Slot. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Types of websites   There are many varieties of Web sites, each specializing in a particular type of content or use, and they may be arbitrarily classified in any number of ways. A few such classifications might include: [ original research? ]     Affiliate : enabled  portal  that renders not only its custom  CMS  but also syndicated content from other content providers for an agreed fee. There are usually three relationship tiers.  Affiliate Agencies  (e.g.,  Commission Junction ),  Advertisers  (e.g.,  Ebay ) and consumer (e.g.,  Yahoo ).   Archive site : used to preserve valuable electronic content threatened with extinction. Two examples are:  Internet Archive , which since 1996 has preserved billions of old (and new) Web pages; and  Google Groups , which in early 2005 was archiving over 845,000,000 messages posted to  Usenet  news/discussion groups.   Blog  (or  web log ) site: sites generally used to post online diaries which may include discussion forums (e.g.,  blogger ,  Xanga ).   Content  site: sites whose business is the creation and distribution of original content (e.g.,  Slate ,  About.com ).   Corporate website : used to provide background information about a business, organization, or service.   Commerce site  (or eCommerce site): for purchasing goods, such as  Amazon.com ,  CSN Stores , and  Overstock.com .   Community site : a site where persons with similar interests communicate with each other, usually by  chat  or message boards, such as  MySpace  or  Facebook .   City Site : A site that shows information about a certain city or town and events that takes place in that town. Usually created by the city council or other ""movers and shakers"".       the same as those of geographic entities, such as cities and countries. For example, Richmond.com is the geodomain for  Richmond, Virginia .   Gripe site : a site devoted to the critique of a person, place, corporation, government, or institution.   Humor site : satirizes, parodies or otherwise exists solely to amuse.   Information site: contains content that is intended to inform visitors, but not necessarily for commercial purposes, such as:  RateMyProfessors.com , Free Internet Lexicon and Encyclopedia. Most government, educational and non-profit institutions have an informational site.   Java applet  site: contains software to run over the Web as a  Web application .   Mirror  site: A complete reproduction of a website.   News site : similar to an information site, but dedicated to dispensing news and commentary.   Personal homepage : run by an individual or a small group (such as a family) that contains information or any content that the individual wishes to include. These are usually uploaded using a web hosting service such as  Geocities .   Phish site: a website created to fraudulently acquire  sensitive information , such as passwords and  credit card  details, by masquerading as a trustworthy person or business (such as  Social Security Administration ,  PayPal ) in an  electronic communication  (see  Phishing ).   Political site: A site on which people may voice political views.   Porn site  - a site that shows sexually explicit content for enjoyment and relaxation, most likely in the form of an internet gallery, dating site, blog, or video sharing.   Rating site : A site on which people can praise or disparage what is featured.   Review site : A site on which people can post reviews for products or services.   School site : a site on which teachers, students, or administrators can post information about current events at or involving their school. U.S. websites generally uses k12 in the URL such as kearney.k12.mo.us.   Video sharing : A site that enables user to upload videos, such as  YouTube  and  Google Video .   Search engine  site: a site that provides general information and is intended as a gateway or lookup for other sites. A pure example is  Google , and the most widely known extended type is  Yahoo! .   Shock site : includes  images  or other material that is intended to be offensive to most viewers (e.g.  rotten.com ).   Warez : a site designed to host and let users download copyrighted materials illegally.   Web portal : a site that provides a starting point or a gateway to other resources on the Internet or an intranet.   Wiki  site: a site which users collaboratively edit (such as  Wikipedia  and  Wikihow ).     Some websites may be included in one or more of these categories. For example, a business website may promote the business's products, but may also host informative documents, such as  white papers . There are also numerous sub-categories to the ones listed above. For example, a  porn  site is a specific type of eCommerce site or business site (that is, it is trying to sell memberships for access to its site). A  fan site  may be a dedication from the owner to a particular  celebrity .   Websites are constrained by architectural limits (e.g., the computing power dedicated to the website). Very large websites, such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google employ many servers and  load balancing  equipment such as  Cisco  Content Services  Switches  to distribute visitor loads over multiple computers at multiple locations.   In January 2007,  Netcraft , an  Internet monitoring  company that has tracked Web growth since 1995, reported that there were 106,875,138 Web sites with domain names and content on them in 2007, compared to just 18,000 Web sites in August 1995.     [ edit ]   Awards   The  Webby Awards  are a set of awards presented to the world's best websites, a concept pioneered by  Best of the Web  in 1994.

(March 2008)                 Types of  Internet hosting service           Full-featured hosting services    Virtual private server   Dedicated hosting   Colocation centre       Web hosting     Free hosting   Shared hosting   Clustered hosting   Reseller hosting   FFmpeg hosting   Application-specific    Blog hosting   Guild hosting   Image hosting   Video hosting   Wiki farms   Application hosting   Social network hosting           File hosting   Remote backup service   Game server hosting   DNS hosting   E-mail hosting                  An example of ""rack mounted"" servers.       A  web hosting service  is a type of  Internet hosting service  that allows individuals and organizations to provide their own  website  accessible via the  World Wide Web . Web hosts are companies that provide space on a  server  they own for use by their clients as well as providing  Internet  connectivity, typically in a  data center . Web hosts can also provide data center space and connectivity to the Internet for servers they do not own to be located in their data center, called  colocation .           Contents       1   Service scope   2   Hosting reliability and uptime   3   Types of hosting   4   Obtaining hosting   5   See also   6   References               [ edit ]   Service scope   The scope of hosting services varies widely. The most basic is  web page  and small-scale file hosting, where files can be  uploaded  via  File Transfer Protocol  (FTP) or a Web interface. The files are usually delivered to the Web ""as is"" or with little processing. Many  Internet service providers  (ISPs) offer this service free to their subscribers. People can also obtain Web page hosting from other, alternative service providers. Personal web site hosting is typically free, advertisement-sponsored, or cheap. Business web site hosting often has a higher expense.   Single page hosting is generally sufficient only for  personal web pages . A complex site calls for a more comprehensive package that provides  database  support and application development platforms (e.g.  PHP ,  Java ,  Ruby on Rails ,  ColdFusion , and  ASP.NET ). These facilities allow the customers to write or install scripts for applications like  forums  and  content management . For  e-commerce ,  SSL  is also highly recommended.   The host may also provide an interface or  control panel  for managing the  Web server  and installing scripts as well as other services like e-mail. Some hosts specialize in certain software or services (e.g. e-commerce). They are commonly used by larger companies to outsource network infrastructure to a hosting company.     [ edit ]   Hosting reliability and uptime          Multiple racks of servers.       Hosting  uptime  refers to the percentage of time the host is accessible via the internet. Many providers state that they aim for a 99.9% uptime, but there may be server restarts and planned (or unplanned) maintenance in any hosting environment.   A common claim from the popular hosting providers is '99% or 99.9% server uptime' but this often refers only to a server being powered on and doesn't account for network downtime. Real downtime can potentially be larger than the percentage guaranteed by the provider. Many providers tie uptime and accessibility into their own service level agreement (SLA). SLAs sometimes include refunds or reduced costs if performance goals are not met.     [ edit ]   Types of hosting          A typical server ""rack,"" commonly seen in  colocation centres .       Internet hosting services can run  Web servers ; see  Internet hosting services .   Hosting services limited to the Web:     Free web hosting service :  is free, (sometimes) advertisement-supported web hosting, and is often limited when compared to paid hosting.  [ 1 ]       Shared web hosting service :  one's Web site is placed on the same server as many other sites, ranging from a few to hundreds or thousands. Typically, all domains may share a common pool of server resources, such as  RAM  and the  CPU . The features available with this type of service can be quite extensive. A shared website may be hosted with a reseller.   Reseller web hosting :  allows clients to become web hosts themselves. Resellers could function, for individual domains, under any combination of these listed types of hosting, depending on who they are affiliated with as a provider. Resellers' accounts may vary tremendously in size: they may have their own virtual dedicated server to a colocated server. Many resellers provide a nearly identical service to their provider's shared hosting plan and provide the technical support themselves.   Virtual Dedicated Server :  dividing server resources into virtual servers, where resources can be allocated in a way that does not directly reflect the underlying hardware. VPS will often be allocated resources based on a one server to many VPSs relationship, however virtualisation may be done for a number of reasons, including the ability to move a container (Virtual Private Server) between servers. The users may have root access to their own virtual space. This is also known as a virtual private server or VPS. Customers are sometimes responsible for patching and maintaining the server.   Dedicated hosting service :  the user gets his or her own Web server and gains full control over it (root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, the user typically does not own the server. Another type of Dedicated hosting is Self-Managed or Unmanaged. This is usually the least expensive for Dedicated plans. The user has full administrative access to the box, which means the client is responsible for the security and maintenance of his own dedicated box.   Managed hosting service :  the user gets his or her own Web server but is not allowed full control over it (root access for Linux/administrator access for Windows); however, they are allowed to manage their data via FTP or other remote management tools. The user is disallowed full control so that the provider can guarantee quality of service by not allowing the user to modify the server or potentially create configuration problems. The user typically does not own the server. The server is leased to the client.   Colocation web hosting service :  similar to the dedicated web hosting service, but the user owns the colo server; the hosting company provides physical space that the server takes up and takes care of the server. This is the most powerful and expensive type of the web hosting service. In most cases, the colocation provider may provide little to no support directly for their client's machine, providing only the electrical, Internet access, and storage facilities for the server. In most cases for colo, the client would have his own administrator visit the data center on site to do any hardware upgrades or changes.   Clustered hosting :  having multiple servers hosting the same content for better resource utilization. Clustered Servers are a perfect solution for high-availability dedicated hosting, or creating a scalable web hosting solution. A cluster may separate web serving from database hosting capability.   Grid hosting  :  this form of distributed hosting is when a server cluster acts like a grid and is composed of multiple nodes.   Home server :  usually a single machine placed in a private residence can be used to host one or more web sites from a usually consumer-grade  broadband  connection. These can be purpose-built machines or more commonly old PCs. Some ISPs actively attempt to block home servers by disallowing incoming requests to  TCP  port 80 of the user's connection and by refusing to provide  static IP addresses . A common way to attain a reliable DNS hostname is by creating an account with a dynamic DNS service. A dynamic DNS service will automatically change the IP address that a URL points to when the IP address changes.     Â  Some specific types of hosting provided by web host service providers:     File hosting service : hosts files, not web pages   Image hosting service   Video hosting service   Blog hosting service   One-click hosting   Shopping cart software       [ edit ]   Obtaining hosting   Web hosting is often provided as part of a general Internet access plan; there are many free and paid providers offering these services.   A customer needs to evaluate the requirements of the application to choose what kind of hosting to use. Such considerations include database server software, scripting software, and  operating system . Most hosting providers provide Linux-based web hosting which offers a wide range of different software. A typical configuration for a Linux server is the  LAMP  platform:  Linux ,  Apache ,  MySQL , and  PHP / Perl / Python . The webhosting client may want to have other services, such as email for their business domain, databases or multi-media services for  streaming media . A customer may also choose Windows as the hosting platform. The customer still can choose from PHP, Perl, and Python but may also use ASP .Net or Classic ASP.   Web hosting packages often include a  Web Content Management System , so the end-user doesn't have to worry about the more technical aspects. These Web Content Management systems are great for the average user, but for those who want more control over their website design, this feature may not be adequate.   Most modern desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) are also capable of running web server software, and thus can be used to host basic websites.   One may also search the Internet to find active webhosting message boards and forums that may provide feedback on what type of webhosting company may suit his/her needs. However some of these message boards and forums will require not only registration, but a paid subscription to be able to access the sections and sub forums with such information.
