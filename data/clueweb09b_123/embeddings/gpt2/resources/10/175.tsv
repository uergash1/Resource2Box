GX271-36-1182114	"Chapter III  Components of Florida's Commercial Intracoastal and Navigable Waterway System Florida has the longest coastline of all the states excepting Alaska. The coastline is about 1,350 miles long, but, including all indentations and islands, it measures 8,426 miles. The Atlantic Coast has few such indentations. There is an outer arc of sandy barrier islands, many of which have been developed as tourist resorts. Behind the beaches lie long, narrow saltwater lagoons. The longest such lagoon is the Indian River near Cape Canaveral; it is sheltered from the ocean by the offshore barrier islands and forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.  The Gulf Coast, or western coastline of the peninsula, is deeply indented. Mangrove swamps and ecologically sensitive areas abound; particularly from Naples, south. A number of sandy barrier islands extend from Fort Myers to Tarpon Springs. The islands reappear farther north, just west of Apalachee Bay, and they continue westward to the Alabama state line. Behind them lie extensive stretches of swamp and marsh. The Tampa Bay region forms the best commercially navigable harbor on the Gulf Coast as evidenced by the three major seaports of Tampa, Manatee, and St. Petersburg being located on this bay. It is protected from the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico by a long line of offshore sand bars and islands. Other Gulf Coast harbors similarly protected behind the barrier islands include Pensacola Bay, Apalachicola Bay, Saint Joseph's Bay, West Bay, and Escambia Bay.  Florida's navigable waterway system for commercial purposes can easily be categorized by three major components: 1) the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway inshore system, 2) The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway inshore and offshore system, and 3) the navigable portions of the State's inland river systems. Given the State of Florida's extensive shoreline, there are numerous points of ingress and egress used by recreational boaters and fishermen, but for commercial navigable purposes, the system in use today is relatively easy to identify. From the western panhandle to the eastern Atlantic shore, the following six major navigable waterways comprise the core of Florida's present day commercial navigable inland waterway systems.  3-1   1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

South Dock - Port of Panama City, Fl. March 2003  3-2   The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Inshore System(AIWW) Originally known as the ""Florida Coastline Canal"" and initially constructed by a private company known as the Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company in 1881, the waterway connects the Saint Johns River, Matanzas River and Indian Rivers through Lake Worth with the waters of Biscayne Bay. The original draft design was 3 feet mean low water and 25 feet wide. However in 1889 the Florida Legislature, through Chapter 3995 Laws of Florida, required canals constructed by the Company to be not less than 50 feet wide and not less than 5 feet deep at mean low water for the entire distance of the project. Approximately 1 million acres of public lands were granted by the State of Florida to the Company to aid in completing the requirements for the full length of the Canal. The total cost of the Canal through 1914 was estimated to be $3.5 million dollars. Problems with shoaling and continuing maintenance caused the Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company to go bankrupt in 1923. Public outcry for public acquisition and responsibility for its continued maintenance and upkeep prompted Congress in 1920 to pass the River and Harbors Act requiring the U.S. Army to investigate the economics and feasibility of assuming public federal ownership of the Canal. Six years later, a report from the Secretary of War supported the economic feasibility of maintaining the waterway, conditioned on the lands and resources associated with it being deeded free of charge to the United States Government and that suitable spoil disposal locations must be identified and provided by local interests in order for the Federal Government to assume maintenance responsibilities.  Exhibit 3-1  3-3   The Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Inshore System from Nassau County to its terminus in Dade County traverses a distance of 365 nautical miles; including tributaries of the system (some navigable, some not) an additional 340 miles for a total of 715 miles (Exhibit 3-1). The Florida portion of the total system, which is federally maintained from New Jersey to the Biscayne Bay Canal in Miami-Dade County ( a total of 1,263 miles), supports 70 Federal Navigation Projects, over 105,000,000 annual tons of cargo, 800,000+ registered recreational vessels, over 124,000 commercially related jobs, and 6,500 recreational marine related businesses. Personal wages directly associated with waterway activities total over $2.6 billion dollars and property owned/ maintained by the Florida Inland Navigation District totals in excess of $38.4 billion dollars ( Source: Florida Inland Navigation District, unpublished data).  are estimated to increase approximately 18% from existing numbers. The District indicates that $7.8 million dollars per year dedicated from any source, would satisfy the proper maintenance of the entire Jacksonville to Miami reach of the waterway to its design depth of 12 feet for commercial navigation.  The Florida Inland Navigation District estimates that with neglect and cessation of maintenance dredging to the system (return to a 3 foot controlling depth) the economic contribution of the waterway would be adversely reduced by almost 54% from the numbers previously cited. Likewise, if maintenance dredging expenditures were increased to maintain the design depth of 10-12 feet and 125 wide, economic contributions  3-4   Chapter III  The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Inshore and Offshore System(GIWW) Exhibit 3-2  The middle 1930s saw the federally authorized Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway System and the connecting of the Okeechobee Waterway nearing completion. With the logical connection of the east coast commercial trade routes to the west coast of Florida at Ft. Myers, commercial barge and short shipping operations began pressuring the political establishment for an extended protected passage northward to major consumption and distribution points along the United States Gulf Coast. The population centers of Tampa, St. Petersburg, Sarasota, Ft. Myers, Clearwater, Bradenton and Tarpon Springs all supported and pushed for federal and state improvements to the west coast trade route; the purpose being to enhance commercial activity and to support jobs and economic development. The region produced (and still does) many perishable items including citrus, vegetables, livestock, lumber products, fish, lime and phosphate rock.  In 1935, Congress authorized the first examination and survey for an intracoastal waterway from the Caloosahatchee River north to Apalachicola Bay. On August 30th of that year the Rivers and Harbors Act was passed to provide a waterway exit to the north for craft using the Okeechobee Cross Florida Canal. Between the Caloosahatchee River 148 miles north to the Anclote River, a chain of inlets and passes between barrier islands provides a relatively protected ""inside passage"" of the Gulf Coast waterway system. From the Anclote River North, however, the Waterway is fully exposed to the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Because these waters are relatively shallow and gradually deepen for many miles wave action is, in most cases,  3-5   dissipated far offshore allowing for relatively safe passage of smaller shallow draft commercial or recreational vessels during calm weather conditions. Inclement weather affords refuge for these vessels in the Homosassa, Crystal, and Withlacoochee Rivers.  constructed; a channel 12 feet deep and 150 feet wide was authorized in 1968 from St. Marks to Tampa Bay but has never been constructed due to environmental concerns. Because of these environmental concerns, the State has to-date elected not to sponsor this remaining segment from Carrabelle to Tampa Bay.  Several smaller projects were conducted on the waterway between 1935 and the early 1940s. The Second World War delayed funding for Florida's Gulf Intracoastal Waterway until 1945 when Congress authorized the west coast system and included a provision that local interests must furnish all lands needed for the project. The West Coast Inland Navigation District was created by the Florida Legislature in 1947 with power to levy taxes for land procurement. Modifying federal legislation in 1948, 1950, 1954, 1957 and 1959 resolved terms of local compliance and in June 1960 dredging began and was completed in 1967 of the 151 mile western leg of the waterway . The entire system, some 300 miles, from the Caloosahatchee River to Carrabelle, Florida was essentially complete. Within two years the Florida Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (Exhibit 3-2) carried 418, 268 tons of freight-more than twice the tonnage estimated when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers first recommended the project. Commerce has risen steadily totaling 1,568,618 tons in 1978 and 2,000,000 + tons in 2002. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway segment between Carrabelle and St. Marks, authorized in 1937 still has not been  Vessels continue to ply the open waters of the Gulf south of St. Marks to Tampa.  The waterway is subdivided into five Corps of Engineers districts responsible for Waterway maintenance and operation of navigable structures. The Galveston District oversees the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from the Mexican border to Louisiana; the New Orleans District encompasses it throughout Louisiana, the Vicksburg District touches the waterway, the Mobile District begins in Western Mississippi and ends just east of Tallahassee, Florida; and the Jacksonville District covers the Waterway from the latter point over to the vicinity of Fort Myers.  Since the completion of the waterway in 1967, it has become a major artery of commerce for the State of Florida. Millions of tons of cargo are transported annually on the waterway. Principal commodities include oil, phosphate, construction, and industrial materials (Appendix A). The major ports served include: Port Boca Grande on Gasparilla Island; Port Manatee on Tampa Bay; and Port Tampa on Old Tampa Bay.  3-6   The ApalachicolaChattahoochee-Flint River System (ACF) The Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint River System (Exhibit 3-3) provides a link from the upper Chattahoochee and Flint River basins to the Gulf of Mexico at Apalachicola Bay, Florida. The system is linked to the nation's inland navigation system by the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. It consists of a channel 9 feet deep and 100 feet wide from the mouth of the Apalachicola River to the head of navigation at Columbus, Georgia (for the Chattahoochee River) and at Bainbridge, Georgia (for the Flint River). The total waterway distance is 290 miles with a lift of 190 feet accomplished by three locks and dams, the Walter F. George Lock, the George W. Andrews Lock, and the Woodruff Lock and Dam located at the north end of Lake Seminole in Georgia.  River to Bainbridge, Georgia. Extreme  drought and recent water management issues involving  Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, may affect the future navigable aspects for commercial navigation.  Exhibit 3-3  In 1953, a resolution was adopted by the House Committee on Public Works for the development of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint River Basin. Projects were authorized for navigation  improvements, power generation and stream flow regulation. Recreational facilities at Walter F. George Lake, George W. Andrews Lake, and Lake Seminole were authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944. All three lakes have been operational since 1963.  The United States Army Corps of Engineers has been improving navigation along the Apalachicola River since the early 1800's. Between 1828 and 1831, the Corps removed obstructions from the river to provide for shallow draft vessel traffic. In 1874, the project was modified to provide for improvements of the Apalachicola River to secure a channel 6 feet deep at mean low water and 100 feet wide throughout its length. Passage of the 1945 River and Harbors Act authorized a 9 foot by 100 foot channel to be constructed on the Apalachicola and Chattahoochee River segments to Columbus Georgia and on the Flint  The Jim Woodruff Dam was the initial project of the authorized federal plan for improvement of the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint River System. It is located on the Apalachicola River about 1000 feet below the confluence of the Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers which unite to form the Apalachicola River, and is at the Georgia-Florida state line. It is  approximately 3,200 feet up stream from the U.S. Highway 90 Bridge over the Apalachicola River and is visible from the bridge. The dam is accessible by road and is located approximately 1 mile northwest of Chattahoochee, Florida.  3-7   The Okeechobee Waterway System Lake Okeechobee is Florida's largest freshwater lake and the second largest freshwater lake in the United States. There are presently ten recreational areas located along the east/ west waterway which offers excellent boating, fishing, and waterfowl hunting. This convenient link with the Florida coast also offers recreational boaters protected waters, anchorages, and numerous shore stop opportunities. Covering 730 square miles, its name is derived from the Seminole Indian words meaning ""big water."" The Lake's average depth is 10 feet and it provides drinking water for over 6 million Florida residents and serves as a source of irrigation for a $1.5 billion dollar a year agricultural industry that produces sugar cane, winter vegetables, citrus, and rice. In 1999, it carried 850,000 short tons of commercial cargo, mostly distillate and residual fuel oils destined for Florida Power and Light power plants in the Ft. Myers area ;  these shipments represented over 96% of total shipments. This total has fallen somewhat to about 728,000 short tons for year 2000 (last availiable reporting year).  The Okeechobee Waterway (Exhibit 3-4) running from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Inlet near Ft. Myers some 152 miles to the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway Inlet near Stuart, has 5 lock systems (WP Franklin, Ortona Lock, Moore Haven Lock, Port Mayaca Lock, and St. Lucie Lock) used to raise and lower recreational boat traffic to and from the Lake. There are 14 separate clearance restriction locations along the waterway with controlling maximum clearance at 14.5 feet through the eastern St. Lucie Canal to the Atlantic, these restrictions greatly affect use of the waterway for commercial navigation purposes.  In 1847, two years after Florida was granted statehood, a plan was proposed to reclaim the Everglades and attract thousands of settlers to South Florida. Promoters believed that to do this was only a matter of dredging a few canals to drain off excessive water. It would be 30 more years before this concept was actually attempted. During this time, the Kissimmee River was connected to the Gulf of Mexico via Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee River.  In the early 1900's, Florida's Legislature responded  Exhibit 3-4  to public demands for better flood control in the  3-8   region by creating the Everglades Drainage District. Unfortunately, in 1926 and again in 1928, devastating hurricanes hit the region driving water over the Lake dikes and flooding the region claiming over 3,200  The Miami River The 5.5 mile Miami River has a long and colorful history evolving over thousands of years from a tidal channel into a freshwater spring fed stream that carried water from the Everglades to Biscayne Bay. It is the oldest natural landmark in Southeast Florida. The word ""Miami"" is an Indian word meaning ""sweet water"". The region from the river's headwaters near today's Northwest 27th Avenue to Biscayne Bay(at that time, a natural spring) was inhabited by Tequesta Indians and was a major trading area during the 1500's and 1600's for Indian and Spanish explorers.  lives. To prevent reoccurrence, the Florida Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District which was authorized to cooperate with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in flood control project development. A long-term system was designed for flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and wildlife preservation.  As the City of Miami grew in the early 1900's, the Miami River quickly became a major transportation artery in the development of the City. The Florida East Coast Railway built warehouses and docks to serve the demand for growing trade. Winter  vegetables came into the City by boat from Biscayne Bay and were loaded on railroad freight cars for shipment north. Boat building and marine repair businesses began and flourished during this period and some remain today.  Today, the Lake and the Waterway are part of a complex water management system including the Cross-State Canal, known as the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. The project covers 16,000 square miles beginning just south of Orlando and extending southward through the Kissimmee River Basin to the Everglades National Park to Florida Bay. Responsibility for its continued maintance rests with the Florida Inland Navigation District.  From 1903 to 1933, the River was lengthened and widened by the federal government and the once clear rapids stopped in 1909 when the Miami Canal was built. When the Miami Canal construction began, the water table dropped sharply, and Everglades muck slid into the River's once clear spring fed waters. By the 1930's the River was in its present  3-9   configuration as a navigable 5.5 mile channel where the Miami Canal connects south to Biscayne Bay.  impeding economic growth along the river. The river has not been dredged since 1933, although efforts are currently ongoing to correct this problem.  World War II saw the River become a center of industrial and heavy marine use, when it became a major construction location for wartime PT boats. The Miami River is the fourth largest port development area in the State of Florida, with an estimated $4 billion in trade annually as reported by In the 1960's several local civic organizations and political leaders undertook studies to document the neglect and need to improve the river conditions. Code enforcement crackdowns by the City cleaned up part of the river area; In the period 1976-1986, the Miami River Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance recognized the river as a special district. contiguous businesses, owners and operators along the river. Sediment buildup severely impacts  shipping commerce, as vessels must ""lighter"" their loads (reduce their mean low water drafts) in order to traverse the river. Larger vessels can only traverse the river during periods of high tide. The Commission believes that dredging the river will: improve the marine environment of the river and Biscayne Bay;  In January 1998, the Miami River Study Commission publicly urged a forceful, community wide effort to clean up the river and bring it to its potential. The Miami River Commission was formed and began to fulfill its mission to unite all governmental agencies, businesses and residents to speak with one voice on river issues, and to develop coordinated plans, priorities, programs, projects and budgets that will substantially improve the River. The Commission is to act as the principle advocate and watchdog to ensure that river projects are funded and implemented in a proper and timely manner. The major impediment to enhanced commercial use of the river and a priority of the Commission is to dredge the entire 5.5 mile commercial zone to remove the build up of contaminated sediments that are damaging the marine environment and significantly  improve the marine industry allowing ships to fully load and improve the economy of the region; and act as a catalyst for riverside development and neighborhood improvement. To date, the  Commission has been authorized and appropriated a total of $6,800,000.00 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the required $40,000,000.00 project.  3-10   The Saint Johns River System The Saint Johns River System in East Central Florida is 285 miles long beginning north of Lake Okeechobee and meandering north to Jacksonville where it turns abruptly east and enters the Atlantic Ocean some 28 miles away (Exhibit 3-5). It is Florida's longest river. The river system passes through eight lakes and receives many tributaries; the Oklawaha River being the most important. The dredged river system is maintained under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is navigable for 170 miles upstream. The lower one-third of the river forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway System. The water hyacinth was accidentally introduced to the region in the 1880s, and it quickly spread throughout the upper reaches of the river system.  In the nineteenth century, the Saint Johns River was a busy commercial waterway for the greater part of its course. Now,  Over the next few years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in cooperation with the Jacksonville Port Authority, will be deepening more than 14 miles of the Saint Johns River in proximity to the port using the beach quality dredge material to improve Jacksonville beaches. The project will involve both channel and harbor deepening from 38 feet in key locations to over 40+ feet. The project is aimed at increasing the capacity and ability of cargo vessels to call at Jacksonville bringing additional commerce and jobs to the region. This project is currently estimated at $31,000,000.00 with the federal government to contribute $5,300,000.00 and local government and the state the rest. It is estimated that it will take approximately two years to complete.  Exhibit 3-5  however, dense mats of water hyacinth render commercial navigation almost impossible on the river's upper course.  3-11"

Osceola was one of the leaders of the Seminole Indians during the Second Seminole War with the United States in the 1830s. Although originally from Alabama, Osceola and his Creek Indian mother moved to Florida, which was the homeland of the Seminole Indians. When white settlers began moving into the state, they wanted the Seminoles to move to Indian territories west of the Mississippi River. Osceola led a group of Seminoles opposed to relocation. Other Seminoles, however, chose to move rather than fight. By using tactics unfamiliar to the white settlers and by hiding in the Everglades, Osceola and some of the Seminoles were successfully able to resist the United States government's attempts to remove them from Florida for a time. It was not until the capture of Osceola and his death in 1838 at Fort Moultrie in South Carolina that the Seminoles were forced from their homeland.                             page 1 of 1                                                          Home     >   Explore the States   >   Florida   >   Osceola       Site Map

Even so, many of the cities and towns in Florida are very new, especially in the central and south sections. Habitation by people in the central and south counties of Florida was uncomfortable and unhealthy before the advent of air conditioning and mosquito control.  Miami is arguably the best known city in Florida, and it has experienced boom and bust throughout its short history. It has known the Spanish-American War, Henry Flagler and his railroad, the Roaring Twenties, the Depression, World War II, segregation and civil unrest in the 50s and 60s, the Cuban missile crisis and the Mariel Boat Lift, and the tremendous influx of Latin American immigrants in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. The character of Miami has changed dramatically through all this time, and today it is a vibrant, multi-cultural city with a pervasive Latin flavor of its many Cuban-American and Latin American residents.  The following narrative is taken from the  Historical Museum of Southern Florida 's web site:             ""Hundreds of years earlier, before Christopher Columbus (Cristobal Colon) discovered the New World, the Tequesta Indians lived here. The first to appreciate South Florida's mild climate, the Tequestans lived simply. Abundant food supplied from the land and sea made agricultural activities unnecessary. In 1566, the Tequesta settlement was visited by Pedro Menendez de Aviles, his men, and Brother Francisco Villareal. One year earlier, Menendez had founded St. Augustine, the oldest city in the United States, and now came to South Florida to establish a Jesuit mission. Within a few years it was abandoned and another attempt to Christianize the Tequestans was not made until 1743. That effort was also short-lived.         During the more than two centuries that Florida was controlled by Spain, the Tequestans and other Prehistoric Indians of Florida were decimated by European diseases and warfare. The lands they vacated attracted people from several of the Creek tribes in Georgia and Alabama who had entered Florida as early as 1704. Collectively, they became known as Seminoles, and during the nineteenth century they would engage in a series of bloody wars against the United States partly to defend their right to live in Florida. After the conclusion of the Third Seminole War in 1858, the few hundred Indians remaining in the state lived in the Everglades.         The first permanent white settlers in the Miami area arrived in the early 1800s. During the decades that followed, a wide variety of individuals left their mark on the history of this area. In the 1830s, statesman Richard Fitzpatrick from South Carolina operated, with slave labor, a successful plantation on the Miami River. He cultivated sugar cane, bananas, corn and tropical fruit. Fitzpatrick was driven from his plantation by the Seminole Indians.  Major William S. Harney , in command at Fort Dallas which was located on Fitzpatrick's Plantation on the north bank of the Miami River, led several raids against the Indians during the Second Seminole War (1835-1842).""   Fort Dallas was one of a series of forts established by the U.S. Government during the Seminole Wars from 1816-1818, 1835-1842, and 1855-1858. The first weather observations taken in what is now the Miami area were at Fort Dallas during the Second Seminole War. Temperature records, with many breaks, are available from 1839 to 1855 from the Fort Dallas site (also called ""Biscayne Bay"") near present day 2 nd  Avenue SE and 4 th  Street SE. Temperatures and rainfall are available from the Fort Dallas site from 1855 to 1858 with many breaks.     Fort Dallas Slave Quarters, now located in Lummus Park, downtown Miami   U.S. Army Assistant Surgeons at Fort Dallas kept meteorological records during the Second and Third Seminole Wars       from the Battle of Olustee, Fla. (Baker County),   1864, web page   The War Between the States had little effect on South Florida outside of Key West, because of the very few residents and the lack of any strategic reason for Confederates to defend the area. Fort Dallas likely remained in Union hands throughout the war and probably served as a base for ships participating in the naval blockade of the Confederacy. In 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant signed a joint resolution of Congress establishing a weather service within the Army. Observations were taken at 22 sites by the Army Signal Corps and the word 'forecast' was first used. An Army Signal Corps weather observation site was established at Punta Rassa (near Fort Myers) on the west coast, and later at Jupiter in Palm Beach County on the east coast. Meteorological observations taken in the Miami area between 1870 and 1880 were called 'Biscayne Bay' and seem to have been taken at least part of the time on Key Biscayne where a lighthouse was located.  In 1880, the Fort Dallas/Biscayne Bay temperature and rainfall records ended. In 1890, at the request of President Benjamin Harrison, Congress created the Weather Bureau within the Department of Agriculture. On December 29, 1894, the State of Florida experienced its worst freeze since 1835 and another severe freeze occurred on February 7, 1895. Partially as a result of those two severe freezes which were reportedly much less severe near Biscayne Bay,  Henry Flagler  decided to extend his railroad south from West Palm Beach to the northern shore of the Miami River and build a luxury hotel there.  Unfortunately, no meteorological records were kept in the Miami area again until September, 1895, when a new station was established at Lemon City (again possibly as a result of those two freezes farther north in Florida). Lemon City was a town located near the present day intersection of NE 2 nd  Avenue and 60 th  Street. From Larry Wiggins' study entitled ""The Birth of Miami"" available on the Historical Museum of Southern Florida's web site:             The Miami area, in the years leading up to the railroad's arrival, was better known as ""Biscayne Bay Country."" The only overland transportation to the area was by a hack (or stagecoach) line that ran from Lantana on them southern end of Lake Worth to Lemon City on Biscayne Bay. The few published accounts from that period describe the area as a wilderness that held much promise. Lying five miles north of the Miami River, Lemon City could boast of only fifteen buildings in 1893. However, many homesteaders had settled on land up to five miles away from the core of the settlements. One of these buildings was a new hotel that could accommodate twenty-five to thirty guests. Two miles south were several people living in Buena Vista. ""Cocoanut Grove"" (as it was spelled then) sat ... south of the Miami River; it contained twenty-eight buildings ""of a very neat and tasteful character,"" two large stores doing an ""immense business,"" and a hotel run by Charles and Isabella Peacock. Cutler, eight miles south of Cocoanut Grove, also contained a few settlers.     Lemon City Post Office Building, corner of NE 2nd Avenue and 60th St.  Miami area records likely kept behind this building 1895-1900   The Lemon City site recorded temperatures and rainfall for five years from September, 1895 to April, 1900. It was during this time that the Biscayne Bay area experienced the first ""boom"" in anticipation of the Flagler railroad. The town of Miami was set out on land previously owned by Julia Tuttle and William Brickell on the north and south sides of the Miami River, respectively. The railroad tracks reached Lemon City on April 3, 1896 and the new town of Miami (7 miles to the south) only 4 days later on April 7.  As the town of Miami rapidly began to develop, the economic importance of spreading information about the mild climate undoubtedly influenced the establishment of a cooperative temperature and rainfall recording site at 131 SE 1 st  Street, now near the heart of downtown, in December, 1900. Instruments remained there until May, 1911 when the city's first Weather Bureau Office (WBO) was established.  The following narrative is taken from Local Climatological Summary for 1949:             In June, 1911, a first order Weather Bureau station was opened in the Bank of Bay Biscayne Building, at the northwest corner of Miami Avenue and Flagler Street. Instruments were exposed on the roof. Height, in feet above ground and above roof, respectively, were for the anemometer, 72 and 44; rain gage, 32 and 4; thermometers 37 and 9. The exposure was excellent. In August, 1914, the instruments were moved to the roof of the Federal Building, on the corner of Northeast First Avenue and First Street. The heights were, anemometer, 79 and 19; rain gage 64 and 4; thermometers, 71 and 11. Exposures were excellent until November, 1916, when the erection of an eight story building 110 feet south of the instruments reduced the velocity of south winds by 25% or more. In October, 1919, a six story building was erected about 100 feet to the northeast, affecting the velocity of winds from that direction. In November, 1925, a 17 story building was erected east of the instruments resulting in the recording of only a small percentage of east winds. This building was torn down to the fifth floor in December, 1926, greatly improving the exposure. In July, 1927, the wind instruments were moved to the roof of the Seybold Building, near the center of the block bounded by Miami and Northeast First Avenues and Flagler and Northeast First Streets. Height of the anemometer was 168 and 31 feet. ... In July, 1929, the rain gage and thermometers were moved to the Seybold Building. Elevations were, rain gage, 117 and 4; thermometers, 124 and 11. The exposure was excellent until 1939, when a 17 story building 1-1/2 blocks east reduced the velocity of winds from that direction. In January, 1943, the instruments were moved to the roof of the Congress Building, 111 Northeast Second Avenue. Heights were, anemometer, 249 and 19; rain gage, 234 and 4; thermometers 242 and 12. The exposure was excellent except for a slight effect on southwest winds caused by a 17 story building about 250 feet to the southwest. In June, 1948, the instruments were moved to the roof of the east penthouse of the Vocational Education Building, 1410 Northeast Second Avenue. Heights, anemometer 229 and 45; rain gage, 188 and 4; thermometers, 193 and 9. The exposure is excellent except apparently there is some diminution of rainfall catch during high winds.     Bank of Bay Biscayne Building circa 1920s   northwest corner of Miami Avenue and Flagler Street   meteorological observations 1911-1914     Old Federal Building, corner NE 1st Avenue and 1st Street   WBO Miami 1914-1927     Seybold Building entrance circa 1920s (just east of Hotel McCrory)   WBO Miami 1927-1943     Seybold Building, Flagler Street, downtown, today   WBO Miami 1927-1943       Top of Congress Building, 111 NE 2nd Avenue   WBO Miami 1943-1948       Congress Building Entrance, 111 NE 2nd Avenue   WBO Miami 1943-1948   Beginning with July, 1940, ( Alvin Samet remembers 1939 ) official psychrometric observations were made at the Miami Weather Bureau Airport Station, Miami Municipal Airport, 11229 Northwest 42 nd  Avenue, Hialeah, Florida. Dry and wet  bulb thermometers, mounted on standard whirling apparatus, were exposed in an instrument shelter, over   a sod covered plot, bounded 20 feet on the east and 30 feet on the west by paved roads. The location is about 13 miles northwest of central Miami. Biscayne Bay is about 7 miles to the east and Everglades about three miles west. From July, 1942, to February, 1949, these observations were made at Miami International Airport, 5010 Northwest 36 th  Street, about 5-1/2 miles northwest of central Miami. The thermometers were exposed about 5-1/2 feet above the ground, 100 feet north of the main terminal building, over a sodded area bounded by asphalt drives 20 feet to the east, west, and south. Beginning in February, 1949, the readings were obtained from a telepsychrometer, exposed in the same location, over a sodded area of 1000 square feet, surrounded by a paved parking area. Biscayne Bay is 6 miles to the east; the Everglades area lies 3-1/2 miles to the west.  This renewed interest in weather in Miami corresponds well with the national demand for weather information. In 1898, President William McKinley ordered the Weather Bureau to establish a hurricane warning network. Around 1900, the Weather Bureau began to experiment with kites to measure temperature, relative humidity, and winds in the upper atmosphere. In 1909, the Weather Bureau began to use balloons for upper air information, a method still in use today. The advent of aviation changed the Weather Bureau substantially. In 1926, the Air Commerce Act directed the Weather Bureau to provide for weather service to civilian aviation. By the early 1930s kites were becoming a hazard to airplanes in flight, causing kite observations to be discontinued in 1931.  The first Official-in-Charge (OIC) of the newly established WBO in 1911 was  Mr. Richard Gray , who transferred from the old Army Signal Service weather office at Jupiter, Florida. Gray's legacy includes his now famous actions during the devastating category 4 1926 hurricane which struck Miami September 17-18, killing more than 100 people and causing millions of dollars in damage. In the first part of the 20 th  century, warnings for hurricanes were often late and inadequate without modern satellite pictures, computer models, and surface observations. Although storm warnings were issued by the     Damage in downtown Miami after the 1926 hurricane  WBO at noon on the 17 th , hurricane warnings were only issued as the barometer was falling and winds were rising at 11 PM local time, after most Miamians were asleep. Some reports have Gray running through the streets of Miami shouting the warning in an effort to warn the sleeping population of the imminent danger. At 1 AM local time, 2 hours after the warnings were issued, winds reached hurricane force along the coast. Gray also apparently returned to the streets during the passage of the eye of the storm to warn residents venturing outside that the lull would not last and that the wind would return from the opposite direction with greater force that before. Gray's narrative (parts  1926-a ,  1926-b , and  map ) of the 1926 hurricane was included in the American Meteorological Society's publication  Monthly Weather Review .  In 1935, Mr. Ernest Carson became the MIC of the Miami WBO. In July, 1940, the official Miami weather observations began at the Weather Bureau Airport Station (WBAS) at the Miami Municipal Airport, then in Hialeah. Psychrometric observations were begun at the airport at the same time and Mr. Wilmer L. (Tommy) Thompson was the MIC. Thus the City of Miami had a WBO downtown and a WBAS out at the municipal airport. In July, 1942, the WBAS moved to the new Miami International Airport. In 1943, when the downtown weather instruments were moved to the roof of the Congress Building in downtown Miami, the primary hurricane forecast office was moved from Jacksonville to Miami as well.  Mr. Grady Norton  became the Meteorologist-in-Charge of the new office which established a joint hurricane warning service with the Weather Bureau, Air Corps, and Navy. At that time the Miami office shared hurricane warning responsibility with additional offices in New Orleans, San Juan, Boston, and Washington, DC. Norton served as MIC of the Miami office until his death in 1954. During World War II, the first radar, a WSR-3 radar, was installed at Miami.  In 1948, the WBO moved to the Lindsey Hopkins Building (referred to as the Vocational Education Building earlier) at 1410 NE 2 nd  Avenue. After Norton's death in 1954, Mr. Walter Davis became the Acting MIC until a new MIC could be selected.  Mr. Gordon Dunn , at that time MIC of the WBO in Chicago, Illinois, was eventually selected as the new MIC for the Miami WBO. On July 1, 1958, the WBO (city office) moved to the Aviation Building at 3240 NW 27 th  Avenue while WBAS (airport) records continued at the Miami International Airport. The WSR-57 was installed at the Aviation Building in 1959. Temperature records for the downtown site ended with this move. It must be mentioned that prior to the establishment of the airport site, the location of thermometers on top of tall buildings in downtown Miami made the accuracy of temperature records for the period 1914-1958 very suspect, especially in radiational cooling or inversion situations. Even the airport records, because of proximity to asphalt roads, parking areas, and runways, must be considered somewhat suspect until winter, 1977, when they were moved under the instrument landing system at Miami International Airport.  On December 23, 1964, the Miami WBO moved again, this time to the campus of the  University of Miami  and the Computer Building, 1365 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables. In 1967, the Miami WBO was officially designated the National Hurricane Center (NHC) with hurricane forecast responsibility for the Atlantic basin. Official Miami weather records continued to be taken at the Miami International Airport. From 1967 until administrative division in 1984 the National Hurricane Center/National Weather Service histories are the same (numerous articles have been written about NHC history and published in AMS journals). Gordon Dunn retired at the end of the 1967 hurricane season, succeeded by Dr. Robert H. Simpson.         Gables One Tower on South Dixie Highway,   WSFO Miami/NHC home 1979-1995   (note WSR-57 radome on top of building was   blown down by Hurricane Andrew)   In 1970, the Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service (NWS). After the 1973 hurricane season, Dr. Simpson retired and was succeeded by  Dr. Neil Frank . In June, 1979, the NHC moved from the University of Miami to the 5 th  floor of Gables One Tower, an office building across from the university on Dixie Highway. At this time, computers were already being used for forecast modeling purposes at NWS national headquarters in Washington and, to a lesser extent, at field offices. Even so, it wasn't until the early 1980s that the Automation of Field Operations Services (AFOS) system was installed at Miami as part of the first nationwide operational computer and communications system for the NWS.     Miami Weather Forecast Office and the Tropical Prediction Center on the FIU campus, 1995-present   Administrative changes in 1984 resulted in the separation of the NHC from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO). The WSFO assumed forecast and warning responsibility for Florida east of the Apalachicola River under longtime hurricane forecaster Mr. Paul Hebert as its new MIC and the Southern Region of the NWS. The NHC was administratively reassigned under the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in Washington, DC as a national center.  Category 5  Hurricane Andrew  struck south Dade County on August 23-24, 1992. The NWS WSR-57 radar on top of the office building blew down that night. The devastation across south Dade County was severe, making Andrew the costliest hurricane thus far in American history with about 26.5 billion dollars in damages. The new  Doppler radar , the WSR-88D, was installed ahead of schedule due to Andrew in April, 1993, at a location near the Miami Metro Zoo. The WSR-88D was commissioned on April 20, 1995.  In May, 1995, the NHC/WSFO moved into new, hurricane resistant, quarters in the extreme southwest corner of the Florida International University campus close to the intersection of the Florida Turnpike Extension and the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41). On May 12, 1997, an  F1 tornado  moved through downtown Miami, witnessed by thousands as it happened and then millions more as the pictures made national headlines. The tornado was detected and warned for in advance using the WSR-88D Doppler radar. This event, and the  Groundhog Day tornadoes  in February of 1998, were wakeup calls for South Florida residents that hurricanes are not the only severe weather threat for our region. In July, 1998, Paul Hebert retired as MIC of the WSFO, ending a 39 year career in weather, and Mr. Russell Pfost, then science and operations officer at the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, was selected as his successor in August of that year.  In the early 1990s, the NWS embarked on a massive modernization and restructuring plan, which included not only upgrading all the old WSR-57 radars to the new 'Next Generation Warning Radar' (NEXRAD) WSR-88D Doppler radars, but also upgrading computer equipment and reorganizing forecast offices away from state boundaries to radar coverage oriented county warning areas (CWAs). Under the CWA concept, the State of Florida's forecasts and warnings changed from two WSFOs with forecast and warning responsibility (Birmingham, Alabama, and Miami, west and east of the Apalachicola respectively), and a number of smaller WSOs with warning responsibility only (Mobile, Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Daytona Beach, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, West Palm Beach, and Key West) to seven Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) ( Mobile ,  Tallahassee ,  Jacksonville ,  Tampa Bay ,  Melbourne ,  Miami , and  Key West ) with warning and forecast responsibility based on radar coverage. In August, 1998, the new Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) was delivered and accepted at the Miami NEXRAD WSFO (NWSFO) as an eventual replacement for the aging AFOS system.    On November 15, 1999, the CWA concept with seven WFOs was officially started and the old Miami WSFO became the WFO for mainland South Florida. The Miami WFO assumed warning and forecast responsibility for seven counties (Glades, Hendry, Collier, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, and mainland Monroe) and their coastal waters out to 50 nautical miles as well as Lake Okeechobee.   Computers will continue to be a huge part of weather forecasting and warning in the 21st century. As computer technology improves each year, the many calculations required to predict atmospheric motions become easier and faster. Better and better models will be developed in the next several years to provide more accurate and timely forecasts. Automation due to computers is rapidly taking over such duties as broadcasting forecasts and warnings on NOAA Weather Radio, taking routine surface observations (ASOS - Automation of surface observing systems), and upper air balloon observations.  In 2002, the Miami WFO began issuing gridded weather forecasts using a Graphical Forecast Editor as well as our traditional text forecasts. A gridded weather forecast enables our users to see the forecast in a graphical form as well as read it through text. Gridded forecasts from WFOs across the country are now being combined into a  National Digital Forecast Database  (NDFD).    * (interviews also with Gil Clark, Paul Hebert, Max Mayfield, Suzanne Cawn, and the South Florida Historical Society)               Local Climate Water & Weather Topics:   Current Hazards ,  Current Conditions ,  Radar ,  Satellite ,  Climate ,  Weather Safety ,  Contact Us                    National Weather Service  Miami Weather Forecast Office  11691 SW 17th Street   Miami, FL 33165    Webmaster: Wayne Colin   Page last modified: July 9, 2003   Disclaimer   Privacy Policy"

                  Russell Pfost, James Lushine, Alvin Samet*   updated July 29, 2003                                                                         Florida has a longer history than most states with  St. Augustine its  oldest city with over 430 years since its founding in 1565. Even so,  many  of the cities and towns in Florida are very new, especially in the  central  and south sections. Habitation by people in the central and south  counties  of Florida was uncomfortable and unhealthy before the advent of air  conditioning  and mosquito control.              Miami is arguably the best known city in Florida, and it has  experienced  boom and bust throughout its short history. It has known the  Spanish-American  War, Henry Flagler and his railroad, the Roaring Twenties, the  Depression,  World War II, segregation and civil unrest in the 50s and 60s, the  Cuban  missile crisis and the Mariel Boat Lift, and the tremendous influx of  Latin  American immigrants in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. The character of Miami  has  changed dramatically through all this time, and today it is a vibrant,  multi-cultural city with a pervasive Latin flavor of its many  Cuban-American  and Latin American residents.              The following narrative is taken from the  Historical  Museum of Southern Florida 's web site:                                                                         ""Hundreds of years  earlier, before  Christopher Columbus (Cristobal Colon) discovered the New World, the  Tequesta  Indians lived here. The first to appreciate South Florida's mild  climate,  the Tequestans lived simply. Abundant food supplied from the land and  sea  made agricultural activities unnecessary. In 1566, the Tequesta  settlement  was visited by Pedro Menendez de Aviles, his men, and Brother Francisco  Villareal. One year earlier, Menendez had founded St. Augustine, the  oldest  city in the United States, and now came to South Florida to establish a  Jesuit mission. Within a few years it was abandoned and another attempt  to Christianize the Tequestans was not made until 1743. That effort was  also short-lived.                                     During the more than two  centuries  that Florida was controlled by Spain, the Tequestans and other  Prehistoric  Indians of Florida were decimated by European diseases and warfare. The  lands they vacated attracted people from several of the Creek tribes in  Georgia and Alabama who had entered Florida as early as 1704.  Collectively,  they became known as Seminoles, and during the nineteenth century they  would engage in a series of bloody wars against the United States  partly  to defend their right to live in Florida. After the conclusion of the  Third  Seminole War in 1858, the few hundred Indians remaining in the state  lived  in the Everglades.                                     The first permanent white  settlers  in the Miami area arrived in the early 1800s. During the decades that  followed,  a wide variety of individuals left their mark on the history of this  area.  In the 1830s, statesman Richard Fitzpatrick from South Carolina  operated,  with slave labor, a successful plantation on the Miami River. He  cultivated  sugar cane, bananas, corn and tropical fruit. Fitzpatrick was driven  from  his plantation by the Seminole Indians.  Major  William S. Harney , in command at Fort Dallas which was located on  Fitzpatrick's  Plantation on the north bank of the Miami River, led several raids  against  the Indians during the Second Seminole War (1835-1842).""                                                             Fort Dallas was one of a series of forts established  by the U.S. Government  during the Seminole Wars from 1816-1818, 1835-1842, and 1855-1858. The  first weather observations taken in what is now the Miami area were at  Fort Dallas during the Second Seminole War. Temperature records, with  many  breaks, are available from 1839 to 1855 from the Fort Dallas site (also  called ""Biscayne Bay"") near present day 2 nd  Avenue SE and 4 th   Street SE. Temperatures and rainfall are available from the Fort Dallas  site from 1855 to 1858 with many breaks.                            Fort Dallas Slave Quarters, now located in Lummus  Park, downtown  Miami                       U.S. Army Assistant Surgeons at Fort Dallas kept  meteorological  records during the Second and Third Seminole Wars                                                  from the Battle of Olustee, Fla. (Baker County),                       1864, web page                   The War Between the States had little effect on South  Florida outside  of Key West, because of the very few residents and the lack of any  strategic  reason for Confederates to defend the area. Fort Dallas likely remained  in Union hands throughout the war and probably served as a base for  ships  participating in the naval blockade of the Confederacy. In 1870,  President  Ulysses S. Grant signed a joint resolution of Congress establishing a  weather  service within the Army. Observations were taken at 22 sites by the  Army  Signal Corps and the word 'forecast' was first used. An Army Signal  Corps  weather observation site was established at Punta Rassa (near Fort  Myers)  on the west coast, and later at Jupiter in Palm Beach County on the  east  coast. Meteorological observations taken in the Miami area between 1870  and 1880 were called 'Biscayne Bay' and seem to have been taken at  least  part of the time on Key Biscayne where a lighthouse was located.           In 1880, the Fort Dallas/Biscayne Bay temperature and  rainfall records  ended. In 1890, at the request of President Benjamin Harrison, Congress  created the Weather Bureau within the Department of Agriculture. On  December  29, 1894, the State of Florida experienced its worst freeze since 1835  and another severe freeze occurred on February 7, 1895. Partially as a  result of those two severe freezes which were reportedly much less  severe  near Biscayne Bay,  Henry  Flagler  decided  to extend his railroad south from West Palm Beach to the northern shore  of the Miami River and build a luxury hotel there.              Unfortunately, no meteorological records were kept in the Miami area  again until September, 1895, when a new station was established at  Lemon  City (again possibly as a result of those two freezes farther north in  Florida). Lemon City was a town located near the present day  intersection  of NE 2 nd  Avenue and 60 th  Street. From Larry  Wiggins'  study entitled ""The Birth of Miami"" available on the Historical Museum  of Southern Florida's web site:                                                                                    The Miami area, in  the years leading  up to the railroad's arrival, was better known as ""Biscayne Bay  Country.""  The only overland transportation to the area was by a hack (or  stagecoach)  line that ran from Lantana on them southern end of Lake Worth to Lemon  City on Biscayne Bay. The few published accounts from that period  describe  the area as a wilderness that held much promise. Lying five miles north  of the Miami River, Lemon City could boast of only fifteen buildings in  1893. However, many homesteaders had settled on land up to five miles  away  from the core of the settlements. One of these buildings was a new  hotel  that could accommodate twenty-five to thirty guests. Two miles south  were  several people living in Buena Vista. ""Cocoanut Grove"" (as it was  spelled  then) sat ... south of the Miami River; it contained twenty-eight  buildings  ""of a very neat and tasteful character,"" two large stores doing an  ""immense  business,"" and a hotel run by Charles and Isabella Peacock. Cutler,  eight  miles south of Cocoanut Grove, also contained a few settlers.                                                                The Lemon City site (instruments likely kept behind  the  Lemon City Post  Office Building , corner of NE 2nd Ave. and 60th St.), recorded  temperatures and rainfall for five years  from September, 1895 to April, 1900. It was during this time that the  Biscayne  Bay area experienced the first ""boom"" in anticipation of the Flagler  railroad.  The town of Miami was set out on land previously owned by Julia Tuttle  and William Brickell on the north and south sides of the Miami River,  respectively.  The railroad tracks reached Lemon City on April 3, 1896 and the new  town  of Miami (7 miles to the south) only 4 days later on April 7.           As the town of Miami rapidly began to develop, the economic  importance  of spreading information about the mild climate undoubtedly influenced  the establishment of a cooperative temperature and rainfall recording  site  at 131 SE 1 st  Street, now near the heart of downtown, in  December,  1900. Instruments remained there until May, 1911 when the city's first           Weather Bureau Office (WBO)   was established.              The following narrative is taken from Local Climatological Summary for  1949:                                                                                  In June, 1911, a  first order Weather  Bureau station was opened in the  Bank  of Bay Biscayne Building , at the  northwest corner of Miami Avenue and Flagler Street. Instruments were  exposed  on the roof. Height, in feet above ground and above roof, respectively,  were for the anemometer, 72 and 44; rain gage, 32 and 4; thermometers  37  and 9. The exposure was excellent. In August, 1914, the instruments  were  moved to the roof of the  Federal Building , on  the corner of Northeast First  Avenue and First Street. The heights were, anemometer, 79 and 19; rain  gage 64 and 4; thermometers, 71 and 11. Exposures were excellent until  November, 1916, when the erection of an eight story building 110 feet  south  of the instruments reduced the velocity of south winds by 25% or more.  In October, 1919, a six story building was erected about 100 feet to  the  northeast, affecting the velocity of winds from that direction. In  November,  1925, a 17 story building was erected east of the instruments resulting  in the recording of only a small percentage of east winds. This  building  was torn down to the fifth floor in December, 1926, greatly improving  the  exposure. In July, 1927, the wind instruments were moved to the roof of  the Seybold Building ( picture  circa 1920s ,  picture  today ), near the center of the block bounded by Miami and  Northeast First Avenues and Flagler and Northeast First Streets. Height  of the anemometer was 168 and 31 feet. ... In July, 1929, the rain gage  and thermometers were moved to the Seybold Building. Elevations were,  rain  gage, 117 and 4; thermometers, 124 and 11. The exposure was excellent  until  1939, when a 17 story building 1-1/2 blocks east reduced the velocity  of  winds from that direction. In January, 1943, the instruments were moved  to the  roof of the  Congress Building , 111 Northeast Second Avenue. Heights  were, anemometer, 249 and 19; rain gage, 234 and 4; thermometers 242  and  12. The exposure was excellent except for a slight effect on southwest  winds caused by a 17 story building about 250 feet to the southwest. In  June, 1948, the instruments were moved to the roof of the east  penthouse  of the Vocational Education Building (later called  Lindsey Hopkins  Building ), 1410 Northeast Second Avenue. Heights,  anemometer 229 and 45; rain gage, 188 and 4; thermometers, 193 and 9.  The  exposure is excellent except apparently there is some diminution of  rainfall  catch during high winds.                                                                Beginning with July, 1940, ( Alvin Samet remembers  1939 ) official  psychrometric observations were made at the  Miami Weather Bureau Airport  Station , Miami Municipal Airport, 11229 Northwest 42 nd   Avenue,  Hialeah, Florida. Dry and wet bulb thermometers, mounted  on standard whirling apparatus, were exposed in an instrument shelter,  over a sod covered plot, bounded 20 feet on the east  and 30 feet on the west by paved roads. The location is about 13 miles  northwest of central Miami. Biscayne Bay is about 7 miles to the east  and  Everglades about three miles west. From July, 1942, to February, 1949,  these observations were made at Miami International Airport,  5010 Northwest 36 th  Street, about 5-1/2 miles northwest of  central  Miami. The thermometers were exposed about 5-1/2 feet above the ground,  100 feet north of the  main  terminal building , over a sodded area bounded  by asphalt drives 20 feet to the east, west, and south. Beginning in  February,  1949, the readings were obtained from a telepsychrometer, exposed in  the  same location, over a sodded area of 1000 square feet,  surrounded by a paved parking area. Biscayne Bay is 6 miles to the  east;  the Everglades area lies 3-1/2 miles to the west.              This renewed interest in weather in Miami corresponds  well with the national demand for weather information. In 1898,  President  William McKinley ordered the Weather Bureau to establish a hurricane  warning  network. Around 1900, the Weather Bureau began to experiment with kites  to measure temperature, relative humidity, and winds in the upper  atmosphere.  In 1909, the Weather Bureau began to use balloons for upper air  information,  a method still in use today. The advent of aviation changed the Weather  Bureau substantially. In 1926, the Air Commerce Act directed the  Weather  Bureau to provide for weather service to civilian aviation. By the  early  1930s kites were becoming a hazard to airplanes in flight, causing kite  observations to be discontinued in 1931.              The first Official-in-Charge (OIC) of the newly established  WBO in 1911 was  Mr.  Richard Gray ,  who transferred from the old Army Signal Service weather office at  Jupiter,  Florida. Gray's legacy includes his now famous actions during the  devastating  category 4 1926 hurricane which struck Miami September 17-18, killing  more  than 100 people and causing millions of dollars in damage. In the first  part of the 20 th  century, warnings for hurricanes were often  late and inadequate without modern satellite pictures, computer models,  and surface observations. Although storm warnings were issued by the                                             Damage in downtown Miami after the 1926  hurricane                       WBO at noon on the 17 th , hurricane warnings  were only issued as the barometer was falling and winds were rising at  11 PM local time, after most Miamians were asleep. Some reports have  Gray  running through the streets of Miami shouting the warning in an effort  to warn the sleeping population of the imminent danger. At 1 AM local  time,  2 hours after the warnings were issued, winds reached hurricane force  along  the coast. Gray also apparently returned to the streets during the  passage  of the eye of the storm to warn residents venturing outside that the  lull  would not last and that the wind would return from the opposite  direction  with greater force that before. Gray's narrative (parts  1926-a ,           1926-b ,  and  map ) of the 1926  hurricane was included  in the American Meteorological Society's publication           Monthly Weather Review .              In 1935, Mr. Ernest Carson became the MIC of the Miami  WBO. In July, 1940, the official Miami weather observations began at  the           Weather Bureau  Airport Station (WBAS)  at the Miami Municipal Airport, then  in Hialeah. Psychrometric observations were begun at the airport at the  same time and Mr. Wilmer L. (Tommy) Thompson was the MIC. Thus the City  of Miami had a WBO downtown and a WBAS out at the municipal airport. In  July, 1942, the WBAS moved to the new Miami International Airport. In  1943,  when the downtown weather instruments were moved to the roof of the  Congress  Building in downtown Miami, the primary hurricane forecast office was  moved  from Jacksonville to Miami as well.  Mr. Grady  Norton  became the Meteorologist-in-Charge of the new office which  established  a joint hurricane warning service with the Weather Bureau, Air Corps,  and  Navy. At that time the Miami office shared hurricane warning  responsibility  with additional offices in New Orleans, San Juan, Boston, and  Washington,  DC. Norton served as MIC of the Miami office until his death in 1954.  During  World War II, the first radar, a WSR-3 radar, was installed at Miami.              In 1948, the WBO moved to the  Lindsey Hopkins  Building   (referred to as the Vocational Education Building earlier) at 1410 NE 2 nd   Avenue. After Norton's death in 1954, Mr. Walter Davis became the  Acting  MIC until a new MIC could be selected.  Mr.  Gordon Dunn , at that time MIC of the WBO in Chicago, Illinois, was  eventually selected as the new MIC for the Miami WBO. On July 1, 1958,  the WBO (city office) moved to the  Aviation Building   at 3240 NW 27 th   Avenue while WBAS (airport) records continued at the Miami  International  Airport. The  WSR-57  was  installed at the Aviation Building in 1959. Temperature  records for the downtown site ended with this move. It must be  mentioned  that prior to the establishment of the airport site, the location of  thermometers  on top of tall buildings in downtown Miami made the accuracy of  temperature  records for the period 1914-1958 very suspect, especially in  radiational  cooling or inversion situations. Even the airport records, because of  proximity  to asphalt roads, parking areas, and runways, must be considered  somewhat  suspect until winter, 1977, when they were moved under the instrument  landing  system at Miami International Airport.              On December 23, 1964, the Miami WBO moved again, this  time to the campus of the  University  of Miami  and the  Computer  Building, 1365 Memorial Drive , Coral Gables.  In 1967, the Miami WBO was officially designated the National Hurricane  Center (NHC) with hurricane forecast responsibility for the Atlantic  basin.  Official Miami weather records continued to be taken at the Miami  International  Airport. From 1967 until administrative division in 1984 the National  Hurricane  Center/National Weather Service histories are the same (numerous  articles  have been written about NHC history and published in AMS journals).  Gordon  Dunn retired at the end of the 1967 hurricane season, succeeded by  Dr.  Robert H. Simpson .                                       Gables One Tower on South Dixie Highway,                   WSFO Miami/NHC home 1979-1995                   (note WSR-57 radome on top of building was                   blown down by Hurricane Andrew)                                                                In 1970, the Weather Bureau became the National  Weather  Service (NWS). After the 1973 hurricane season, Dr. Simpson retired and  was succeeded by  Dr. Neil Frank .  In June, 1979,  the NHC moved from the University of Miami to the 5 th  floor  of Gables One Tower, an office building across from the university on  Dixie  Highway. At this time, computers were already being used for forecast  modeling  purposes at NWS national headquarters in Washington and, to a lesser  extent,  at field offices. Even so, it wasn't until the early 1980s that the  Automation  of Field Operations Services (AFOS) system was installed at Miami as  part  of the first nationwide operational computer and communications system  for the NWS.                                              Miami Weather  Forecast Office and the Tropical Prediction  Center on the FIU campus, 1995-present                            Administrative changes in 1984 resulted in the  separation  of the NHC from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office (WSFO). The  WSFO  assumed forecast and warning responsibility for Florida east of the  Apalachicola  River under longtime hurricane forecaster  Mr. Paul Hebert  as its new MIC  and the Southern Region of the NWS. The NHC was administratively  reassigned  under the National Meteorological Center (NMC) in Washington, DC as a  national  center. In 1987, Dr. Frank retired and accepted a position in broadcast  meteorology in Houston, Texas. Dr. Bob Sheets  succeeded Dr. Frank as the Director of TPC.              Category 5  Hurricane  Andrew  struck south Dade County on August 23-24, 1992. The NWS  WSR-57  radar on top of the office building blew down that night. The  devastation  across south Dade County was severe, making Andrew the costliest  hurricane  thus far in American history with about 26.5 billion dollars in  damages.  The new  Doppler  radar , the  WSR-88D, was installed ahead of schedule due to Andrew in April, 1993,  at a location near the Miami Metro Zoo. The WSR-88D was commissioned on  April 20, 1995. In May, 1995, the TPC/WSFO moved into new, hurricane  resistant,  quarters in the extreme southwest corner of the Florida International  University  campus close to the intersection of the Florida Turnpike Extension and  the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41). On the TPC side, Dr. Sheets retired in  1995 and was succeeded in 1996  by Dr. Bob Burpee. Dr. Burpee was succeeded in 1997 as Director by  Jerry Jarrell.                        On May 12, 1997, an  F1  tornado  moved through downtown Miami, witnessed by thousands as it  happened and then millions more as the pictures made national  headlines.  The tornado was detected and warned for in advance using the WSR-88D  Doppler  radar. This event, and the  Groundhog  Day  tornadoes  in February of 1998, were wakeup calls for South Florida  residents that hurricanes are not the only severe weather threat for  our  region. In July, 1998, Paul Hebert retired as MIC of the WSFO, ending a  39 year career in weather, and  Mr.  Russell Pfost , then science and operations  officer at the NWS office in Jackson, Mississippi, was selected as his  successor in August of that year. At the TPC, Jerry Jarrell retired in  2000, and was succeeded by current Director Max Mayfield.              In the early 1990s, the NWS embarked on a massive modernization  and restructuring plan, which included not only upgrading all the old  WSR-57  radars to the new 'Next Generation Warning Radar' (NEXRAD) WSR-88D  Doppler  radars, but also upgrading computer equipment and reorganizing forecast  offices away from state boundaries to radar coverage oriented county  warning  areas (CWAs). Under the CWA concept, the State of Florida's forecasts  and  warnings changed from two WSFOs with forecast and warning  responsibility  (Birmingham, Alabama, and Miami, west and east of the Apalachicola  respectively),  and a number of smaller WSOs with warning responsibility only (Mobile,  Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Daytona Beach, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers,  West  Palm Beach, and Key West) to seven Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) ( Mobile ,           Tallahassee ,           Jacksonville ,           Tampa  Bay ,  Melbourne ,           Miami ,  and  Key West ) with warning  and  forecast responsibility based on radar coverage. In August, 1998, the  new  Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) was delivered  and  accepted at the Miami NEXRAD WSFO (NWSFO) as an eventual replacement  for  the aging AFOS system.  On  November 15, 1999, the CWA concept with seven WFOs was officially  started  and the old Miami WSFO became the WFO for mainland South Florida. The  Miami  WFO assumed warning and forecast responsibility for seven counties  (Glades,  Hendry, Collier, Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, and mainland Monroe)  and their coastal waters out to 50 nautical miles as well as Lake  Okeechobee.           Computers will continue to be a huge part of weather  forecasting  and warning in the 21st century. As computer technology improves each  year,  the many calculations required to predict atmospheric motions become  easier  and faster. Better and better models will be developed in the next  several  years to provide more accurate and timely forecasts. Automation due to  computers is rapidly taking over such duties as broadcasting forecasts  and warnings on NOAA Weather Radio, taking routine surface observations  ( ASOS - Automation of surface  observing systems ), and upper air balloon  observations.              In 2002, the Miami WFO began issuing gridded weather forecasts  using a Graphical Forecast Editor as well as our traditional text  forecasts.  A gridded weather forecast enables our users to see the forecast in a  graphical  form as well as read it through text. Gridded forecasts from WFOs  across  the country are now being combined into a  National  Digital Forecast Database  (NDFD).                                                                   Current and Former NHC Directors                                  Here is a picture of the past and current  directors of the National  Hurricane Center at the recent Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, LA.
