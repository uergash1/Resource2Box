The land and real estate boom was already beginning to fade, although many     subdivisions and new communities were still being built. The devastating Great    Miami Hurricane of September, 1926, had already sounded a loud alarm to the new     residents about the vulnerability of their new homes to tropical cyclones. However,    most of the damage from that storm was in Dade and Broward counties. Even so, a    bellwether of what was to come occurred with the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 as     flood waters from Lake Okeechobee were swept by that storm into Moore Haven, the county     seat of Glades County, killing over 100 people.        The City of Palm Beach, founded only 34 years earlier by    Henry Flagler, was incorporated in 1911 and had become a playground for the    rich and famous, while West Palm Beach grew up on the opposite side of Lake    Worth as a place where the support staff lived. The Atlantic breezes were balmy    and the climate was warm. On the opposite side of the county, a quite different    situation was emerging. The rich, black muck soil near Lake Okeechobee was    already being utilized for its tremendous agricultural productivity. The newly    incorporated town of Belle Glade was growing steadily, fueled by the rapidly    expanding agriculture in fields nearby. A rural, agrarian society, dependent on     migrant labor, was plowing and harvesting along the shores of the lake behind a     hastily built muck levee.         Only two years after the Great Miami Hurricane, what would become the second category 4     ( Saffir-Simpson scale ) hurricane to strike South Florida in as many years formed off the    coast of Africa in early September. It churned across the Atlantic, and    devastated the island of Guadeloupe on September 12, moved through the Virgin    Islands, and struck a direct hit on Puerto Rico on the 13 th , El Día    de San Felipe. More than 300 persons were killed by this storm in Puerto Rico,    and it is known as the San Felipe II Hurricane because of the day on which it    struck. To some extent, the devastation in Puerto Rico provided some warning to    residents of Florida’s east coast. It moved through the Bahama Islands on    September 14-15, and on Sunday evening around 615 PM, September 16, the    hurricane made landfall in the United States in Palm Beach County between    Jupiter and Boca Raton.       Approximate location of the landfall   Of the Great Okeechobee/San Felipe   Hurricane of September, 1928.         Damage in coastal Palm Beach County was severe especially in    the Jupiter area where the eye wall of the hurricane persisted longer than at    any other location because of where the storm crossed the coast. A storm surge    around 10 feet with waves likely as high as 20 feet crashed into the barrier    islands including Palm Beach.

As the category 4     hurricane moved inland, the strong winds piled the water up at the south end of the lake,     ultimately topping the levee and rushing out onto the fertile land. Thousands of people,     mostly non-white migrant farm workers, drowned as water several feet deep spread over an     area approximately 6 miles deep and 75 miles long around the south end of the lake.      Approximate location of the eye of the 1928 hurricane   As it swept water out of Lake Okeechobee and over   the towns of Belle Glade, Chosen, Pahokee, South Bay,   and Bean City. More than 2,500 people drowned.              Click the movie logo above to run or ftp a QuickTime movie loop (mov file) of     computer simulated Lake Okeechobee water swept by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane     coming out and over the 4-5 foot levee (at the time).

Lake Okeechobee Region                    A book called  Okeechobee Hurricane  by Lawrence E. Will (who experienced the storm first hand) contains some of the best narrative of what living through the hurricane was like near Lake Okeechobee. The following description is from his book:        The period of the lull here had apparently been between 8:30 and 9:30 that night. The exact time of the breaking of the dike is difficult to determine. There were several breaks and they may have occurred at slightly different times. Although it took an appreciable time for the flood to arrive in Belle Glade, those in the hotel said that when it did arrive, it rose on the steps at the rate of an inch a minute. The highest crest, which was during the maximum velocity of the wind during the second phase of the storm, was, according to my recollection, at 10:20 PM. This crest was a rolling swell of short duration, after which the water fell about a foot and remained nearly constant for twenty minutes.  This mark in Belle Glade was about seven feet above the ground, nearer the lake it  was a great deal higher, for example, in Stein’s house at Chosen, 11 feet 3 inches,  and on Torry (Island) 11 feet, 8 inches, and similar heights in South Bay. As the  flood advanced, it necessarily fanned out, becoming shallower. At the (University of Florida) Experiment Station its maximum depth was three feet, and that, strangely enough, according to foreman Tedder, was after daylight.        Map of Lake Okeechobee (from Gross, 1995)   Showing approximate areas of the flood.        Of course, the effect of the flood was devastating, and the    loss of life, both human and animal, was apocalyptic. Damages    from this hurricane were estimated around 25 million dollars which, normalized    for population, wealth, and inflation, would be around 16 billion dollars today    (Landsea, 2002). The horrible flood in the towns of Pahokee, Canal Point, Chosen,     Belle Glade, and South Bay resulted in the drownings of many people,    probably three quarters or more of whom were non-white field workers. The flood    waters lasted for several weeks, and survivors were found wandering as late as September    22.        Memorial services, one white, one non-white, were held at the same time but at different    locations on Sunday, September 30, 1928, in West Palm Beach. The  Miami Herald  article     (1928) on the memorial services reported nearly 1,000 victims of the hurricane disaster,    674 of whom were non-white. Additional  Miami Daily News  articles stated a death toll of     2,200 (September 24, 1928) and 2,300 (September 25, 1928), along with the observation that     only the death toll in the Galveston hurricane of 1900 was higher. In Will’s book, which seems     to have the best detail on the 1928 hurricane of any source available, the estimated death     toll was at first set at 2,300 but later lowered to 1,770. Will quotes the final Red     Cross report in 1929 as stating that 1,810 people were killed and 1,849 were injured     in the 1928 hurricane. But Will also quoted a news release from the Florida State Board    of Health on December 7, 1928, which estimated the deaths in Palm Beach County    alone at 1,833. From Will’s book:        The exact number of those who perished in the Okeechobee storm can never be  ascertained. Probably three-fourths or more of the casualties were Negroes (sic),  many of whom had come from the Bahama Islands. Accounting for members of this race  was complicated by the migratory habits of their kind and the fact that most of them  were known, even to their friends, only by a nickname. Another reason the number cannot be ascertained was that many were carried by the flood far into the sawgrass wastes.           The NWS has long listed the Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928 death toll as 1,836, making it the    second worst hurricane death toll since 1900. No doubt use of this figure by the NWS dates     to Mitchell (1928), who quoted a Red Cross official casualty estimate dated October 28, 1928.     Dunn and Miller (1960) also quote the Red Cross figure. Pfost (2003) has called for a    revision of the death toll to 2,500 with an asterisk, denoting that the exact    number of people killed will never be known. A new death toll at 2,500 would    make the Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928 the second worst natural disaster in U.S.    history, surpassing the Johnstown Flood of 1889 which killed approximately    2,200.        The hurricane continued northwest across the lake and then turned north through     Highlands and Polk counties, passing near Gainesville and west of Jacksonville before     paralleling the Atlantic coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas. It finally moved inland over    Virginia and became extratropical over Pennsylvania and the Great Lakes.        There is still some tangible evidence of this historical tragedy. In West Palm Beach’s     Woodlawn Cemetery, a  stone marker  stands     today in memory of 69 victims of the storm. At the corner of Tamarind Avenue and 25 th     Street, a new  State of Florida    historical marker  stands in sentinel over the place where 674 victims of    the storm were buried after being transported from the Belle Glade area. At the    Port Mayaca cemetery in Martin County,  another    stone marker  was placed over a mass grave of about 1,600 victims. Near the Belle Glade     Public Library in downtown Belle Glade, a  beautiful    memorial  stands as a remembrance of the deadly storm and its devastation.         While today’s Hoover Dike with a grade elevation approaching 30 feet is reassuring,     it has not yet been tested with a direct hit by a category 4 or 5 hurricane. The only sure     thing is that South Florida will have future encounters with hurricanes, perhaps even a    category 4 or 5, in years to come. It is important that South Florida residents    know our hurricane history in order to better prepare for tomorrow’s hurricane    threats.    REEFERENCES    Dunn, Gordon E., and B. I.

He has been         observing for the National Weather Service for the past 26 years. His         observations include: high and low temperatures, precipitation (rain or         snow), and snow depth measurements. He sends daily observations to us         via a specially equipped phone.           Erdon was born three miles east and one mile south of         Turton, South Dakota. He and his wife Nina farmed there until 1975, when         they retired to Conde. It was lucky for the National Weather Service         that Roland Mannie, a cousin to Erdon, was the Meteorologist In Charge         for the state of South Dakota at the time. Since an observer was needed         in Conde, Roland suggested Erdon for the position. After being offered         the position, Erdon accepted and has taken and maintained weather         records with exceptional quality and accuracy ever since.           Even though Erdon is retired, he continues to be quite         active in the community. He was the mayor of Conde for over 20 years. He         loves the outdoors and is an active hunter and fisherman. During         pheasant season, Erdon welcomes several in state and out of state         hunters.

If you are         interested in helping us collect weather data, please contact Tim Kearns         at (605) 225-0519.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   EMERGENCY MANAGERS - A VITAL LINK                     By George Marshall                   Over the last several issues, we have       highlighted Cooperative Observers and Skywarn Spotters that contribute       greatly to the NWS mission. It is time to look at another group of people       who deal in weather and non-weather related emergencies. They are the       County Emergency Managers, who play a major role in helping us protect the       public.         Emergency Managers are a vital link between the NWS and       our Skywarn Storm Spotters. They arrange Spotter Training classes for       their county, getting the word out so people can attend. They coordinate       the spotters in the county, relaying reports back to the NWS office. This       cuts down on the number of phone calls we have to answer, but still       provides us the information we need to get the warnings out.         After the storms are over, the Emergency Manager is going       to be our main source of information for conducting damage surveys. Being       the experts on their county, they often take us around to view the damage       and arrange interviews with local residents.         Disaster Preparedness is not something that happens       overnight. Emergency Managers and the NWS are partners in protecting the       public. We work closely to prepare the public for dangerous weather       situations.         Of course, weather is only one of the problems Emergency       Managers have to be prepared for. They coordinate all emergency services,       and the county response to local disasters. Its a big job, and our job       would be much harder without their help. We want to thank all the       emergency managers for the part they play in helping us provide life       saving information to the public.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   FLASH FLOODING                     By George Marshall                    Flooding is the number one weather related killer. Each         year, overt 150 people are killed in floods, most of them due to flash         flooding. Flash Flooding occurs in all states, even South Dakota.                     How do flash floods occur?                     Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two         key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate         of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil         conditions, and ground cover also play an important role.           Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving         thunderstorms or thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area.         Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of heavy rainfall, a         dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam.         Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and         bridges, and scour out new channels. Furthermore, flash flood-producing         rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have         a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming.                 How can a foot or two of water cost you your life?                 Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and       typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 miles an hour. When a vehicle stalls       in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to the car. For each       foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to the car.       But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up the       side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, the car       weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises. One foot of water       will carry away most automobiles. Two feet of water will carry away       pickups and large SUVs.                 STAY INFORMED ABOUT THE STORM                 Listen to NOAA Weather Radio, commercial radio, and       television for the latest FLOOD / FLASH FLOOD WATCHES, WARNINGS, and       ADVISORIES.

I would       like to thank our Emergency Managers for their help in scheduling classes       and getting people to attend in their area. I would also like to thank all       the people who attended spotter training classes.         Here are some interesting statistics from spotter training       this year, for the 28 counties we serve. Office staff members traveled       4,934 miles (about 85 hours of driving time) to provide 33 spotter       training classes (about 66 hours) in 26 different counties. We trained 466       spotters , an average of 18 people per county and 14 per class, and about       1/3 of them were new spotters. Codington County had the largest turnout       with 63 people trained in two classes.             Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                               Lightning Safety Awareness         Week                     By George Marshall           The week of June 18th to the 22nd was declared LIGHTNING         SAFETY AWARENESS WEEK by the National Weather Service.                     LIGHTNING AND LIGHTNING SAFETY                     In the United States, there are an estimated 25 million         cloud-to-ground lightning flashes each year. While lightning can be         fascinating to watch, it is also extremely dangerous. Each one of those         25 million flashes is a potential killer. During the past 30 years,         lightning has killed an average of 73 people per year in the United         States based on documented cases. This is more than the average of 68         deaths per year caused by tornadoes and more than the average of 16         deaths per year caused by hurricanes. However, because lightning usually         claims only one or two victims at a time, and because lightning does not         cause the mass destruction left in the wake of tornadoes or hurricanes,         lightning generally receives much less attention than the more         destructive storm-related killers. Documented lightning injuries in the         United States average about 300 per year; however, undocumented injuries         caused by lightning are likely much higher.           Education and awareness are keys to reducing the number         of people struck by lightning. The greatest number of lightning deaths         and injuries in the United States occurs during the summer months when         the combination of lightning and outdoor summertime activities reaches a         peak. During the summer, people take advantage of the warm weather to         enjoy a multitude of outdoor recreational activities. Unfortunately,         those outdoor recreational activities put them at greater risk of being         struck by lightning.           While virtually all people take some protective actions         during the most dangerous part of thunderstorms, many leave themselves         vulnerable to being struck by lightning as thunderstorms approach,         depart, or are nearby. Lightning can strike as much as 10 miles or more         away from the rain area of a thunderstorm; that's about the distance         that you can hear the thunder from the storm. In some instances when a         storm is ten miles away, it may even be difficult to tell that a storm         is nearby. However , IF YOU HEAR THUNDER, CHANCES ARE THAT YOU ARE         WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THAT STORM.                     Finally, in the unfortunate event that a person is         struck by lightning, medical care may be needed immediately to save that         person's life. Cardiac arrest and irregularities, burns, and nerve         damage are common in cases where people are struck by lightning.         However, with proper treatment, including CPR if necessary, most victims         survive a lightning strike, although the long-term effects on their         lives and the lives of family members can be devastating.           What are the chances that a person will be struck by         lightning during his or her lifetime? Answer: Based on documented cases         of lightning deaths and injuries, the nationwide odds of being killed or         injured by lightning are about 1 in 700,000 for each year of your life.         Assuming a life span of 80 years, that's lifetime odds of more than 1 in         9000. These odds are based on documented cases only and would likely be         much higher if all lightning strike cases were documented. Keep in mind,         though, that your behavior around thunderstorms will determine your         individual odds.

As for the James River, flooding       usually occurs as a rite of passage from winter to spring, with spring or       summer flooding occurring annually over the last decade. Flooding along       the James River inundates many acres of farm land each year. Since 1996,       areas of Central and Northeast South Dakota have been hit hard by       flooding. Since flooding is an annual event along the James River, we will       not include the James River in this article. We are not downplaying the       seriousness of flooding along the James River which affects many farmers       and closes area roads, but there is too much information to include in       this article. The following below was taken from the Local Storm Report       and was condensed for this article.                 May 27-30, 1996 -  Four to six inches of rain fell over       the Bad River Basin. The runoff caused the Bad River at Fort Pierre to       crest at 26.25 feet, or about 5 feet above flood stage. The Bad River road       from US Highway 83 near Fort Pierre to US Highway 14 near Midland was       closed.                 February 20-22, 1997  - Warm weather resulted in snow       melt runoff and ice break up on the Bad River. The river crested near 25.0       feet on the 21 st . The trailer court on the southern edge of       Fort Pierre was evacuated.                 March-April, 1997  - Record or near record snow pack       from the winter of 1996/97 led to widespread flooding of homes, basements,       county/township roads, and many acres of farmland across the region. In       Big Stone and Traverse Counties, some bridges were damaged or washed out       due to high water flows or ice chunks. The Little Minnesota River flooded       several homes in west Browns Valley. In Dewey County, the Moreau River set       a record crest of 27.4 feet on March 21 st  at the river gage       site two miles southeast of Whitehorse. The Bad River in Stanley County       crested at 22.1 feet at Fort Pierre on March 22 nd . Meanwhile,       the Grand River one mile south of Little Eagle in Corson County crested at       17.3 feet on March 24. A second crest of 16.2 feet was recorded on March       29 th . Residents of Wakpala in eastern Corson County watched the       Oak Creek rise five feet in 12 hours. In Brown County, the Elm River at       Westport rose to 21.5 feet on March 30 th  with most of the town       flooded. Nearly everyone was evacuated as nearly every home received major       flood damage. This was the worst flooding in Westport since 1969.       Backwater from flooding caused the Mocassin Creek to flood a portion of       the Prairewood housing subdivision north of Aberdeen. Over in Spink       County, Turtle Creek set a record crest of 18.1 feet on March 30 th .       In Codington County, record flooding was reported on the Big Sioux River       while Lake Kampeska flooding homes in Watertown. This was declared       Watertowns greatest disaster to date.                 May 1-2, 1997  - Heavy rains of one to three inches       with isolated amounts up to 4.5 inches just north of Vivian in Lyman       County flooded area creeks, streams, and roads. Flooding occurred at the       KOA campground near Kennebec.                 July 11, 1997 -  Between three to four inches of rain       fell over northeastern Dewey, northwestern Walworth, and southeastern       Corson Counties. Water covered portions of Highway 12 near Mobridge and       Highway 15 north of Mobridge.                 July 24-25, 1997  -   Six inches of rain fell in       Conde in Spink County which flooded Highway 37. In Hamlin County,       Estelline reported nearly six inches of rain while a Lake Poinset observer       recorded nearly seven inches of rain. Hidewood Creek overflowed its banks       while Highway 28 was closed for about an hour.                 May 11, 1998  - Rainfall amounts of two to five inches       fell across Brown, Marshall, Day, Spink, Clark, and Hand Counties as a       cluster of strong thunderstorms moved through the area. The heavy rains       only worsened the flooding on Blue Dog, Waubay, Rush, and Bitter Lakes,       which were already at record levels after many years of above normal       precipitation.                 June 10, 1998  - Two to three inches of rain that fell       in a short period of time, causing flash flooding on the Crow Creek       southwest through south of Gann Valley (Buffalo County). Some dams and       roads were washed out.                 June 17-18, 1998  - Heavy rains of three to four inches       fell across parts of eastern Faulk county near Faulkton, Miranda, Orient,       and Cresbard. Several roads were flooded and closed for a period of time.                 June 26-27, 1998  - Brown, Marshall, and Day Counties       received the brunt of the heavy rainfall. Kidder reported nearly seven       inches of rain, flooding the whole town, while just northwest of Britton       an observer reported over five inches of rain during this period. At this       time, it was estimated that about 22 percent of the total farm and       pastureland acres in these three counties were flooded or too wet to farm.                 July 10, 1998  - Up to seven inches of rain caused       flash flooding from Keldron to ten miles south of Keldron in Corson County       . Willow Creek and several tributaries went out of their banks, resulting       in flooding of county roads and the loss of livestock.                 July 25, 1998  - Five to seven inches of rain fell in       western Jones County, mainly northwest of Okaton. Three miles northwest of       Okaton, a road and bridge were washed out.                 August 26-27, 1998 -  Strong to severe thunderstorms       pounded Campbell, Walworth, and eastern Corson Counties. Rainfall amounts       of 6.35 inches near Glenham, and 5.75 inches just north of Mobridge       created flash flooding in the area. The heavy rain was associated with       damaging winds and large hail that damaged buildings and crops.                 May 9-10, 1999  - Heavy rains of two to five inches       caused flash flooding on Medicine Creek in Lyman County. Portions of the       KOA campground near Kennebec was flooded.                 September 3, 1999  - Nearly stationary thunderstorms       resulted in extensive flash flooding in a 30 to 40 mile wide band from       Fort Pierre in southeast Stanley County northeastward to Hecla in       northeast Brown County. Blunt (Hughes Co.) and Onida (Sully) were the       hardest hit with most of the homes and businesses being flooded in both       communities.                 Spring 2001   See article on page 6 for details on       flooding that hit Central and Northeast South Dakota.         As you can see, flooding or flash flooding occurs       infrequently over the region. However, when flooding does occur, the       consequences to life and property are great.               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   FACTS ABOUT FLOODS / FLASH         FLOODS                     By David Hintz           Many people are unaware that Floods and Flash Floods         are the leading weather killer in the United States, taking about 200         lives per year. Since 1900, more than 10,000 lives have been lost due to         floods and flash floods. In fact, one of the countrys worst flooding         disasters took place in South Dakota on June 9,   1972. Five         inches of rain fell in just five hours in the Black Hills above Rapid         City. The resulting flash flood took 238 lives with property damage of         164 million. Out of every 10 Presidential Disaster Declarations, 9 are a         result from natural phenomena in which flooding plays a role.           So why is flooding and flash flooding such a major         weather killer? Nearly 80% of all flood related deaths occur in         automobiles, and most of those are the result of a single, fatal         decision to drive into flood waters. You may ask, ""How can 1 to 2         feet of water be so deadly?"" One cubic foot of water weighs 62.4         pounds, and typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 mph. Also, one foot of         water produces a lateral force of 500 pounds. But, its not the lateral         force that creates the problem, but the buoyancy of the automobile. One         foot of water will displace 1500 pounds. In essence, if you drive         through 2 feet of moving water, your vehicle will feel a force of 1000         pounds pushing it downstream, and will weigh 3000 pounds less. Not many         vehicles will stay on the road with forces like that. Also consider         this, one-third of all flooded roads and bridges are so damaged by the         water that any vehicle trying to cross stands only a 50% chance of         making it to the other side.           If you happen to come across a flooded road or         bridge, do the wise thing and turn around and find another route. Its         the safe thing to do.

A dam         break created a 36 to 40 foot wall of water that swept through parts of         the town. 2,200 people perished in this flood.           Up to 17 inches of rain over South Central Texas         caused widespread river flooding on the Guadalupe, Brazos, Trinity, and         Colorado River Basins during December 1991 and January 1992. The         flooding left 15 people dead and caused 100 million dollars in damage.           In Shadyside, Ohio, four inches of rain in less than         two hours produced a 30 foot wall of water through parts of town. The         flood killed 26 people and property damage was estimated between six and         eight million dollars.           In Cheyenne, Wyoming, six inches of rain in three hours left 12 dead         and caused 61 million dollars in property damage.

Normally, the first         product issued by the National Weather Service in mid and late February         is the  Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook . This product is of interest         to everyone, especially emergency managers, farmers, and people living         near rivers and streams. With above normal snowfall winters, such as         this past one, this product becomes very important in flood planning and         preparations.           The  Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook  accounts for         many factors to produce the flood potential outlook. The most important         factor in this outlook is the winter snow-pack and amount of water         contained within it. The outlook also factors in the current river         flows, soil moisture, and the climatological outlook of precipitation         and temperature. It is very important to note that future temperatures         and precipitation can have a significant impact on the flood potential.         Therefore, the Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook only serves as an initial         guideline for flood planning and preparation purposes. As was stated         earlier, the winter snow-pack has the most overwhelming influence on the         spring flood potential. The Spring Snowmelt Flood Outlook provides         information for each of the major rivers in the Aberdeen County Warning         Area. The flood potential in the outlook is depicted using the following         terminology: major, moderate, minor, or no flooding expected.           If flooding is expected or does occur as a result of         snowmelt and/or above normal precipitation,  Flood Warnings  are         issued for the river or rivers expected to flood. Flood Warnings are         issued when the water level is expected to rise above a certain height         and remain above this height for more than 6 hours up to weeks, and for         the James River, months.  Flood Statements  are issued after the         initial Flood Warning to provide follow up information and river stage         forecasts. Ice jamming is a common problem on the rivers in the spring         and can cause significant fluctuations in river stages.           After the snow melts and the late spring and summer         heats up, the thunderstorm and heavy rain potential increases. If there         is a possibility of significant rainfall, the National Weather Service         may issue a  Flash Flood Watch or a Flood Watch  to alert you on         the expected rainfall amounts and possible flooding or flash flooding.         Flash flooding occurs over a shorter period of time, typically less than         6 hours, and is more dangerous. Flash flooding is dangerous because         creeks and streams are expected to rise quickly and move swiftly. Moving         water, especially deep moving water, can easily float and move a vehicle         off the road. Thus, you should never cross a flooded road and be         especially alert at night for flooding. If the flooding is expected to         be more of an inconvenience then we may issue an  Urban and Small         Stream Flood Advisory.           The National Weather Service issues several products         from late winter into the fall to keep you informed on the potential         and/or expected flooding in your area. These products can help you plan         and prepare, but your actions become the most important in minimizing         property damage along with determining your safety.                   Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   4TH OF JULY WEATHER                     By Seth Binau                    Now that Spring has come and gone, our thoughts turn to         the warm Summer months. Summer seems to be defined by its holidays, with         the Fourth of July kicking off the peak of the warm months, and Labor         Day finishing it off. Everyone likes to spend the Fourth of July         outdoors, either at a picnic or watching evening fireworks. With such a         large portion of the population outdoors, the weather certainly will         have a tremendous affect on how you plan your Fourth. Looking back over         past Independence Days, you can expect just about everything in South         Dakota on July 4 th , except snow.           For example, you may remember Independence Day in         1967...when strong Canadian high pressure dropped temperatures into the         lower 40s in South Dakota. Aberdeen and Watertown shivered at 40         degrees, while Sisseton dropped to 44, and Pierre watched their         fireworks at 43 degrees. Instead of shorts and tank tops, a heavy jacket         would have been needed in 1967.           There is the contrary to 1967, though, and that would be         the two big drought years in the Northern Plains. 1936 and 1988 brought         record heat all Summer long in South Dakota, and Independence Day was no         exception. In 1936, Pierre sweltered at 107 degrees, and Mobridge at         103. In eastern South Dakota, 1988 was a record Fourth of July for         Aberdeen (105 degrees), Sisseton (101), and Watertown (102).           While heat and cold can be a nuisance on a big outdoors         day such as the Fourth, nothing can ruin it like a typical South Dakota         thunderstorm. Unfortunately, Watertown knows all about this, as 2.69         inches of rain fell on Independence Day in 1963. Aberdeens biggest         rainfall on the Fourth occurred in 1969, when a thunderstorm dropped         1.02 inches of rain. Mobridge is the lucky one on the Fourth, with a         record rainfall of only 0.80 inch in 1932. Both Pierre and Watertown         have seen record rainfalls close to an inch as well on Independence Day.           So, on this Fourth of July, you will be fully prepared         if you wear clothes for temperatures in the 80's, some that can be         removed if it hits the 100's, and an extra jacket in case it drops into         the 40's at night, and bring the trusty umbrella as well!               Back to the top       Back to the Aberdeen Homepage          Back to the Sky Scanner Page                                   SPRING FLOODING ACROSS THE         ABERDEEN HYDROLOGICAL SERVICE AREA                     By Glenn Nielsen           Flooding began early in South Dakota this spring. On         the 14 th  of March, the Bad River in Central South Dakota         began flooding due to ice jams causing minor flooding of a trailer park         in Ft. Pierre. Also on the 14 th , flood warnings were issued         for the Grand and Moreau Rivers in North Central South Dakota, but         little if any damage was reported. On March 28 th , the James         River in Columbia went above flood stage with minor agricultural         flooding. The rest of the James River basin from Columbia south to         Redfield experienced minor to moderate flooding for much of April into         early May. Generally, agricultural land was affected as well as some         township roads. By early May, streams around the Redfield area had all         fallen below flood stage. From Ashton north to Columbia the James River         is expected to remain above flood stage until at least mid July. Further         east, major flooding occurred on the Big Sioux River from Watertown to         Castlewood during April. Spring snowmelt as well as heavy rain caused         the Big Sioux River to go above flood stage from April 7-19 at Watertown         and Castlewood and again in Castlewood from the 23 rd  to the         25 th . Watertown received 6.48 inches of precipitation in         April or 4.3 inches above normal. Especially hard hit along the Big         Sioux was the Lake Kampeska area Northwest of Watertown. A record stage         was recorded on the river gage 8 miles northwest of Watertown with a         reading of 12.2 feet. The previous record was 12.1 feet on April 6,         1997.

We were in         search of volunteers that had an anemometer which displays wind speeds         and direction, and have the capability of storing peak wind speeds.           Last year we honored eight members for being with the         program for five years. We will honor six more members this year. The         members are: Morris Riggin of Milbank Airport in Grant County, Leland         Treichel of Edmunds County, Jane Barber of Bretts Spray Service in         Sully County, Clarence Juelich of Wheaton Airport in Traverse County         Minnesota, Tom Bartholomew of Faulk County, and David Stolpman of Big         Stone County Minnesota. They have received a Certificate of Appreciation         for five years of service. Our hats are tipped to these volunteers and         we are very thankful for all the help.           The National Weather Service in Aberdeen is always         looking for new member to join the program. If you are interested in         joining the Wind Reporting Network System, all you need is an         anemometer! They can be purchased from a variety of private companies,         ranging in price from around $180 to near $800.

Total precipitation for March amounted to 0.10 to 0.45 inches above         normal. Average temperatures were near normal across central South         Dakota, but across northeast sections of the state and into West Central         Minnesota readings were around 5 to 10 degrees below normal. April was         very wet with near normal temperatures. A late April snowstorm dumped         6-13 inches of wet snow from Central through Northeast South Dakota,         except along the South Dakota and Minnesota border only receiving rain.         Total precipitation for Watertown in April totaled 6.48 inches.

Those in the affected area are urged to be                    ready to take action if a flash flood warning is issued or flooding                    is observed. These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours. It could be issued for rural                    or urban areas as well as for areas along the major rivers.                    Very heavy rain in a short period of time can lead to flash                    flooding, depending on local terrain, ground cover, degree of                    urbanization, amount of man-made changes to the natural river                    banks, and initial ground or river conditions. Dam breaks or                    ice jams can also create flash flooding.                                          Flash Flood Statement                     - A Flash Flood Statement is issued to inform the public about                    current flash flood conditions. These statements usually contain                    river stage information if major streams or rivers are involved.                                                             Urban/Small Stream Flood Advisory                     - Alerts the public to flooding which is generally only an inconvenience                    (not life-threatening) to those living in the affected area.                    Issued when heavy rain will cause flooding of streets and low-lying                    places in urban areas. Also used if small rural or urban streams                    are expected to reach or exceed bankfull. Some damage to homes                    or roads could occur.

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.                    In mountainous or flat terrain, distant rain may be channeled                    into gullies and ravines, turning a quiet streamside campsite                    or wash into a rampaging torrent in minutes .                                                                        •                     Flooding                                         - Of all the tricks in mother nature's weather bag, the deadliest                    in the United States today is flooding and flash flooding. Over                    the past 30 years, flood waters have claimed an annual toll                    of nearly 140 lives in this country.                                                                            •                      Natural                     Hazards   -  With Safety Rules                    For Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Floods, Flash Floods, Thunderstorms/Lightning,                    Winter Storms WATCH: Severe weather is possible within the designated                    watch area.                                                      •                      National Weather Service                    Low-Water Crossing Flood Safety Video                     -  The NWS, as a public service, provides                    a video (at nominal cost) to disseminate motorist safety information.

These watches are issued for flooding that is expected                    to occur within 6 hours after the heavy rains have ended.                                          Flash Flood Warning                     - A flood warning issued for life/property threatening flooding                    that will occur within 6 hours.

Flash              floods are the #1 weather-related killer in the United States--2,200              deaths in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, May 31, 1889; 238 fatalities in              Rapid City, South Dakota, June 9, 1972; 140 killed in the Big Thompson              Canyon near Denver July 31, 1976; 26 dead in Shadyside, Ohio, June              14, 1990!

They                    are caused by stationary or slow-moving thunderstorms that produce                    heavy rain over a small area. The Black Hills are especially                    vulnerable to flash floods, where steep terrain and narrow canyons                    can funnel heavy rain into small creeks and dry ravines, turning                    them into raging walls of water. Even on the prairie, normally-dry                    draws and low spots can fill with rushing water during very                    heavy rain.                                                       •                      Flash                    Flood -  Flash                    floods can strike any time and any place with little or no warning.

Now, it's back.                Discovered only 3 months ago, Comet ""Neat""               (designation C/2002 VI) is now visible in the evening sky. Named               for the NASA/U.S. Air Force program that discovered it ( N ear               E arth  A steroid  T racking system), the comet               is approaching its closest point to the Sun in its highly               elliptical orbit. Currently at a magnitude of +5.4, it isn't visible to the               naked eye in most locations, but should be easily found using               binoculars. Take this rare opportunity to view this comet, as               calculations of its orbit indicate that it  returns only once               every 37,000 years .                                                                   In the early evening sky, about an hour or so               after sunset, look to the western sky just below the Great Square of Pegasus. At               about 20 above the horizon, Comet Neat can be observed in               binoculars or a small telescopes as a circular patch of light with               an almost star-like center. The comet should become increasingly               brighter until around mid month, when it will become lost               from sight as it passes around the Sun.                                                                 Neat should make its closest approach to the Sun on February               18th, at a distance of only 9.2 million miles (the nearest               approach to the Sun by Mercury, the innermost planet, is 28.6               million miles). To endure such heat and gravity, the comet must be rather large, as               smaller bodies would be destroyed by such proximity to our star.               Should it survive, it will become visible again after the 18th               and many astronomers are predicting that it will be somewhat               brighter at that time.                                                                                     Position of Comet ""Neat"" in February                                                                  The moon will become increasingly brighter into mid February, and               will be in the western section of the sky after sunset. This may               hamper your viewing of the comet somewhat, but it will be your               only opportunity to ever see this very infrequent visitor.                                                                     February 2003 Moon Phases                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1                        9                        16                        24                                                                                                                                                     Local Climate, Water & Weather Topics:                                                       Current Hazards ,                                                      Current Conditions ,                                                      Radar ,                                                      Satellite ,                                                      Climate ,                                                      Weather Safety ,                                                      Contact Us                                                                                                                                                                          National Weather                           Service                           Grand Junction Weather Forecast Office                           792 Eagle Drive                           Grand Junction, CO. 81506                            Webmasters:                                                       Jeff Colton                            &                                                       Brian Avery                            Page last modified: July 22,                           2002                                                                              Disclaimer                                                                              Privacy Act"

Introduction . This chapter provides the policy and guidelines for operating and managing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio (NWR) program. This policy has been revised due to the deployment of the NWR Console Replacement System (CRS), henceforth referred to as the NWR system (except in document titles), and its greatly enhanced broadcasting capabilities. A specific description and details on the operation and use of the NWR system and optimization of the automated voice can be found in the ""CRS Site User's Manual,"" the ""CRS Jump Start Kit: The Introductory Guidebook,"" and in the ""DECtalk Software NWS/NOAA Style Guide."" See section 8 for administrative guidelines on NWR quality control. Regional and local instructions provide additional information and detail for day-to-day operations.              1.1  Fundamental Concepts . The NWR system provides automated, real-time, text-to-voice operations, using formatted text input from the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) or other approved sources (legacy systems). The NWR system also supports manual broadcast recording and scheduling operations for products not supported by text formatters, also referred to as ""manual operations,"" and for operations for critical events including backup.             NWR is the official voice of the National Weather Service (NWS) . To many listeners, the NWR  is  the NWS. It is therefore critically important that NWR broadcasts adhere to the highest standards of timeliness, completeness, accuracy, and clarity. The use of the automated voice of NWR will improve timeliness of NWR. Any text should have full sentences, correct spelling, and effective punctuation to achieve clear communication.             The new and enhanced scheduling capabilities were created to allow fresh, innovative approaches to NWR programming. Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) are encouraged to broadcast a short core base of sequenced messages (as defined in section 5.2), with more detailed information broadcast on a ""time insert"" basis. One example of this time-based information includes broadcasts of specific customer-focused messages at a prescribed time during the hour, day, week, month, or year.             1.2  Use of NWR Automated Voice . A goal of the NWS is to use automated voicing technology for broadcast of all messages. During the early transition to the automated voicing capability, WFOs may employ manual operations for the broadcast of critical warning information (weather- and non-weather-related, see section 6). For these situations, WFOs should follow reporting procedures as outlined in section 3.3.     1.3  Official Voice of the Government for Providing Warning Information to the Public . In January 1975, the Office of Telecommunications Policy, Executive Office of the President (now the Department of Commerce [DOC]), issued a national policy statement establishing NWR as ""the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public."" It also designated NWR as a supplementary attack warning system. The full text of the policy statement is shown in appendix A. Note that since January 13, 1975, the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency and the Office of Preparedness have been reorganized and renamed under the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).         1.4  NWR ""All Hazards"" Approach . NWR broadcasts will continue expanding to include warning and post-event information for all types of hazards--both natural (e.g., weather, floods, earthquakes, and volcanic activity) and technological (e.g., chemical releases, oil spills, or nuclear incidents). In conjunction with other Federal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System (EAS) (see section 10), NWR can reach the vast majority of the population with this ""all hazards"" information through the Nation's electronic media.     2.  Description . NWR is a broadcast service of the NWS for the public. It provides continuous automated or recorded voice FM-radio broadcasts of current official weather information (warnings, watches, forecasts, observations, etc.). The broadcast system consists of:             a. A description of the NWR system, components, and capabilities. This description can be found in the material listed in section 1.     b. A communication link (dedicated telephone line, ultra high frequency radio, or microwave radio) between the transmitter audio output of the audio switching assembly and the broadcast transmitter. Each transmitter has its own dedicated communication link.             c. A narrow-band very high frequency (VHF) transmitter operating on one of the following Government-assigned frequencies: 162.400, 162.425, 162.450, 162.475, 162.500, 162.525, and 162.550 Megahertz (MHZ).             d. Remote Off-Air Monitoring System (ROAMS) (see section 8.1 for details), emergency power systems, telephone and other utilities, and services required for continuous operation.      e. A 1050 Hertz (Hz) tone and/or NWR Specific Area Message Encoder (NWR-SAME) transmission that either sounds an alarm or switches specially equipped NWR receivers from standby to full-on mode for weather or non-weather-related emergencies (see section 6). This can be done through the NWR system automation or in manual mode when using the backup live function. See ""CRS Site User's Manual"" or other local instructions for operation of NWR-SAME.             3.  Organizational Responsibilities .             3.1  Weather Service Headquarters (WSH) . The NWS Director has the overall national broadcast policy responsibility for the NWR program. The Office of Meteorology (OM) facilitates the establishment and uniform application of the national broadcast policy in coordination with the Office of Hydrology (OH), the Office of Systems Operations (OSO), the NOAA/NWS Office of Public Affairs, and the Regional Headquarters (RH). The OH provides input on hydrological-related broadcast messages. The OSO provides engineering, communications, maintenance, and program management support. The NOAA/NWS Public Affairs is responsible for coordinating a national program for NWR public education and promotion. See section 12 for additional details. See section 3.2 on RH responsibilities.              3.2  Regional Headquarters . Each RH is responsible for the management of the program within its area and should have a designated focal point for the NWR program. In addition, each RH shall have responsibility for the oversight of an NWR Operator Proficiency Program (see section 8 and appendix B) and review and evaluation of NWR broadcasts. The Regional Director shall coordinate, define, and document in regional instructions the basic service areas for all NWR stations in the region. The RH shall send to OM a quarterly report on usage of the automated voicing for critical warning messages by their WFOs, along with any reasons for non-usage.              3.3  Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) . WFO management is responsible for adopting these guidelines and regional directives consistent with local service requirements and staffing. Each WFO should have an NWR program leader (see section 8.2 for details). All operational employees shall be proficient at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories via NWR operational and any backup broadcast systems in accordance with the NWR Operator Proficiency Program (see appendix B).             3.3.1  Record Keeping . The NWR system will automatically maintain a log to assist in determining the currency of all broadcast material and the operational status of the equipment. In the event of the NWR system failure, the WFO should maintain a manual log, status board, or other equivalent mechanism for this purpose.         4.  Broadcast Programming Goal .             4.1  Broadcast Service Area . The broadcast shall concentrate on providing vital and relevant weather and hydrologic information to the people within the service area of the transmitter. The service area shall be the region for which the warning alarm is authorized for use. As mentioned in section 3.2, the RH shall establish and document the official service area of each NWR station. Any changes must be approved by the RH.             The service area for each transmitter site is normally defined by counties or parts of counties or other defined areas and adjacent coastal or offshore waters where there is a  reliable  free space signal. Under ideal conditions, this would be a uniform ground-level signal of 8 microvolts within a 40-mile radius of the transmitter. The signal level will vary as a result of terrain, urban density, obstructions, and antenna mounting arrangements.             Because a service area depends on signal reception, it may extend beyond the programming office's warning and forecast area of responsibility.  For areas with overlapping coverage by multiple transmitters, routine programming for the overlapped area may be broadcast solely on the transmitter providing the best coverage . Periodic announcements over NWR should mention or define the service area. Distribution of maps showing the service area is encouraged as part of any NWR publicity.             No attempt should be made to extend an NWR service area to accommodate listeners employing sophisticated high gain receiving equipment.             4.2  Broadcast Quality . The following broadcast practices are recommended to improve program quality and usability.             4.2.1  Style of Presentation . The broadcasts should be in complete sentences for both the lead-in and main text. It is useful to use the word ""you"" as appropriate when referring to listeners. This projects interest and concern.             Summarizing : In general, it is useful to summarize tabular data, except in cases where precise listings are necessary or preferred by listeners.             Wording : All messages should use the past or future tense.             Time on Messages : Broadcasts should include time on messages that contain highly perishable material. These would include observations, radar or other position reports, and river stages.             Issue times should not be used for forecasts, watches, warnings, and related statements. The only times that are important in these cases are those for occurrences and expiration of an event.             5.  Broadcast Message Priority . NWR programming consists of four major elements in order of the following broadcast priority:             a. Messages for critical events for the service area. These normally include warnings, short-fuse watches, and other non-weather-related hazard information. See section 6 for specific details.             b. Basic core messages (always included unless     de-emphasized or pre-empted by messages for critical events). These normally include the station I.D., the hourly roundup, the service area forecast and the synopsis, and optionally a regional forecast. The basic core messages may vary according to local customer needs. See appendix C for program guidelines.             c. Special customer messages (desirable). These normally include marine forecasts, lake and river stage reports, recreation/resort forecasts, climatic data, fire weather forecasts, air quality information, weather-related road information, Ultraviolet Index (UVI) forecasts, and non-weather-related announcements. See appendix C for program guidelines.             d. Educational and promotional messages (desirable, but optional). These normally include safety messages and announcements of awareness activities. See section 5.3 for further details.             Although there is special customer programming for groups with similar interests,  NWR broadcasts should not be tailored to the needs of any individual person or individual business entity .     5.1  Guidelines . The NWR system programming is not solely based on the logic of sequencing through products. Offices are encouraged to find innovative uses of programming functionality to best meet the preferences of the listeners. The dynamic use of time-insertion for certain products and frequent cycling of others is a good basic approach. When manually recording products, use a professional, but conversational, news style delivery.             AWIPS will provide text formatters to produce NWR messages with conversational style. Basic format requirements should be followed in manual mode as well.             Concerning operations for critical events, emphasis must be placed on watch/warning repetition, updates, and call to action statements with low (or even no) priority placed on the routine core and special customer broadcasts. See appendix D, the ""CRS Site User's Manual,"" and the ""CRS Jump Start Kit: The Introductory Guidebook"" for basic terms, approaches, and definitions related to the NWR system broadcast scheduling. See sections 5.2 and 6 for detailed guidelines on broadcasting operations for critical events.             5.2  Content . Messages should concentrate on what has recently happened and what is forecast to happen. Messages should not be aired longer than 6 hours after issuance. Stations with designated service areas that cross state lines shall provide balanced information and not favor one state over the other.             State or area weather summaries providing past weather information not related to future conditions either should not      be broadcast or broadcast only for a limited time interval up to a few hours. Messages of national coverage should not be broadcast except to highlight an event of long-term interest, such as a hurricane threatening the United States or a major winter storm.     5.3  Non-Weather-Related Announcements . Only announcements (from NWS or from non-NWS sources) fitting one of the following criteria should be permitted.             o Activities that will assist the NWS to fulfill its primary mission, such as NWR surveys, major public preparedness activities, open houses, dedications, safety information, and educational and promotional information about NWS products and services.             -- Some of these announcements are appropriate for random or occasional broadcast. These messages should be shorter than 60 seconds, preferably between 15 and 20 seconds. No more than two such messages should be used at any one time. Prerecorded messages may be used.             o Civil emergency and other non-weather-related messages authorized in section 6.5.             o Other messages requested through official channels by the DOC/NOAA, such as outlined in the National Marine Fisheries Service Memorandum of Agreement, that are construed to be time critical and related to the NOAA mission.             If doubt exists whether a message meets one of the criteria, it should be coordinated with the RH through the WFO. If further doubt exists within the RH, it shall be coordinated with OM.             Non-NWS sources of information should be identified.             5.4  Unauthorized Material . Care must be taken to ensure that no unauthorized or improper material (or improper language) is broadcast, either directly or indirectly (through background noise when in manual broadcast mode). If the NWR system is in the operational area, it is important to remember to limit or restrict background noise when recording manually.              Specific material that is restricted from NWR broadcasts include:             o aviation weather in any form (i.e., ceilings, altimeter, terminal forecasts, etc.);     o music in any form or style, except as authorized by RH;     o encoded data, except NWR-SAME;     o excessive technical terms;     o foreign languages (except when authorized by RH);     o bulletin board types of announcements, such as meetings and activities for civic clubs, hobby clubs, lodges, professional and fraternal organizations, unions, business clubs, charities, fund raising, etc.; and     o profanity and loud background noise.             6.  Operations for Critical Events . For the designated service area, it is critical to broadcast as soon as possible  all  watches, warnings and related statements for:             o severe weather, floods, flash floods, and tsunamis;     o urgent marine information; and      o any non-weather civil emergency messages (as per agreements with state and local authorities) affecting the designated service area.              These products should seldom be modified for broadcast over NWR other than to:             o form complete sentences (if necessary);     o include appropriate punctuation; and     o eliminate:     -- naming of counties/areas outside the service area;     -- material that is relevant only to areas outside the service area; and     -- generic calls to action if calls to action are included elsewhere in the broadcast program.             6.1  Backup Live Mode . NWR transmitters are designed to shut down if there is no continuous audio feed within a predetermined amount of time, typically 10 to 20 seconds. In the event of catastrophic failure of any of the playback functions of the NWR system during a potentially life-threatening emergency, the senior official on duty at the WFO has the discretion to keep the transmitter on the air and provide a minimum-level warning service in backup live mode.             6.2  Role of NWR in the National Warning System (NAWAS) . The role of NWR in support of national defense is covered in detail in appendix E. The role of NWR as part of the ""all hazards"" emergency broadcast network is detailed in sections 6.3 and 6.4.             6.3  Initial Issuance of Watches, Warnings, and Related Statements . All pertinent watches and warnings valid for the NWR service area shall be broadcast immediately upon issuance. Initial broadcasts of certain watches and warnings for the NWR service area shall be preceded by the NWR-SAME codes and the     1050 Hz warning alarm tones. Other watches, warnings, and certain related follow-up statements may be preceded by the codes and alarms at RH option. See appendix F for details. Numbers and plotting points for convective watches should not be mentioned. The procedures for initial broadcasts of these messages are described below.             Initial Watch/Warning Broadcast Procedures .             a. Transmission of the NWR-SAME codes followed by the 1050 Hz alarm tone.             b. Broadcast the watch/warning information. This information may be abbreviated to suit certain customer needs, but the more detailed information should then follow without the codes and alarms.  When in manual mode , to minimize any lag time between issuance and broadcast of a  short-fuse warning , it is recommended to broadcast the initial warning  live .             c. Repeat highlights (i.e., what, where and when).             d. NWR-SAME end-of-message code.             Certain short-fuse warnings for counties/parishes/areas just outside the NWR service area may be broadcast with the NWR-SAME codes, as per local agreement, but the warning alarm tone shall not be used.             6.4  Programming After Initial Watch/Warning Issuances . Most public watches and warnings should be highlighted or summarized in the service area forecasts or optional regional forecasts as outlined in Exhibit C-64-1. However, separate messages should be used for details of hurricane warnings and short-fuse warnings for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods.             As threatening weather gets closer to the service area or when conditions become more hazardous, temporarily eliminate less essential parts of the broadcast program to allow additional time for watch, warning, or special/severe weather statement information.             If time permits, generic safety rules and call to action statements appropriate to the hazard should be included in the programming as separate messages when watches or warnings are in effect. Prerecorded messages should be kept in the NWR system database.     The remaining subsections provide guidance on how programming should be conducted during specific hazardous events. Within these subsections, the term ""regional area"" means beyond the service area to around 300 miles or so from the NWR station. ""Nearby"" means only locations in the regional area adjoining the official NWR service area. Exhibit C-64-1 provides a tabular summary of the guidelines in the following subsections of 6.4 for handling critical NWR information. Note that ""limited"" program status means to confine the material to information appropriate to the hazard and eliminate some basic or special customer programming.                     6.4.1  Watches for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods . After the initial watch message is aired, information on watches for the NWR service area should be highlighted in the service area forecast and/or included in a separate message.             6.4.2  Warnings for Tornadoes, Severe Thunderstorms, and Flash Floods . If any updated severe weather/flash flood statements are issued after initial broadcast of these warnings, they should replace the warning message and briefly  restate  the essential basics of the warning (what, where, when) followed by the new information concerning that event. A summary message containing up-to-date information on all existing watches, warnings, and advisories in the area may be used but requires up-to-the-minute currency of all information.             In the case when multiple warnings are in effect, limit call to action statements to only the most appropriate to avoid repetition.             6.4.3  Winter Storm, High Wind, and Dust Storm Watches and Warnings . Information for these watches and warnings should be highlighted in the service area forecast and/or summarized in the optional regional forecast and/or included in a separate message. If a separate watch or warning message is broadcast, it should be modified to eliminate conflicting or redundant information or information not useful for listeners in the service area.             6.4.4  Hurricane and Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings .      The latest hurricane local statement (edited for brevity, as necessary) should be broadcast along with any additional information from the latest National Hurricane Center (NHC) public advisory not contained in the hurricane local statement. The NHC forecast advisory should not be broadcast due to its lengthy and detailed nature. Cumulative probabilities through      72 hours should be indicated for locations within the service area as authorized in Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter C-41, Tropical Cyclone Program. Watches and warnings should also be highlighted in the service area forecast.             During warnings, the programming should be limited to: separate warning message with the advisory, service area forecast, short term forecast, tracking, and conditions in the weather roundup, safety rules, or any hurricane local statement.             6.4.5  Marine Warnings and Other Marine Events . This section contains instructions for the broadcasts of marine information.             a.  Special Marine Warnings and Follow-up Statements . Information for each event in the service area should be broadcast as a separate message. See section 6.4.2 for suggested updating procedures.             b.  Other Marine Weather Warnings . All other marine warnings, weather-related statements, and advisories that apply to a WFO's marine forecast area should be broadcast (see      appendix C).             c.  Special/Urgent Marine Information . In the interest of marine safety and at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) or other appropriate authority as designated by RH, NWS offices should broadcast information dealing with an emergency marine situation where: (1) life and/or property is imminently threatened, and (2) such information could help prevent further losses. The USCG should deliver the information ready for broadcast (without editing by the NWS). The USCG has responsibility for selecting messages that are within the appropriate NWR listening range. The effective coverage of the NWR stations shall be furnished to the USCG as requested. This can be done by any WFO that has the information.             No more than 30 to 40 seconds (about 70 words) should be made available for these messages. The broadcast should remain in the programming until the message is updated (normally 2 to 3 hours) or until the message is canceled by the USCG. The maximum time these messages should be broadcast is 12 hours. These messages should not replace any routine weather products broadcast over NWR. The following message format is suggested:             ""The following emergency marine information is transmitted at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard.... An oil tanker and freighter have collided at the entrance to the Puget Sound between Ft. Warden and Ft. Casey. The channel is blocked and oil covers much of the water surface in the area. All mariners are requested to stay clear of the area.""             In the event NWS priorities require temporary suspension of the USCG broadcast or a station emergency prevents the NWS from broadcasting the message, the NWS should notify the requesting USCG office of the situation as soon as possible.             6.4.6  Flood Watches and Warnings . Flood watches, warnings and related statements for the service area should be detailed in a separate message. They may be summarized in the service area forecast or optional regional forecast. This information for nearby areas may also be broadcast if it is important to listeners in the service area.              6.4.7  Tsunami Watches and Warnings . When these bulletins apply to the service area, they should be broadcast as a separate message using only the predictions for the service area. Because of rapidly changing water levels associated with a tsunami,  DO NOT  broadcast local water level observations.              Broadcasting information on evacuation over NWR is only permitted when prior arrangements have been made with local disaster preparedness authorities to receive the information in a timely fashion. If there are no such arrangements, the following statement should be read at the end of a tsunami warning issued by the Pacific or Alaska Tsunami Warning Centers.             ""Due to rapidly changing conditions associated with tsunami wave activity, listeners are urged to tune to local Emergency Alert System media for the latest information issued by local disaster preparedness authorities. They will provide details on evacuation of low-lying areas, if that is necessary, and when it is safe to return after the tsunami threat has passed.""             The source of evacuation information should be given.             6.5  Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages . This section contains special procedures for non-weather-related emergency information on a national, regional, and local basis. These messages should meet the requirements outlined in section 6.5.a and should be appropriately identified. The NWS has agreed to allow the use of the NWR service by other government agencies, on a highly selective basis, to broadcast potential life-saving messages. This is in keeping with expanding the function of NWR into an ""all hazards"" network. The lead-in to the non-NWS message should be as follows:             ""The following message is being transmitted at the request of  (OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY)  (remainder of text).""             Written agreements for non-NWS messages should exist for such broadcasts as indicated in subsection 6.5.b.             When NWR broadcasts contain information originating outside the NWS, the source of information shall be identified.             a.  Criteria for Broadcasting Non-Weather-Related Emergency Messages . These messages to be permitted on NWR should comply with all the following criteria.             o PUBLIC SAFETY IS INVOLVED--Information to be broadcast will aid in reducing the loss of life or the substantial loss of property.             o OFFICIAL INFORMATION--The source of the information should be a government agency, Federal, state, or local, whose information directly supports Federal responsibilities concerning the protection of life and property.             o TIME CRITICAL--Event requires immediate public knowledge to avoid adverse impact.             o Other means of disseminating the information are not adequate to ensure rapid delivery of urgent information of an immediate threat or of significant importance to life and property.             o Information length and format is consistent with other NWR broadcast program material. Inclusion of this information should not compromise the remaining NWR broadcast content.             o Information should be non-routine and infrequent.             o Information contributes to the NWS warning program through increased customer awareness.             o Information tends to increase the NWR listenership.             b.  Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Covered by Agreement . As a general rule, there is only one statewide agreement with one agency to cover all the anticipated situations. Copies of these agreements and detailed procedures to carry out the agreements should be kept near the weather radio operations area. Agreements to broadcast non-weather emergency information (including possible use of the warning alarm tones and NWR-SAME codes) shall be approved by the RH.             c.  Local Non-Weather-Related Emergencies Not Covered by Agreement . At times when events occur requiring the use of NWR by outside sources that are not covered by any agreements, the senior official on duty should determine if the event presents a clear and immediate threat to lives and property in the listening area. If the official determines that the threat to life and property is real and the use of NWR could reduce the threat, these broadcasts, as requested by locally recognized public safety officials, should be authorized. The authority is not to be extended to develop or promote any unofficial or nonapproved agreements. If time permits, the RH should be contacted before the broadcast is made. If time does not permit, the RH should be contacted as soon as possible afterward with details of the event. Examples of situations that would fall under this category are (1) a serious chemical spill or leak,      (2) an explosion in a populated area, or (3) a dangerous nuclear release.             d.  National and Regional Non-Weather-Related Emergencies . The NWS, in support of FEMA, should disseminate emergency messages over the NWR, including but not limited to, attack warnings and large-scale non-weather-related events, such as earthquakes and volcanic activity. The dissemination procedures for national and regional non-weather-related emergency messages are described in detail in appendix E.             6.6  Required Weekly Test (RWT) . The public alarm tone and NWR-SAME test code features of NWR shall be activated for test purposes each Wednesday between 10 a.m. and noon local time, except when severe weather is ongoing or threatening. At regional discretion, WFOs may broadcast the required weekly test additionally at certain other times (e.g., evening prime time) to suit stated customer needs and within office capabilities. WFOs should not broadcast the required weekly test using automated scheduling unless there is a specific procedure for ensuring the test does not inadvertently broadcast during threatening weather.             Immediately after transmitting the appropriate NWR-SAME codes and tones, the following message shall be broadcast (it may be shortened, at WFO option, except counties/parishes/areas must be provided).             ""This is the National Weather Service Office in  city  . The preceding signal was a test of the Weather Radio Station  LLL-NN's  public warning system. During potentially dangerous weather situations, specially built receivers can be automatically activated by this signal to warn of the impending hazard. Tests of this signal and receivers' performance are normally conducted by the National Weather Service at  time  each  day of the week  . If there is a threat of severe weather, the test will be postponed to the next available good-weather day. Reception of this broadcast, and especially the warning alarm tone, will vary at any given location. This variability, normally more noticeable at greater distances from the transmitter, can occur even though you are using a good quality receiver in good working order. The warning alarm tone will be activated for hazardous watches and warnings for the following counties  list of counties/parishes/independent cities, or other designated areas  . This concluded the weekly test of Weather Radio Station .""             Where more than one state is involved, the state name shall always precede the names of the counties in that state.             If, for any reason, the test was missed during the scheduled time frame, then the next test should not take place until about      24 hours later on the next available good-weather day.             As part of the weekly test, those transmitters whose broadcast cannot be heard at the WFO and have an operating ROAMS should be checked for audio quality. This is done by placing a telephone call to the ROAMS unit and requesting to monitor the broadcast audio.              6.7  Drills of Broadcast Procedures for Critical Events . Each WFO shall establish procedures for conducting and documenting periodic drills in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8 and appendix B.             It is suggested that the required weekly tests be conducted live through on-air or recorded emergency override, or through backup live. These types of tests will afford the staff an excellent opportunity to obtain experience in the event they have to use the emergency override or backup live function of the NWR system.             7.  Broadcast Outage and Suspension Procedures . This section covers various aspects of these procedures.     7.1  Notice of NWR Facility Outage . In the event of an NWR facility outage that has been planned at least 24 hours in advance, a brief message should be broadcast periodically during the 24-hour period prior to the outage. Planned outages that are scheduled to occur in less than 24 hours should be immediately broadcast and frequently repeated. For example:             ""NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-75, Des Moines, Iowa, will be off the air for maintenance from 10 a.m., Wednesday, until about 9 a.m., Thursday.""             Include the estimated time of return if it can be determined. Avoid such terms as ""Thursday morning"" or ""Monday night.""             When NWR equipment is taken off the air or unplanned outages occur, a message should be sent over the NOAA Weather Wire Service (NWWS) or the local NWS telephone recording system, if feasible.             When interference with other agencies requires temporary suspension of NWR broadcasts, a brief message should be aired over the NWR just prior to the suspension. A sample message follows:             ""NOAA Weather Radio station KHB-36, Washington, D.C., will be off the air from 7 a.m. until 3 p.m., Thursday, because of technical difficulties. If weather warnings are required during the period, NOAA Weather Radio will resume broadcasts as soon as possible.""             An additional message also should be sent over NWWS and the local telephone recording system. The following is an example of a suggested message that may be used on the NWWS to advise subscribers of the NWR outage.             Example :             WBCPNSWBC     TTAA00 KWBC 161330             PUBLIC INFORMATION STATEMENT     NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WASHINGTON DC     830 AM EST TUE MAR 16 1999             NOAA WEATHER RADIO KHB-36 WASHINGTON DC WILL BE OFF THE AIR DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FROM 10 AM TODAY...TUESDAY...     UNTIL ABOUT 9 AM WEDNESDAY. IF WEATHER WARNINGS ARE REQUIRED DURING THE PERIOD..NOAA WEATHER RADIO WILL RESUME BROADCASTS AT ONCE.             Regardless whether the outage is planned or unplanned, if it is expected to be for more than 12 hours, notify the RH. If the station goes off in an emergency or potentially threatening situation, notify the RH as quickly as time will allow.             7.2  Broadcast Suspension Procedures . State, local, and other Federal agencies use frequencies near the NWR band. On occasion, these agencies (e.g., Treasury, Forest Service) will temporarily move into an NWR service area with a mobile radio system to cope with a highly critical situation. When interference is caused to another emergency radio system, the NWS will cooperate in the elimination of the radio interference with the following procedures.             7.2.1  Routine Request .             a. Designated personnel of an agency involved in a critical operation should first establish, by ""on-off"" short duration tests with the local NWR involved, that the interference is actually a result of NWR.             b. If it is established that the interference can be eliminated by the temporary shutdown of an NWR station, the designated contact for that agency should request a temporary shutdown for that station. This request should be directed to WSH.             c. WSH should notify the appropriate RH of the need for the NWR shutdown. The RH, in turn, should inform the local office. The local office should not suspend operations in the absence of such notification.             Any office that has been requested to temporarily shut down, under the above procedures, has the authority to continue operations or to immediately resume the broadcast operations during actual or imminent severe weather, flood, or other disasters. NWR offices should inform the RH when this situation arises, and RH should relay that information to WSH.             7.2.2  Emergency Request . These instructions can only provide guidance for anticipated interference conditions; not all situations can be anticipated. When interference is caused to another emergency radio system (i.e., fire trucks, ambulance, etc.) and no severe weather is occurring or imminent, suspension of the NWR broadcasts is authorized by the WFO. The RH shall be notified as soon as possible.             7.2.3  Fire and Bomb Threats . When an NWR office must evacuate due to a bomb threat, fire, hazardous material incident, or other hazard, a short message should be added to the broadcast program if time permits. For example, ""Updates will not be available until further notice."" Never announce the office is being evacuated due to a bomb threat or fire.             8.  Quality Assurance . The primary responsibility for maintaining the quality of NWR broadcasts rests with the WFO and the RH. The RH should investigate the options available for training to maintain high broadcast quality. Quality assurance at the local office should consist of on-shift monitoring and active participation of an NWR program leader as described below. See also appendix B for information on training and practice requirements to assure proficiency.              8.1  Quality Assurance on Shift . The broadcast programming should be monitored frequently during the shift to ensure the information is timely, complete, consistent, accurate, and of clear audio quality. For those transmitters out of broadcast range of the WFO, the audio quality should be checked using the NWR system monitoring function and ROAMS. Actual broadcast audio from the transmitter should be checked once a week as part of the required weekly test (see section 6.5). Also, each person placing a message in the broadcast program should review the product, including text proofing, and evaluate the new product's impact on the total program before broadcasting it.             See appendix H for identification of NWR system problems by ROAMS and the appropriate responses by WFO personnel.             8.2  NWR Program Leaders . WFOs should have an NWR program leader(s) who will:             a. ensure manuals, handbooks, and logs are kept up-to-date and all NWR operators are familiar with current operating instructions and techniques for preventive maintenance;             b. see that adequate NWR supplies are maintained;             c. carry out any NWR-related duties assigned by the WFO management;             d. assist the NWR system focal point (if not the same person) in the programming and maintenance of the NWR system;              e. ensure educational and promotional materials are adequate and up-to-date (see section 12); and             f. assist WFO management in the NWR Operator Proficiency Program, as described in appendix B.             9.  NWR as a Substitute for Other Means of Dissemination . WFO management should be alert to situations where NWR broadcasts can be used to lighten the total dissemination workload of the office. NWR broadcasts may be used to reduce the number and variety of manual telephone recordings, as well as reduce the number of incoming telephone calls to the office.             10.  Use of NWR by the Electronic Media . The FCC has permitted AM, FM, TV, and cable TV broadcast stations to rebroadcast NWR transmissions. Appendix G is a copy of the FCC release to broadcasters which specifies the conditions placed on the blanket rebroadcast authority. The same conditions apply to rebroadcasts of NWR on amateur radio. Note that since the release was issued in 1978, four additional broadcast frequencies have been authorized (see section 2.c).             The rebroadcast of NWR programming is encouraged for cable TV systems and TV stations whose areal coverage coincides with the NWR service area. For cable TV systems and TV stations that extend well beyond the NWR listening range, rebroadcasts are discouraged since most material will not apply, particularly the warnings.             An important function of the NWR is to serve as the NWS's primary entry into the EAS through the use of NWR-SAME technology, which has the same communications protocols as the EAS. NWS at the national, regional, and WFO levels should continue to work closely with their respective electronic media and emergency management partners to assure the success of the EAS. WFOs, along with their EAS partners, should be involved in the creation of state and local EAS plans. See appendix F for details on NWS policy regarding the use of the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone and authorized NWR-SAME codes on NWR broadcast messages.             For information on providing commercial and public TV and radio stations with direct access to the audio output of NWR, see WSOM Chapter G-21, NOAA Weather Radio, which includes sample agreement forms.             11.  Restrictions Under Operating License . The NWS is licensed to operate individual NWRs through the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC). This Federal committee is chaired by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the DOC. IRAC controls NWS operations in the same way the FCC does for commercial and other non-Federal groups and organizations. Each NWR license is granted for a particular power setting and frequency at a specific site. The power, frequency, or location of an NWR station cannot be changed without prior IRAC approval.             12.  Public Education and Promotion . To be fully effective, NWR must employ a continuing program of public education. This program should involve the efforts of the NOAA Office of Public Affairs, WSH, RH, and WFOs.             Further information on promoting NWR can be found in the ""NOAA Weather Radio 2000, Console Replacement System Outreach Guide"" and ""The NWS NOAA Weather Radio Promotional Guide for a New Century."" Substantial publicity also is being garnered through public and private announcements about the ongoing expansion of NWR programming through placement of new transmitters throughout the country in partnership with external groups. The Office of Public Affairs at the national and regional levels, in coordination with OM and OSO, plays a significant role in these promotional efforts. This is particularly true in regard to written materials, such as press releases and brochures, and any audio or video ""spots"" for commercial broadcast. Much information on NWR for the public and NWS personnel is available on the Internet. Two Web sites of particular interest are:             http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr      http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa.             12.1  General Promotion Activities . WFOs are encouraged to promote NWR. Promotions should highlight the warning alarm and NWR-SAME code features and the value of NWR to schools, hospitals, industrial centers, and homes. Potential NWR ownership and listenership also should be promoted through outreach activities at conventions, fairs, boat shows, and other gatherings at the local, regional, and national levels. Pursue personal contacts where necessary in dealing with special customer groups and business groups promoting the sales of NWR receivers, especially those with seven channels.              NOAA/NWS Public Affairs has a Web site listing many ideas that have been successful over the years. A list of these ideas is available at:              http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa/secnews/nwr/101ideas.htm.             NOAA and King Features Syndicate have an agreement allowing for use of the Mark Trail comic strip character as a campaign symbol for promoting NOAA Weather Radio. NWS personnel should contact their Regional NOAA/NWS Public Affairs Officer for guidance on using the Mark Trail image in specific campaigns.             WSH has developed and periodically updated brochures that are available from the National Logistics Supply Center in Kansas City, Missouri. Pop-up displays are available from OSO's NWR Program Office.             The RH will assist local offices in obtaining NWR exhibits for use in increasing public awareness. WFOs are encouraged      to distribute maps showing the NWR coverage area; these handouts might include information about the NWR service. Other awareness avenues may include newspaper and the telephone.             A sample listing in the newspaper for the weather section or radio station listing section might be as follows:             WEATHER RADIO             For 24-hour NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts, tune to      162.--- MHz.             Brief NWR promotion messages can be placed on the office forecast-recorder phone or Internet Home page. An example of such a message might be as follows.             ""Because of high public interest in weather, you may be unable to reach this number (or Internet Home page) during active weather situations. You may wish to tune in to our NOAA Weather Radio station on 162.--- MHz to receive the latest weather information broadcast continuously from this office. Consult your radio sales outlet to select a suitable receiver.""             Another means of promoting NWR is to use NWR as ""audio"" whenever the office telephones are placed ""on-hold.""             12.2  Promotion with Electronic Media . WFOs should continue to cultivate positive relations with local electronic media with the goal of timely and direct rebroadcasts of NWR-SAME-coded emergency messages via EAS facilities to the public. (Further information on EAS and NWR-SAME is available in section 10 and appendix F.) In addition, WFOs should continue to encourage electronic media facilities to rebroadcast more of the NWR broadcasts outside of the EAS arena, including follow-up statements and other supporting forecasts. As examples, some television stations do this via the Secondary Audio Programming (SAP) technology, where people can tune modern televisions sets to the SAP to hear the information. Some cable television facilities use NWR rebroadcasts as a ""voice-over,"" along with radar or other graphics. These efforts should be expanded, where possible.             13.  Customer Surveys . From time to time, WFOs should make on-air requests for comments and suggestions from the listening audience. Surveys such as these are encouraged and should prove helpful in determining usefulness of the broadcast service and current broadcast scheduling. Summaries of the survey results should be sent to the RH. Plans to conduct a survey should be coordinated with the RH.             14.  Gift/Cooperator-Operated NWR Systems . The basic NWR network funded by the Federal Government was completed in the early 1980s. Because the completed network did not reach every community in the United States, local and state governments, private companies, and various civic groups can help establish complete new NWR stations or expand service areas by purchasing supplemental transmitters. This is in keeping with the overall NWR expansion goal of the NWS, as outlined in section 1.1. WSOM Chapter G-21 provides specific information on these efforts, including agreement forms for donated equipment.              OFFICE OF TELECOMMUNICATION POLICY (OTP)          EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT          WASHINGTON, DC 20504                  January 13, 1975                  NATIONAL POLICY FOR THE USE OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS          TO WARN THE GENERAL PUBLIC                  Policy Statement                     In November 1971, the Federal Government completed a review of national policies and programs for use of telecommunications to provide the American public with warning of an enemy attack or of natural disasters. It was established at that time, in a statement of national policy respecting home warning systems, that the acquisition and use of any warning receiver should be a voluntary decision by each citizen. Studies conducted since 1971 now have led the Government to update and reaffirm that policy.             It now has been established that in addition to the voluntary use of a warning receiver, the public interest would be served best by a single, Government-operated system for warning citizens in their homes of enemy attack or natural disaster. In this regard, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio will be the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public.             The 1971 OTP policy statement committed the Federal Government to pursuing a program that would ""establish a rapid, reliable warning capability, and...bring the cost of a warning receiver within the reach of every American citizen."" To this end, a series of tests and studies were initiated to explore several proposed home warning systems and market demands for home receivers. During 1974, the results of these studies were reviewed by the Warning Steering Committee, an interagency group chaired by the Office of Telecommunications Policy, and including representatives of NOAA, the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (DCPA), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Office of Preparedness (OP), and the Department of Transportation (DOT).             The studies focused primarily on two alternative home warning systems. The first is the Decision Information Distribution System (DIDS) of the Department of Defense. Designed originally for enemy attack warning, its scope could be expanded to include warning citizens of natural disasters. The system is in the experimental stage. The second system is the National Weather Service's (NWS) VHF/FM Tone Alert System. (The NWS is an agency of NOAA.) This system already is operational for weather forecasting and incorporates a special tone alert signal permitting receivers to be activated automatically  if desired by the owner .              After analyzing these studies, OTP concluded that the NOAA system is the choice for priority expansion and will serve as the single national home warning system. The reasons for this are:             (1) It provides routine daily weather services, tailored to local areas, thereby enhancing the marketability of receivers;             (2) Federal investment required to complete coverage of most populated areas will be much less than the investment required to complete the DIDS transmitting system, and can be accomplished much sooner; and             (3) Inexpensive commercial receivers for this system are already on the market.             The development of alternative systems, if allowed to continue unchecked, could result not only in a needless proliferation of home warning systems but could also effectively split the market for receivers because of different technologies, which, in turn, might keep the cost of receivers so high as to be a serious obstacle to widespread voluntary purchase. Therefore, in order to avoid duplication, public confusion and unnecessary future financial burden on the public (as consumers and taxpayers), the NOAA Weather Radio will be the only federally sponsored radio transmission of warning information to receivers optionally available to the general public. Other systems such as the DIDS should no longer be considered candidates for this function.             The market demand studies for home receivers indicated that many citizens would voluntarily purchase receivers capable of receiving home warning (if one were available), but that the total number of households with such receivers would not--for the foreseeable future--constitute a majority of the population. Therefore, this policy recognizes that Government-operated home warning systems, with purchase of the receiver on a voluntary basis, can only supplement other existing warning systems.             The Warning Steering Committee, chaired by the OTP, will coordinate efforts for the use of telecommunications for warning dissemination to attain a consolidated national warning capability. In support of this effort, NOAA and DCPA will develop necessary plans to use the NOAA Weather Radio as a supplementary attack warning system and will further develop plans and procedures to incorporate the civil defense siren systems into the consolidated warning system, as well as to maximize the provision of warning information to radio and television stations.             NOAA WEATHER RADIO (NWR)     OPERATOR PROFICIENCY PROGRAM                     Purpose : The purpose of this appendix is to emphasize the requirement that all NWS operational personnel at the WFOs must be proficient at disseminating warnings, watches, and advisories via the NWR system, including NWR-SAME, and any backup broadcast systems. Operational personnel include the Meteorologist in Charge, senior and general forecasters, Hydrometeorological Technicians (HMTs), Meteorological Interns, Service Hydrologists, Science Operations Officers (SOOs), Data Acquisition Program Managers (DAPMs), and Warning Coordination Meteorologists (WCMs).             Background : A critical mission of the NWS is the issuance of warnings, watches, and advisories for the protection of life and property. The prompt and efficient issuance of these products via NWR and the EAS provides a far-reaching and effective warning/alert system to the American citizen. Hence, all NWS operational personnel at NWR sites shall be proficient at providing this warning dissemination service.             Regional Headquarters (RH) : RHs shall have responsibility for the oversight of an NWR operator proficiency program in their region. This program will include an annual report from each WFO management to their RH. It will assure that each operational employee performed practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuances at sufficient intervals to demonstrate their ability to disseminate, in an operationally effective period of time, watches, warnings, advisories, and other appropriate messages over the NWR broadcast system(s) at their office. The report shall contain sufficient detail, as described in the following section, to accurately document the steps taken to confirm this capability. Each RH shall maintain this documentation on file for a period of five (5) years.              Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) : All operational employees shall perform practice or real-time NWR/EAS warning issuance on their the NWR system and any backup NWR broadcast systems no less than quarterly, and at other random times determined by the WFO management. These practice sessions shall be clearly indicated as such during broadcast. For the NWR system, this shall include correct and time-efficient usage of its Emergency Override function, Backup Live function with an NWR-SAME encoder, and Weather Message Creation function to disseminate an NWS warning.             One of these practice sessions per year shall be for the official record and be monitored by a local trainer (SOO, WCM, DAPM, or NWR Program Leader) for proper procedures and time effectiveness. Once a year, as determined by each region, the WFO management shall document in writing to their RH that all quarterly practice sessions have been successfully completed by all operational employees, including the date(s) of the monitored NWR/EAS warning issuance. The WFO management shall describe other actions taken throughout the year to ensure the proficiency of the office staff to effectively operate NWR in critical event situations, such as watches, warnings, and advisories.             At the time of issuance of this appendix to WSOM Chapter C-64, the FCC has not yet approved use of a planned demonstration code, a code specifically designed for use with practice EAS broadcasts. Until this code is approved, these exercises must be confined to the time of the manually produced NWR tone alarm/RWT (EAS Required Weekly Test), or confined to 1 DMO (practice demonstration code) issuance per day per NWR broadcast service area. Upon FCC approval of the unrestricted use of the DMO code, the exercises may be conducted at any time in accordance with WFO policy/procedure, ensuring that each practice broadcast is clearly indicated as such, and performed only during times of non-threatening weather. At that time, a quarterly practice session may be substituted by a routine weekly test but shall not be a substitute for a monitored yearly test by the local NWR trainer.             GUIDELINES FOR BASIC CORE AND     SPECIAL CUSTOMER MESSAGES                     Basic Core Messages . Basic core messages are those that are to be repeated, often as a set, on a frequent basis. Except for the brief station I.D., these messages may be deleted or cut as appropriate when warnings are in effect within the service area. This set of core messages should normally be programmed in the following order.             a.  Station I.D . A brief station identification should appear with each repetition of the core broadcast. It should include the call sign, general service area, programming office and, if necessary, attribution information. This may be necessary at sites where free tower rent is provided, but the tower owner requires frequent attribution. At least one version of the I.D. should contain a reference to NWR as the voice of the NWS. Two examples follow:             ""This is NOAA Weather Radio station KEC-74, serving central Indiana and originating from the National Weather Service Office in Indianapolis.""             ""You are listening to NOAA Weather Radio, the voice of the National Weather Service, serving western Washington and the adjacent coastal waters. KHB-60 Seattle and KIH-36 Neah Bay originate from the Weather Service Office in Seattle.""             A more detailed I.D. should be broadcast on a less frequent basis (i.e., once an hour) with appropriate attribution, frequency, and transmitter location and description of the service. The detailed I.D. should not be broadcast during critical event operations, only the brief I.D. Solicitations for feedback concerning NWR programming and scheduling can be included in the longer I.D.             b.  Synopsis and Optional Regional Forecast . Care should be taken to ensure these messages are broadcast frequently enough to avoid reference to time frames that may be surpassed before the issuance of a replacement message. For example, refrain from stating ""snow is expected over the Great Lakes by late morning..."" if the product will air past noon.             Synopsis ...The general synopsis should contain a discussion of weather systems that will be affecting the broadcast area during the valid forecast period. It should be very brief, in layman's terms and limited to highlighting only the most significant features. It should emphasize the first 48 hours and indicate pertinent information through the extended forecast periods. If marine messages are part of the core broadcast programming (see special customer messages section below), the marine synopsis may be used instead, provided it describes features affecting both marine and land areas in the broadcast service area.              Regional Forecast (optional) ...This is an optional overview of the weather beyond the broadcast service area for a multitude of uses, such as marine, travel, outdoor activities, construction, media rebroadcasts, etc. It normally should not exceed 1 minute in length. The region covered should include the area out to a radius of about 300 miles from the transmitter.             For brevity, the forecast portion should include information for no longer than the next 36 hours. Emphasis should be on problem areas associated with rain or snow, severely restricted visibility, and significant variations in temperature. A small number of larger city forecasts may be highlighted where there is a lot of listener need or interest. Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico may want to include weather to common destinations beyond the normal regional range (including mainland United States) or restrict the region to areas reachable by land. The latter would apply to U.S. coastal stations as well.             Information in the regional forecast for winter storm and high wind watches and warnings should be summarized with specific details avoided. Include specific information in other portions of the broadcasts.             Details on specific severe thunderstorm, tornado, flood, or flash flood watches should also be avoided in the regional forecast. Instead, language or terms should be used similar to the convective outlook with regard to the potential for severe convective weather and flash floods. Include specific watch and warning information for severe convective weather and flash flooding for the service area in other portions of the broadcast.              Information on hurricane/tropical storm watches and warnings should be given from the latest advisory. At a minimum, this would include the storm location and strength as well as the 24-hour forecast movement and strength. Local offices or RH should set policies or guidelines to broadcast such information for appropriate distances beyond the regional area.             Temperature forecasts should be general and need not be closer than 10 degree ranges. Discussions of current or past weather should not be mentioned unless it is relevant to the forecast conditions or will impact customers, such as those traveling into flooding or deep snow.             c.  Service Area Forecasts . The forecast should be for the entire service area, as covered in zone forecast product issuances, but with emphasis on conditions for the first      12 hours. The extended forecast modified for the service area also should be included but with more general information than the 1- to 2-day forecast. The service area forecast is usually the most important segment of the entire broadcast. The forecast issuance time should not be included. Short-fused warnings (e.g., for tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods) are excluded from this forecast since they are carried on a separate broadcast segment. Most other watches, warnings, and advisories should be highlighted. When convective outlooks for significant severe weather potential include the service area, the information should be integrated into the forecast usually within the first two forecast periods.             d.  Weather Roundups . The latest observations within the service area should be broadcast around-the-clock and shall be updated at least hourly. The roundup may also include observations or a summary of weather conditions adjacent to the service area out to a range of 100 to 300 miles. The time of the observations should be stated. Observed weather should be updated or removed from the core set of messages no later than      1 hour and 20 minutes after the valid time of last observation. If for any reason it becomes impossible to update this hourly, either through automation or manually, it should be cut from the broadcast until it can be updated.             Some observations taken at 2- to 3-hour intervals, such as marine, still may be of some value for a longer time. If they are included in later updates, the specific time of these observations should be stated.             e.  Short Term Forecast . This message is broadcast when the product is in effect and should consist of a brief forecast of expected conditions, typically in the next 1 to      3 hours. This message should be updated as frequently as possible during active weather to maintain freshness. See WSOM Chapter C-21, Local and Regional Statements, Summaries, and Tables, for details on the short term forecast.             Special Customer Messages . These messages are of interest to well-defined customer groups that make up a large part of the listening audience. In order to avoid redundancy, limit the parameters to those not included in other broadcast material. With the exception of marine forecasts and forecasts for rivers near or at flood levels, special customer messages should be scheduled in selected and limited time periods. Special customer messages may vary during the day, week, or season as audience needs change. For example, commercial fishermen are closely tuned to marine forecasts early in the morning prior to leaving port. Lake and river stages, recreational/resort forecasts, and any special event forecasts become more important as weekends approach and are often seasonal. Messages for special customers include:             a.  Marine Forecast . The coastal waters forecast or near-shore forecast should be programmed for  all  NWR stations listed on Marine Weather Service charts. Offshore marine forecast also may be broadcast depending on listener interest. Where marine interests are dominant, the marine forecasts may make up a large portion of the broadcast cycle, or even become the core broadcast. For instance, the concept of a ""marine hour"" may be addressed through scheduling of a marine suite. Landlocked NWRs with significant public interest in marine areas that are outside the NWR service area but reasonably accessible should schedule marine programming for peak periods, such as weekends, holidays, or during the summer. Weather information for inland lakes may be included in the NWR service area forecast or recreational/resort area forecast if it is not part of the marine forecast programming. Tidal information and water temperature may be included in marine programming.              b.  Climate Data . For a period of 1 to 3 hours every morning and evening, each station should broadcast a brief summary of the day's climate data. This information should take up less than 1 minute and should include high and low temperatures and precipitation. Data, such as degree days and normals, solar information, and record reports, may be broadcast but are not required. Statements summarizing the monthly climatic data, dry spells, or other timely features may be programmed as desired. Recommended local broadcast times are from around 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., depending on input from listener surveys, AWIPS issuance times, and local staffing considerations.             c.  Hydrologic Observations and Forecasts, Tide Data, and Water Temperature . Include this information when reasonably large streams, rivers, lakes, or coasts are in or near the service area according to customer needs. When a hazard exists, this message should be available continuously. Otherwise, this message should be broadcast in a limited time interval.             d.  Fire Weather Forecasts . Include this information only during the fire season and where major forest, brush, or grass fires are possible. If the forest is out of the service area, the information could be contained in the regional forecast. See WSOM Chapter D-06, Fire Weather Services.             e.  Air Quality Information . This information should be provided when pollution is above a critical safety level and the information is available from a local government agency.             f.  Recreational/Resort Area Forecasts . Limit these to areas where a significant percentage of the listeners are expected to go. These forecasts should describe, in general terms, weather events that will enhance or restrict activity. These forecasts may be incorporated in the regional forecast.             g.  Weather-Related Road Information . Include road condition reports when there are hazards (typically in winter) and when the reports are easily available with frequent updates from an official source. The data should be summarized and require little or no writing or editing by NWS personnel. If approved by the officials involved, telephone numbers of the official sources may be broadcast to aid motorists. The time and source of the report should be included in the broadcast.             Example :             ""AT 11:00 AM THE IOWA STATE POLICE REPORT INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS AND MAJOR US ROUTES WEST OF...ARE....""             h.  Ultraviolet Index (UVI) Forecasts . WFOs that have UVI forecast sites within their NWR broadcast service area(s) are responsible for broadcasting those UVI values on the appropriate NWR transmitters. These values should be broadcast generally from early April to the end of September. These start and stop dates may be adjusted at RH/WFO discretion depending on local climatic factors and customer needs. See Operations Manual Letter 4-95, Ultraviolet Index Forecasts, section 3.2, or any superseding policy directive for further operational instructions.                     NWR SYSTEM     BASIC TERMS AND DEFINITIONS     RELATED TO BROADCAST SCHEDULING                     (Weather) Messages :  The most important unit of information that the NWR system handles.  A message consists of two parts: the message header (i.e., the message attributes including the message identifier) and the message content (i.e., information intended for broadcast). Messages may be live voice, digitized voice, or ASCII text. They may be input directly at the NWR system (by microphone or from floppy disk) or from an external source (i.e., Automation of Field Operations and Services [AFOS], AWIPS).                     Message Type : Names of messages. The NWR system uses message types as analogous to AFOS PILs, i.e., contains information in nine characters about the node origination site (source of the message), the product category (e.g., severe weather statement), and the specific product designator. Essentially the same as AFOS PILs but only restricted to AFOS PILs while AFOS is the NWR system's sole communication source.                     Broadcast Suite : A list of message types that are eligible to be broadcast when that suite is active. Categorized by ""General,"" ""High,"" and ""Exclusive,"" these are ascending orders of program urgency relating to restricted message types in the suite. (More about this under Scheduling.)                     Broadcast Program : Each suite is assigned to a program, and there will be multiple suites assigned to a single program. These programs are then assigned to a specific transmitter and result in the broadcast itself.                     Backup Live:  Condition of operation if the NWR system has failed. Allows direct human-to-transmitter dissemination of information through bypassing the failed NWR system.                     Emergency Override:  Operation used when the NWR system is working, but an emergency situation exists that requires immediate human access to the transmitter. Cuts off current broadcast for the operator to ""go live"" with emergency information. These ""live"" messages can be recorded for subsequent insertion into the ongoing broadcast program.                     NWR System Identifier:  A numeric field contained within the Message Reference Descriptor (MRD), used to identify messages for purposes of replacement or output ordering. ( This is different from the 9-letter ID defined as message type.)                     Listening Area Codes : Also known as LACs, these are essentially Universal Geographic Codes renamed to identify their specific use by the NWR system. It is a code that identifies geopolitical areas (e.g., NWS defined zones, counties, parts of counties, and even independent cities) to which a message applies.                     MRD:  Message Reference Descriptor. One of the attributes required to uniquely identify messages in the NWR system. Used ultimately to determine whether a message should be replaced or not.                     Periodicity : Messages may be scheduled so they are inserted at specific time intervals. This time interval set between times of broadcast is the periodicity. (""Weather on the Eights,"" for instance, refers to the message recurring every 10 minutes, at 08, 18, 28, 38, 48, and 58 minutes after the hour, or having a  periodicity  of 10 minutes.)                     Broadcast Cycle : The broadcast cycle can be considered as the core set of messages currently playing, including those playing sequentially and those playing periodically. From the AMPRO analogy, those tapes that are playing, from Digital or Interalia those ""bins"" that are playing beginning with the first and ending with the last. On the NWR system, the broadcast cycle is depicted as inclusive of those message types listed on the broadcast cycle screen. Broadcast cycle length is the length of time it takes to broadcast all of those messages.                     Manual Operations : Use of the NWR system for manually recording and scheduling messages rather than using automated text-to-voice capability.                             DISSEMINATION PROCEDURES FOR     NATIONAL AND REGIONAL     NON-WEATHER-RELATED EMERGENCY MESSAGES                     NON-WEATHER-RELATED NATIONAL OR REGIONAL HAZARDS             These procedures shall be used to disseminate messages from authorized organizations for non-weather-related hazards affecting the Nation or large regions of the country normally consisting of several states or territories. These would include, but are not limited to, nuclear attack, earthquakes, tsunamis, terrorist attack, etc. The details of these instructions outlined here will be amended occasionally by replacing this appendix to account for changes in NWS communications systems, such as AFOS being replaced by AWIPS, as the NWR system matures, and as new NWR-SAME and EAS codes are developed by FEMA, FCC, and NWS. The basic concept, however, should not be affected by these changes.             A.  Initial Dissemination .             (1) Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the title of the WARNING message.             (2) The regional warnings centers or other authorized alternate emergency operation centers (which normally operate in these types of situations) acknowledge to the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations). (Note for FEMA personnel reading this directive: ""Activate the warning signal"" means to transmit the appropriate NWR-SAME/EAS code and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tone to activate NWR receivers.)             (3) NWS offices shall prepare the appropriate message for dissemination. If the message is:             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK : Get the red-bordered envelope containing the approved text for this specific type of hazard. The text of the message on this card may be prerecorded and stored on a diskette with the diskette sealed along with the card in the red-bordered envelope. THE TEXT OF THIS MESSAGE, HOWEVER, SHALL, UNDER NO CONDITIONS, BE RECORDED AND STORED AS A FILE ON THE NWR SYSTEM OR ANY OTHER ON-LINE NWR MESSAGING SYSTEM PRIOR TO ITS ACTUAL USE IN A REAL EVENT. DO NOT leave the envelope out in the open. The NWS must eliminate the possibility of a false or accidental ATTACK WARNING.             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARDS : Obtain the text of the message by either copying or recording it from the NAWAS. If the message is obtained from another authorized source, such as AWIPS, AFOS, or FAX, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation.             (4) Until updated with a more specific event code, select the NWR-SAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message (CEM) to disseminate these types of messages along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode for some reason. Suspend all normal broadcast operations and cause the NWR to send the code followed by the public warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the warning alarm tone, immediately begin  READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN .             (5) The message should be read live and recorded. An alternative is to play the message from the prerecorded diskette. Following transmission of the NWR-SAME/EAS End-Of-Message, immediately program the NWR for this message and a short station identification to play indefinitely until manually replaced with another message. If the WFO will be evacuated, broadcast a recurring short message informing listeners that the WFO will not provide any service until further notice. Do NOT mention that the office has been evacuated.             (NOTE: When a new event code is established for this specific type of message, offices should investigate the creation of a special high priority product suite that will be activated when a message is broadcast with this specific code.)             B.  Termination .             (1) Following a 7-second ring on NAWAS, the National Warning Center or its authorized alternate will announce the termination of the specific hazard WARNING as follows.             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK :             ""ATTENTION ALL STATIONS, THIS IS THE NATIONAL WARNING CENTER. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. REPEAT. THE ATTACK WARNING IS TERMINATED. WARNING CENTERS ACKNOWLEDGE.""             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD : A similar type of statement to that in B(1)a. will be read on NAWAS. If a message is sent by another authorized source, such as AWIPS, AFOS, or FAX, use the state or nationally established method of confirmation.             (2) The regional warning centers or other authorized alternate emergency operations centers (which normally operate in these types of situations) acknowledge to the National Warning Center. The state warning points then acknowledge. The state warning points will then request acknowledgment from locations on the state warning circuits (including NWS locations).             (3) Following acknowledgment to the appropriate warning centers or as soon as the NWS office is again occupied, NWS offices shall disseminate these types of cancellation messages. Until updated with a more specific event cancellation code, select the NWR-SAME/EAS code for Civil Emergency Message along with ALL the appropriate geographic codes available on the NWR system or NWR-SAME panel if it is being used in backup mode for some reason. Interrupt the existing broadcast operations and cause the NWR to send the code followed by the public warning alarm tone. At the conclusion of the warning alarm tone, immediately begin  READING THE MESSAGE EXACTLY AS WRITTEN .             a.  NUCLEAR ATTACK :             ""THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. REPEAT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ISSUED A TERMINATION OF THE ATTACK WARNING. FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED BY YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SINCE THERE MAY BE A DANGER OF RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT, YOU SHOULD NOT LEAVE A SHELTER OR PROTECTED LOCATION UNTIL YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCES THAT IT IS SAFE TO DO SO.""             b.  OTHER NON-WEATHER NATIONAL/REGIONAL HAZARD : Read the text of the message as provided by the appropriate authority.             The CANCELLATION MESSAGE shall be recorded and placed on the NWR routine broadcast cycle for at least 1 hour.             C.  Training Exercises .             NWS WFOs will be notified of training exercises in advance by the official government source. WFO management shall periodically review these instructions with all employees who might have to broadcast the warning.             USE OF NWR-SAME CODES AND 1050 HZ TONE ALARM                     Initial broadcasts of certain warnings and watches for the NWR service area shall be preceded by the NWR-SAME codes and the 1050 Hz warning alarm tones, as indicated below. Other watches, warnings, and certain related follow-up statements may be preceded by the codes and alarms, at regional option, as indicated below. Note that a future goal is to apply the NWR-SAME code to other broadcast messages, with this appendix updated accordingly.              Use of     NWR-SAME  NWR-SAME &     EVENT: Weather-Related   Code 1050 Hz               Tornado Watch TOA Yes     Tornado Warning TOR Yes     Severe Thunderstorm Watch SVA Yes     Severe Thunderstorm Warning SVR Yes     Severe Weather Statement SVS RH Option     Flash Flood Watch FFA RH Option     Flash Flood Warning FFW Yes     Flash Flood Statement FFS RH Option     Flood Watch FLA RH Option     Flood Warning FLW RH Option     Flood Statement FLS RH Option     Winter Storm Watch WSA No     Winter Storm Warning WSW RH Option     Blizzard Warning BZW RH Option     High Wind/Dust Storm Watch HWA No     High Wind/Dust Storm Warning HWW RH Option     Hurricane/Trop.

Many new NWR-SAME/EAS codes, particularly for non-weather-related events, are also being considered for authorization by the Federal Communications Commission, as mentioned above.     FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION     AUTHORIZATION FOR NWR REBROADCAST                     April 3, 1978             REBROADCAST OF NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE TRANSMISSIONS ALLOWED                     The commission has authorized AM, FM, and TV broadcast stations to rebroadcast weather transmissions originated by the National Weather Service on the 162.400, 162.475, and 162.550 MHz frequencies.             The action becomes effective immediately.             The Commission put four conditions on this authority:             -- Messages must be rebroadcast within one hour of receipt from the National Weather Service;             -- If commercials are aired in connection with a weather rebroadcast, they must not convey an endorsement by the Government of products or services advertised;             -- Credit must be given to indicate the messages originated with the National Weather Service; and             -- A station may not rebroadcast the transmissions of a Personal Radio Services station.             The FCC noted that when the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) and the EBS two-tone attention signal were used in conjunction with a weather emergency, operations must be conducted in accordance with section 73.935 of the rules (below) and the local or state EBS operational plans in effect for the area. It stressed emergency plans would take precedence over any monitoring and rebroadcasting conducted under the new authority.             Update notes:             (1) There are four additional frequencies for NOAA Weather Radio transmissions: 162.425 MHz, 162.450 MHz, and 162.525 MHz.             (2) The Emergency Alert System (EAS) replaced the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS).             (3) An updated Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 11.55 (shown on page G-2) replaces CFR section 73.935.             (4) An updated CFR section 73.1207 is on page G-3.                                  §  11.55 EAS operation during a State or Local Area emergency.                (a) The EAS may be activated at the State or Local Area levels by broadcast stations and cable systems at their discretion for day-to-day emergency situations posing a threat to life and property. Examples of natural emergencies which may warrant activation are: tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, heavy snows, icing conditions, widespread       fires, etc. Man-made emergencies may include: toxic gas leaks or liquid spills, widespread power failures, industrial explosions, and civil disorders.      (b) EAS operations must be conducted as specified in State and Local Area EAS Plans. The plans must list all authorized entities participating in the State or Local Area EAS.      (c) Immediately upon receipt of a State or Local Area EAS message, participating broadcast stations and cable systems must do the following:      (1) State Relay (SR) sources monitor the State Relay Network or follow the State EAS plan for instructions from the State Primary (SP) source.      (2) Local Primary (LP) sources monitor the Local Area SR sources or follow the State EAS plan for instructions.                (3) Participating National (PN) and Non-participating National (NN) sources monitor the Local Area LP sources for instructions.      (4) Broadcast stations and cable systems participating in the State or Local Area EAS must discontinue normal programming and follow the procedures in the State and Local Area Plans. Television stations must comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(7). Broadcast stations providing foreign language programming shall comply with Sec. 11.54(b)(8).      (5) Upon completion of the State or Local Area EAS transmission procedures, resume normal programming until receipt of the cue from the SR or LP sources in your Local Area. At that time begin transmitting the common emergency message received from the above sources.      (6) Resume normal operations upon conclusion of the message.      (7) The times of the above EAS actions must be entered in the       broadcast station or cable system records as specified in       Sec. 11.54(b)(15), FCC Form 201 may be used to report EAS activations.      (8) Use of the EAS codes or Attention Signal automatically grants rebroadcast authority as specified in Sec. 11.54(d).                                                   § 73.1207 Rebroadcasts.                (a) The term rebroadcast means reception by radio of the programs or other transmissions of a broadcast or any other type of radio station, and the simultaneous or subsequent retransmission of such programs or transmissions by a broadcast station.      (1) As used in this section, ``program'' includes any complete programs or part thereof.      (2) The transmission of a program from its point of origin to a broadcast station entirely by common carrier facilities, whether by wire line or radio, is not considered a rebroadcast.      (3) The broadcasting of a program relayed by a remote pickup       broadcast station is not considered a rebroadcast.      (b) No broadcast station may retransmit the program, or any part thereof, of another U.S. broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. A copy of the written consent of the licensee originating the program must be kept by the licensee of the station retransmitting such program and made available to the FCC upon request.      (1) Stations originating emergency communications under a State EAS plan are considered to have conferred rebroadcast authority to other participating stations.      (2) Permission must be obtained from the originating station to rebroadcast any subsidiary communications transmitted by means of a multiplex subcarrier or telecommunications service on the vertical blanking interval or in the visual signal of a television signal.      (3) Programs originated by the Voice of America (VOA) and the Armed Forces Radio and Television Services (AFRTS) cannot, in general, be cleared for domestic rebroadcast, and may therefore be retransmitted only by special arrangements among the parties concerned.      (4) Except as otherwise provided by international agreement,       programs originated by foreign broadcast stations may be retransmitted without the consent of the originating station.      (c) The transmissions of non-broadcast stations may be rebroadcast under the following conditions:      (1) Messages originated by privately-owned non-broadcast stations other than those in the Amateur and Citizens Band (CB) Radio Services may be broadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the non-broadcast licensee. Additionally, messages transmitted by common carrier stations may be rebroadcast only upon prior permission of the originator       of the message as well as the station licensee.      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, messages originated entirely by non-broadcast stations owned and operated by the Federal Government may be rebroadcast only upon receipt of prior permission from the government agency originating the messages.      (3) Messages originated by stations in the amateur and Citizens Band (CB) radio services may be rebroadcast at the discretion of broadcast station licensees.      (4) Emergency communications originated under a State EAS plan.      (d) The rebroadcasting of time signals originated by the Naval       Observatory and the National Bureau of Standards and messages from the National Weather Service stations is permitted without specific authorization under the following procedures:      (1) Naval Observatory Time Signals. (I) The time signals rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a naval radio station, or by land line circuits.                (ii) Announcement of the time signal must be made without reference to any commercial activity.      (iii) Identification of the Naval Observatory as the source of the time signal must be made by an announcement, substantially as follows: ``With the signal, the time will be . . . courtesy of the U.S. Naval Observatory.''      (iv) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained upon       request from the Superintendent, U.S. Naval Observatory, Washington, DC 20390.      (2) National Bureau of Standards Time Signals. (I) Time signals for rebroadcast must be obtained by direct radio reception from a National Bureau of Standards (NBS) station.      (ii) Use of receiving and rebroadcasting equipment must not delay the signals by more than 0.05 second.      (iii) Signals must be rebroadcast live, not from tape or other recording.      (iv) Voice or code announcements of the call signs of NBS stations are not to be rebroadcast.      (v) Identification of the origin of the service and the source of the signals must be made by an announcement substantially as follows:       ``At the tone, 11 hours 25 minutes Coordinated Universal Time. This is a rebroadcast of a continuous service furnished by the National Bureau of Standards, Ft. Collins, Colo.'' No commercial sponsorship of this announcement is permitted and none may be implied.      (vi) Schedules of time signal broadcasts may be obtained from, and notice of use of NBS time signals for rebroadcast must be forwarded semiannually to: National Bureau of Standards, Radio Stations WWV/WWVB, 2000 East County Road 58, Ft. Collins, Colorado 80524.      (vii) In the rebroadcasting of NBS time signals, announcements will not state that they are standard frequency transmissions. Voice announcements of Coordinated Universal Time are given in voice every minute. Each minute, except the first of the hour, begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1000 hertz at WWV and 1200 hertz tone at WWVH. The first minute of every hour begins with an 0.8 second long tone of 1500 hertz at both stations. This tone is followed by a 3-second pause, than the announcement, ``National Bureau of Standards Time.'' This is followed by another 3-second pause before station identification. This arrangement allows broadcast stations sufficient time to retransmit the hour time tone and the words ``National Bureau of Standards Time''either by manual or automatic switching.      (viii) Time signals or scales made up from integration of standard frequency signals broadcast from NBS stations may not be designated as national standard scales of time or attributed to the NBS as originator. For example, if a broadcasting station transmits time signals obtained from a studio clock which is periodically calibrated against the NBS time signals from WWV or WWVH, such signals may not be announced as NBS standard time or as having been originated by the NBS.      (3) National Weather Service Messages. (I) Messages of the National Weather Service must be rebroadcast within 1 hour of receipt.      (ii) If advertisements are given in connection with weather       rebroadcast, these advertisements must not directly or indirectly convey an endorsement by the U.S. Government of the products or services so advertised.      (iii) Credit must be given to indicate that the rebroadcast message originates with the National Weather Service.                  NWR REMOTE OFF-AIR MONITORING SYSTEM (ROAMS)                     Purpose : The purpose of this appendix is to describe the monitoring capabilities of the ROAMS and the actions WFO personnel should take in response to ROAMS messages to facilitate timely NWR transmitter network maintenance.             ROAMS Operation : ROAMS is designed to monitor and report on the failure status of several transmitter parameters/applications. Among the parameters/applications monitored by ROAMS are:     (1) primary transmitter AC power, (2) secondary transmitter AC power, (3) primary transmitter low broadcast power, (4) secondary transmitter low broadcast power , (5) program audio feed (signal at input to transmitter), (6) proper transmission of NWR-SAME messages from the transmitters, (7) transmitter radio frequency (RF) carrier output, and (8) lack of broadcast audio output. Additional parameters/applications (e.g., shelter temperature) may be added to this list at the discretion of the regions.             Response to ROAMS Calls : If ROAMS calls the site on an administrative telephone line, the operator should log the date and time of the call, the ROAMS ID, and the fault number(s) reported. A command to acknowledge the report should be sent following the report. Instructions on the remote operation of ROAMS are provided to each WFO that is programmed to receive these calls.             The ROAMS fault numbers and the required actions are listed in Table 1.             Response to ROAMS Fault Report on the NWR System : If ROAMS calls the NWR system, ROAMS will alert the operator through the Alert Message window. Each ROAMS telephone call will be reported with the transmitter ID in the Alert Message window without detailed alarm status. The operator should then use the ROAMS Data window under the Transmitters menu to check the detailed alarm status. Response to ROAMS status should be as listed in Table 1.                          Table 1                           ROAMS Fault ID*              Fault        Description              Follow-Up         Action              Whom to         Notify                 Input Power         Alarm       AC Power Failure to #1 Transmitter and System Power       If not equipped for automatic switch-over, switch to backup transmitter if available       Transmitter Site Power point of contact (POC)                 Alarm #1       Transmitter #1 output power is low        Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Technician                 Alarm #2       Transmitter #2 output power is low        Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Technician                 Alarm #3       AC Power Failure to #2 Transmitter       Same as for Input Power Alarm       Transmitter Site Power POC                 SAME        Alarm #8       Indicates bad SAME message       Retransmit SAME message to determine if bad messages persist       If bad messages persist, National ROAMS Control/ Monitoring point and local office technical staff as necessary                 Alarm #9       No broadcast audio       Response for last three alarms listed:               (a) Use ROAMS to check transmitter input audio                                                              If audio level acceptable, then (b); else (c)                 Alarm #10       No RF carrier from transmitter                                  (b) Use ROAMS to check broadcast audio       If audio level is acceptable, then problem has cleared; else Transmitter Technician                 Input Audio Alarm       Audio telephone feed has dropped below level to keep transmitter keyed       (c) Monitor console audio       If console level is acceptable, then Telecommunications        POC; else CRS technician                      * Note: Additional faults selected for monitoring should be coordinated at both regional and NWR Program Office levels.             Points of Contact : Table 1 shall be included in the station manual with telephone numbers for the five points of contact identified in the table.             Action Report : If maintenance action is required for any equipment as the result of a ROAMS report, an Engineering Management Reporting System report should be opened."

Purpose.  This chapter outlines National Weather Service (NWS) policy for obtaining special observations in support of various warning programs. It also provides the procedures an office should follow to request these observations.              2.  Aircraft Observations . Aircraft reconnaissance observations are provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Research Facilities Center (RFC) and the U.S. Air Force. Those offices that may request aircraft reconnaissance and the procedures they should use are given in the  National Hurricane Operations Plan and the National East Coast Winter Storms Operations Plan.              3.  Satellite Observations.  Special satellite observations are available through the Satellite Field Service Stations (SFSS) of the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS). The National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) receives special support from SFSS Kansas City. The National Hurricane Center (NHC), Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC), and Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) are supported by SFSS's Miami, San Francisco, and Honolulu, respectively.              The SFSS's provide special sectors to cover the storm areas of concern to these centers. WSFO's (Weather Service Forecast Office) may receive the special sectors by telephone request to the supporting SFSS.              4.  Surface Observations.  Special surface observations are available from all U.S. synoptic and aviation network stations, ships, Marine Reporting Stations (MARS), Great Lakes Coast Guard Stations, and coastal tide stations. All offices are encouraged to arrange for cooperative observations from areas in which regular coverage is sparse.              4.1  Hurricane Office Support . Surface observations in support of the hurricane warning service may be requested by any hurricane center, hurricane warning office, or weather service office while performing a hurricane warning function. This includes both tropical and subtropical storms.              4.1.1  Land Observations.  The forecaster will specify, depending on the capability of the office, whether aviation or synoptic observations are required. The Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 1 (FMH-l), Surface Observations; FMH-2, Synoptic Observations; and Weather Service Operations Manual (WSOM) Chapter E-41 give the observing procedures to be followed. In the synoptic observations the forecaster must specifically request tide height, sea, swell, or wind fluctuations.                  a.  MARS . Forecasters will make their requests for additional and special MARS observations through the appropriate Coast Guard (CG) District Headquarters as follows.                                                 First Coast Guard District                                    Maine to Rhode Island                                            Third Coast Guard District                                    Connecticut to Delaware                                            Fifth Coast Guard District                                    Maryland to North Carolina                                            Seventh Coast Guard District                                    South Carolina to Florida (east of 85 o W)                                            Eighth Coast Guard District                                    Florida (west of 85 o W) to Mexico                                            Eleventh Coast Guard District                                    Santa Maria River to Mexico                                            Twelfth Coast Guard District                                    Oregon Border to Santa Maria River                                            Thirteenth Coast Guard District                                   Washington to California                                The locations of stations in this program are given in WSOM Chapter B-16.              b.  Transmission of Observations . One of the following methods of transmission will be used where available, otherwise the observation will be telephoned to the requesting office.                  a. National Distribution Circuit (NDC)/State Distribution Circuit (SDC) (these are the main circuits used with the Automation of Field Operation & Services (AFOS) System)         b. RAWARC         c. 7072         d. Service A or C as appropriate, in first open period         e. West Coast Marine Circuit         f. NOAA Weather Wire         g. Any other telecommunications system that would be available at the requesting office.              4.1.2  Ship Observations . During the hurricane season the NWS makes requests for special ship observations from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, North Atlantic waters west of 35EW, and North Pacific waters east of 180E W. Observations can be requested at 1-, 2-, or 3-hourly intervals as required.              a.  Atlantic and Pacific Merchant Vessel Reporting Program.  The CG (Coast Guard) Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC) New York, New York, and San Francisco, California, operate the Automated Merchant Vessel Reporting Program (AMVER). When no or only a few observations are received from a storm area, the Hurricane Center responsible for issuing marine advisories may ask their local CG station to send a message addressed to ""AMVER, NEW YORK, NY,"" or ""AMVER, SAN FRANCISCO, CA,"" as appropriate, requesting a list of ships, with their radio call signs, that are underway in the storm area.

To speed delivery of messages from storm areas and to identify them as such, the word ""STORM"" should appear immediately following the radio address.                  b.  Method of Requesting Observations.  Requests to ships are broadcast by radio shore stations operated by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), TRT Telecommunications Corp., American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T), ITT World Communications, Inc., Mobile Radio (WLO), and the U.S. Coast Guard. In Puerto Rico, requests are made through facilities operated by the CG at San Juan, the Cable and Wireless Ltd. at Barbados, the French Government of Martinique, and the Netherlands Antilles Government of Curacao.              Requests for special ship weather reports should be sent to the NWS office located near the radio shore station, for relay to the radio shore station, or should be sent directly to the radio shore station(s) if there is no nearby NWS office. The NWS offices and/or radio shore stations to be contacted can be determined from exhibit B-90-1.                  c.  Requests Transmitted by Radio Station NMR, San Juan PR . NHC requests for special ship observations transmitted by Radio Station NMR will be sent to Airway Observer, San Juan, Puerto Rico, via Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radio teletypewriter (RTT) circuit.                  d.

Requests Via Marine Broadcasts.  Whenever radio shore stations have been asked to make direct calls to ships for special reports, the hurricane warning office (HWO) or center initiating the action will also arrange for including similar requests in the warning section of the marine broadcasts. The office concerned should forward its requests via the NDC/ SDC, teletypewriter, telegraph, telephone, or radio in order to reach the WSFO preparing material for the marine broadcasts at least 2 hours prior to the starting time of the broadcasts. The office originating the request, the radio station(s) making the broadcast, and the broadcast schedule for the marine broadcasts are shown in exhibit B-90-2.              In addition, WSFO San Francisco will arrange with the USCG Communications Station San Francisco and WSFO Honolulu will coordinate with the U.S. CG Communications Station, Honolulu, for inclusion of requests for special ship observations in the NMC Point Reyes and NMO Honolulu, General Weather Broadcasts as indicated in exhibit B-90-2.                  f.  Example of Request in Marine Broadcast.  If requests are worded in accordance with the example below, they will require little, if any, editing by marine forecast units.

Duration of Request . Each request for special ship observations will be confined to a period not to exceed the ensuing 24 hours. The hurricane warning office (HWO) or hurricane center concerned will renew its request every 24 hours thereafter, or more often, when the geographical area in the preceding request requires modification. On occasions when responsibility for issuing advisories is transferred from one office to another, the latter office will continue to renew the requests for special ship observations under the same conditions as indicated above, as long as the storm is in progress overwater or until it moves inland over the United States, Mexico, or Canada.                                                       North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Waters                                                                                                                                              Starting                         Message to be                                            Office                                   To be included in                                   Schedules of                                   addressed via                                            Originating Request                                    broadcasts from                                   Broadcasts                                   TT or RTT To:                                            #NHC, Miami, FL                  NSS Annapolis, MD.                                                                              #WSFO, New Orleans,LA/HWO                                    NAR Key West, FL.                                    0030, 0630Z                                KWBC                                            #WSFO, San Juan, PR/HWO                                    NAM Norfolk, VA.                                   1230, 1900Z                                Washington,DC                                            #WSFO, Boston, MA/HWO                                    NSS Londonderry, N.Ire.                                                                                         #WSFO, Washington, DC|HWO                                    NRK Reykjavik, Iceland                                                                                                                            GXH Thurso, Scotland                                                                                                                            AOK Rota, Spain                                                                                        North Pacific Waters, West of Central America and Mexico                                            WSFO, San Francisco,                                    KFS, San Francisco,                                             0420, 1620                                            CA/EPHC                                   CA (Marine)                                            2300Z                                                                               KOK, Los Angeles,                                             0450, 1650Z KSFO                                            WSFO, Honolulu,                                   CA (Marine)                                            San Francisco,                                            HI/CPHC                                   NMQ, Long Beach                                   0420, 1720Z                                CA                                                                               CA (Marine)                                                                                                                           NMC, San Francisco,                                             0030, 0630                                                                               CA (Marine)                                            1900, 2100Z                                            North Pacific Waters, Adjacent to Hawaiian Islands                           WSFO, Honolulu, HI/CPHC                                                                                                                                                              NMO, Honolulu, HI 0500, 2000Z                                            #All broadcasts keyed simultaneously from Northern Ireland                                Exhibit B-90-2:  Schedule of Radiotelegraph High Seas Marine Broadcasts Containing Requests for Special Ship Weather Observations                      Offices preparing marine broadcasts will include the same request for observations in each succeeding broadcast during the ensuing 24 hours, unless superseded by a new request.              4.1.3  Requests by Navy Fleet Weather Central in the Pacific . Occasionally, U.S. Navy Fleet Weather Centrals in the Pacific area may originate requests for special reports from ships in the vicinity of the storm. There is no objection to this arrangement provided the special reports are requested only from Military Sea Lift Command (MSC) and other government vessels that employ government communications for relaying their messages. If the request involves message tolls to be paid by the NWS, such requests should be coordinated with the CPHC or EPHC before broadcast.              4.1.4  Special Radio Reports on Overtime . The NWS has arranged with a number of the U.S. registry vessels, which have a single radio operator, to transmit to ""OBS METEO WASHDC"" 1200Z weather reports from eastern Pacific waters. The radio operator is paid overtime by the NWS for transmitting these reports. A current list of the ships authorized overtime, together with their radio call signs, is supplied to NHC, EPHC, CPHC, and the HWO's.              4.1.5  Request for Hourly Reports . In the event any of the ships listed for overtime reports are in a storm area and special reports are needed at hourly intervals during the day or night, the HWO responsible for issuance of the advisories should dispatch individual messages to each vessel. These messages will be sent via government or commercial radio stating the times at which special radio reports are required.              4.1.6  Time for Filing Messages . Individual messages requesting special nighttime or early morning reports should be filed early to allow their receipt before the radio officer completes his watch (8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time).              4.1.7  Message to Individual Vessels . Individual messages maybe sent to vessels other than overtime contract ships in the storm area, whether U.S. or foreign registry, at the discretion of the forecaster. Messages addressed to individual U.S. ships, other than overtime contract ships, may have the following statement added to their request: RADIO OPERATOR OVERTIME PAY AUTHORIZED IF NECESSARY.              4.1.8  Verification of Suspected Data . Whenever the HWO responsible for issuing formal advisories notes that ""LaLaLa,"" ""LoLoLo,"" ""PPP,"" or other important data appear to be in error, the office entering the reports on Service C, circuit 7072 or the SDC/NDC should be asked to send a service message to the radio shore station requesting the ship to verify the questioned data. However, the office should first ascertain that such errors are not merely transposition of code figures in the message; e.g., LaLaLacoded as 271 instead 217.              4.1.9  Distribution of Ship Observations.  When radio shore stations receive special ship observations, they utilize a number of methods in relaying these reports to the NWS. These methods include Timed Wire Service (TWX), AFOS external users circuits, telephone, RAWARC, and direct teletypewriter links to NWS offices. The NWS office which originally receives the observation is responsible for relaying it to all possible users according to the following:                  a.  Camp Springs, Communications Branch . All messages addressed ""OBS METEO,"" or observations preceded by the word ""STORM"" from the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and North Atlantic waters will be promptly placed on circuit 7072 and the NDC/SDC. In addition, they will feed into the computer along with other ship reports for later readouts in summary form on Service C, Service O, and the NDC. Messages of interest to San Francisco and Honolulu will also be relayed via circuits GD60138 and GF10211, respectively, until these stations are placed on the NDC. All 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800Z ""OBSMETEO WASHDC"" ship weather messages will be entered by the Suitland Communications Branch via the WMSC, 7072, and the NDC.                  b.  Pacific Offices.  Observations needed by EPHC San Francisco are addressed to ""OBS METEO WASHDC"" and relayed to Suitland through San Francisco. These observations are returned to San Francisco via circuit GD60138 and Services C and O until San Francisco becomes a node on the NDC. Observations needed by CPHC Honolulu are addressed to ""OBS METEO HONOLULU"" and sent directly to Suitland via the NWS cable and land lines. Suitland returns them to Honolulu via circuit GF10211 and to San Francisco via circuit 23401 and Services C and O until these stations are included on the NDC.              4.1.10  Weather Observations from Environmental Data Buoys . System maintenance, calibration, and final data quality verification are under the technical control of the NOAA Data Buoy Office and its supporting contractors. Requests for system status and schedule information should be directed to the NOAA Data Buoy Office in Mississippi.              NHC, HWO, and Storm Coordination Center (SCC) requests for special or more frequent interrogations during critical storm periods will be accommodated by phone requests to the Miami Radio Station Duty Officer, telephone (305) 233-2743 or FTS 350-4750. The start and stop time for special hourly reports should be given and limited to 12 consecutive hours of operation unless an emergency exists. In this case, consultation should be made with the NOAA Data Buoy Office.              4.1.11  Radar Observations.  Special radar observations may be requested in accordance with FMH-7, Weather Radar Observations and Chapter B-50.              4.2  Support to Other Offices . Any NWS office may request extra observations from any office in the surface observational network in order to carry out its warning responsibilities. All offices are also encouraged to establish cooperative observation networks in data sparse regions of their warning area for use in potential or actual warning situations.              NWS offices which normally close during the night may be requested by the WSFO to remain open to make and transmit additional surface observations. Overtime, paid or compensatory, in accordance with the provisions of  NOAA Personnel Handbook and subsequent directives updating these provisions, is authorized when necessary to fulfill a station's warning responsibility. Requests from offices outside a given forecast area for extra hours of operation at stations within the forecast area should be coordinated through the responsible WSFO and not with the individual station.              4.2.1  Coastal Flood Warning Service Observations.  Coastal offices have arranged for cooperative tide observations from stations of the Tide Height Reporting Network during potential or actual warning situations. NWS offices should initiate calls to cooperative tide stations for observations whenever needed. Supplemental observations should be input to the NDC/SDC, RAWARC, or phoned to the appropriate WSFO.              The NWS offices equipped with tide recorders from National Ocean Survey (NOS) tide gages and the tide gage from which they receive their information are indicated in the Operations of the National Weather Service and exhibit B-90-3.              4.2.2  Flash Flood Warning Observations . NWS offices should request special observations from their river and rainfall observers whenever the potential for flash flood producing precipitation exists. Reporting instructions are contained in WSOM E-41. Some observers have instructions to report as soon as certain criteria are met. Instructions for special radar observations can be found in WSOM Chapter E-13, Flash Flood Program.              4.2.3  Ship Observations.  Any WSFO with coastal waters or high seas forecast responsibility may obtain special ship reports by following the procedures given in subsections 4.1.2 to 4.1.9.

Upper-air stations may make special observations into the eye of a hurricane on their own initiative.              5.1.1  Special Observations from Weather Service Land Stations . All requests for special rawinsonde or winds-aloft observations during tropical storm situations should be routed through the appropriate hurricane center, including requests from the National Meteorological Center (NMC), NSSFC, and the National Hurricane and Experimental Meteorology Lab (NHEML). The hurricane center will relay the final instructions to rawinsonde stations so maximum use is being made of the special reports. The hurricane center should always specify whether complete runs or only winds-aloft observations are required and the height to be reached. Special runs should be requested for the usual intermediate synoptic times of 06 to 18 GMT insofar as possible. Also, requests should be placed 6 hours in advance of taking the observation. The hurricane center will advise its regional headquarters Data Acquisition Division (DATAC) personnel of actions taken. For pibals, only a copy of the request needs to be sent to the station involved and its regional headquarters.              Pacific area officials in charge are authorized to make special rawinsonde observations, up to a frequency of one observation each 6 hours, whenever the center of a tropical storm or typhoon is suspected to be within 300 nautical miles of their station; whenever local conditions indicate that a tropical storm is developing in the vicinity of the station; or as requested by a center.              5.1.2  Special Upper-Air Observations from a Foreign Meteorological Service . When feasible, requests for special observations from cooperative upper-air stations operated by foreign meteorological services will be placed by NHC through the director of the foreign meteorological service concerned or his authorized representative. When time does not permit prior coordination, requests may be made directly to the foreign upper-air station when such action has been authorized.              5.1.3  Special Observations from Ocean Station Vessel HOTEL (C7H).  Requests for special upper-air observations from Ocean Station Vessel HOTEL in the Eastern Region Ocean Weather (ROW) project, either on station or enroute, will be made through the marine forecaster, WSFO Washington. The request should include the desired frequency of additional observations and for how long a period they are required.              5.1.4  Calling Out Ocean Station Vessel C7H.  During June and July when C7H has yard period, the ship can be called out and be on station in 48 hours. When the NHC determines that C7H is necessary for the forecasting of a tropical cyclone, the Director or his Deputy will so notify the Warnings Program Leader (W112x3). The Warnings Program Leader will call the U.S. Coast Guard and request that C7H return to station,              5.2  Severe Local Storms Support . NSSFC and any WSFO are authorized to request special upper-air observations from any NWS upper-air station within its area of responsibility, but requests must be coordinated through NSSFC. Each office's regional headquarters DATAC Division must be advised of all requests. NSSFC will consolidate requests with their own requirements and advise field stations via RAWARC, phone, or an administrative message on the NDC/SDC. The special upper-air observation should be sent back to NSSFC or the requesting WSFO via RAWARC, telephone, or as an addressed special observation on the NDC/SDC. The authority to request a special observation rests with the meteorologist in charge of the requesting office or, in his absence, the senior forecaster on duty. The request may be complete rawinsonde, a rawin, or a pibal observation. NSSFC requires runs to be evaluated up to 400 mbs.              5.2.1  NSSFC.  Whenever there is a possibility of severe weather developing anywhere in the contiguous United States, NSSFC is authorized to request special upper-air observations from any NWS upper-air station.              5.2.2  Weather Service Forecast Offices.  These offices are authorized to request special upper-air observations for a severe weather situation whenever NSSFC has not requested them and such requests would assist in the preparation of their forecasts, but such requests must be coordinated through NSSFC.              5.2.3  Upper-Air Station . Upon receipt of such a request, the upper air station involved should make every effort to accomplish the special observation. Necessary overtime is authorized. Do not report these specials on WS Form A-22.              5.2.4  Limit on Specials.  Each region is limited to a total of no more than 200 special rawins and/or rawinsondes per year. However, should additional flights be desired Weather Service Headquarters' authorization may be requested. No limit is set on special pibal observations.              5.2.5  Requests by Air Weather Service.  Special rawinsondes requested by the Air Weather Service are authorized on a reimbursable basis but specific regional headquarters' (DATAC) approval is required. NSSFC should receive a copy of any special rawinsonde request made by the Air Weather Service.              5.3  Support to Other NWS Offices . WSFO's are authorized to request special upper-air observations directly from upper-air stations whenever such observations will assist in making timely forecasts for any of the WSFO's programs. The authorization is normally limited to nearby upper-air stations. The requests should be made in sufficient time to allow any necessary rescheduling of shifts except in an emergency. Stations should be given a minimum of 6 hours' notice, Also, as soon as possible, regional headquarters DATAC should be advised of requests made.              6.  Tsunami Warning System Observations.  Tsunami warning centers have arranged for seismic and tide observations from selected NWS offices and cooperating stations participating in the Tsunami Warning System. Warning centers will initiate calls to cooperative stations for data whenever needed (exhibit B-90-4 indicates Weather Service Offices WSO's supplying tide data to the tsunami warning center).              NWS offices which normally close at night may be requested to remain open to make and transmit observations. Overtime provisions are as stated in subsection 4.2.

NOAA Weather Radio stations broadcast the latest             weather information and are one of the primary means for receiving severe weather             information and general forecast information. Weather radios can be purchased from local             electric supply dealers, and some scanners are equipped to pick up the weather radio             frequencies.                             Some models have an alarm feature. This feature sounds a tone and turns on the radio when             we activate the tone alert from our office. We activate the tone alert for the following             watches or warnings:                                  Tornado watch                   Tornado warning                   Severe thunderstorm watch                   Severe thunderstorm warning                   Flash flood warning                               If the following weather situations evolve quickly, the             following warnings or statements may also be ""toned"".

GX051-48-16471792	"AUTOMATED BROADCASTS ON NOAA WEATHER RADIO:  A CENTRAL ILLINOIS LISTENER SURVEY         Christopher W. Geelhart, Kirk M. Huettl, and Christopher J. Miller  National Weather Service Office  Central, Illinois (Lincoln)         INTRODUCTION    The National Weather Service (NWS) has deployed the Console Replacement System (CRS), to operate the NOAA Weather Radio (NWR) system. The CRS is equipped with synthesized voice capability, for immediate broadcast of forecasts, warnings, and observations.    Each Weather Forecast Office (WFO) is required to periodically conduct listener surveys, as part of the quality control process of NWR. It is recommended that this be done at least every two years.    The last listener survey conducted by WFO Central Illinois (ILX) was in the Fall of 1996. The next survey, which normally would have been conducted in 1998, was postponed until the CRS was fully deployed at ILX. This would allow listeners to provide input about the new synthesized voice system.    USE OF THE CRS IN CENTRAL ILLINOIS    The CRS was deployed at WFO ILX in May 1998. The system was configured for local use during the Summer of 1998, with most routine broadcasts utilizing the old AMPRO tape system. Routine use of CRS (in manual mode) began in August 1998.    In November 1998, the hourly weather roundup was the first product to be automated. Other products were gradually added through the winter and spring. Routine automation was completed in June 1999, with the zone forecast product being automatically generated. Severe weather products, as well as winter and non-precipitation advisories and warnings, were manually recorded during this time.    METHODS OF REACHING NWR LISTENERS    An announcement was broadcast on each of the ILX NWR stations (WXJ-71 in Peoria, WXJ-75 in Springfield, WXJ-76 in Champaign) for approximately two weeks. Listeners were asked to either send a letter or postcard, or call the office to request a survey. An online version was also posted on the ILX Internet homepage. A copy of the survey can be found in Appendix A.    We had a significant increase in participation in this year's survey. The 1996 survey had 188 participants, including 12 through the Internet version. In 1999, 428 surveys were completed, 237 of which were done on the ILX Internet. Nearly every mailed survey was returned. The increase in participation could possibly be traced to any number of factors, including the initiation of automated broadcasts, the opportunity to call the office and request a survey (instead of mailing the request), and the explosion of Internet usage over recent years.    QUESTION FORMAT    The 1999 ILX survey featured ten questions. The first few are standard questions, including strength of signal, perception of our severe weather coverage, whether their receiver has an alarm feature, and if the alarm is used. Figure 1 shows a map of each NWR listening area, and how listeners perceived the quality of the signal.       Figure 1. WFO Lincoln, Illinois (ILX) Weather Radio Coverage Area.    Six questions addressed the CRS and automated broadcasts. A short introduction was given, to explain the reasoning for switching to automated broadcasts. These were:        Preference of voice type. ILX uses the three voices approved by Weather   Service Headquarters. Names for each voice were the ones given by DEC-Talk,   creators of the synthesized voice. These are: Harry (""deep male""   voice), Paul (""standard male""), and Frank (""older male"").   The question also referenced which products use which voices.        Clarity of the voices. Listeners were asked if the voices are usually   understandable, somewhat understandable, or usually not understandable.        Listeners were asked to list any words they thought the voices had   a hard time pronouncing.        Timeliness of broadcasts. Since faster updates were promoted as one   of the reasons for CRS implementation, listeners were asked to rank the   timeliness as improved, same, or worse.        Automated ""critical"" products. There has been concern in   many areas, about using the synthesized voice for severe weather products.   Listeners were asked how they would react if ILX were to implement automated   severe weather products. They could say they would react the same as now,   switch to commercial radio/TV or the Internet, or they would be less likely   to react.        Listeners were given space for additional comments.     RESULTS        Listener locations (Figure 2): Forty-four percent listed to   WXJ-71 (Peoria); 32 percent listened to WXJ-75 (Springfield); and 24 percent   listened to WXJ-76 (Champaign).          Figure 2. Locations of the listeners of NOAA Weather Radio for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) grouped by transmitter.        When asked about an alarm feature, 56 percent of the listeners said   their receivers have an alarm feature. Of those, 77 percent of them use   the alarm feature. When asked why they didn't, most said they get information   off commercial radio/TV, or the Internet.        For severe weather coverage, 49 percent ranked our coverage   as excellent; 43 percent as good; 5 percent as fair; and 3 percent as poor   (Figure 3).          Figure 3. Rankings of NOAA Weather Radio Severe Weather coverage for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX).        The majority of listeners do not have a ""favorite"" voice   type. As shown in Figure 4, 45 percent said they had no preference; 24   percent couldn't tell the difference between them; 12 percent prefer Paul   (""standard male""); 12 percent prefer Harry (""deep male"");   and 7 percent prefer Frank (""older male"").          Figure 4. Rankings of Console Replacement System (CRS) synthesized voice preference for WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX).        Most listeners felt the voices are understandable (Figure 5.) Eighty-two   percent ranked them as ""usually understandable"", followed by   15 percent as ""sometimes understandable"", and 3 percent as ""usually   not understandable"".            Figure 5. Survey responses of the understandability/clarity of the automated voices used on the WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) CRS.        About a third of the listeners gave examples of words that are hard   to distinguish. These included town names, ""yesterday"", and numbers   (especially teens and in the 40 to 60 range). Many also commented about   how some words are not distinguishable at times, including those with ""s"",   ""th"", ""n"", and ""f"" sounds.    Most people were satisfied with the timeliness of updates. As indicated   in Figure 6, 54 percent said ILX has improved in this category; 42 percent   perceived no change; and 5 percent felt timeliness has worsened.        Figure 6. Survey results of the timeliness of updated products on the WFO Lincoln, IL (KILX) CRS.        Figure 7 shows how respondents expressed their feelings about automated   warnings. Fifty-eight percent said it would not change their reactions   to the warnings. Twenty-three percent said they would switch to commercial   radio/TV, or the Internet. Eighteen percent felt they would be less likely   to react to the warning.        Figure 7. Survey results of how WFO Lincoln (KILX) NOAA Weather Radio Listeners would react to automated severe weather warnings.        Many people took the opportunity to make additional comments. These   can be found in Appendix B.     SUMMARY    The listeners of the central Illinois NWR stations seem to have accepted the automation of NWR. Many have noticed an increase in timeliness of the broadcasts, which is one of the benefits of the CRS. They expressed concern about automating severe weather products, but a majority would continue to use NWR if this were the case. They also made several suggestions for improvement, which will be incorporated in NWR programming.

Please take the time to answer the following questions and return the completed survey to us by October 17, 1999. (A pre-addressed, stamped envelope is provided for your convenience.)    1.  Where are you located? From what city, town, or portion of a county do you listen to us?         2.  Please rank the strength of the signal from your location:         Strong    Good    Weak    Variable        3.  Please answer the following questions regarding your weather radio receiver.          Yes/No    Does it have an alarm feature?       Yes/No    Do you use the alarm feature?            If you answered ""No"" to part B, why not?      _____ It goes off too much.    _____ I don't know how to program it (only applies to the latest generation of radio receivers).    _____ I get my severe weather information off commercial radio/TV or the Internet.    _____ Other (please explain):    4.  How would you rank our severe weather coverage?              Excellent      Good      Fair      Poor (please explain)               Over the past year, we introduced computerized voicing for routine weather radio broadcasts. This was done to allow for more frequent and timely updates, to ease the burden of programming the multiple NWR stations we operate, to allow NWS personnel to focus on other critical tasks, and to replace 1970's-era tape equipment.    The next few questions will deal with the ""new"" NWR.    5.  We use three different voice types. ""Harry"" reads the station identification, regional synopsis, and traveler's forecast. ""Frank"" reads the climatic summary. ""Paul"" reads the hourly weather report and the forecast. Which of these is easiest to listen to?    ______ Harry    ______ Frank    ______ Paul    ______ No preference    ______ I can't tell the difference.    6.  Overall, how easily understood are the voices?    ______ Usually understandable    ______ Sometimes understandable    ______ Usually cannot understand the voices    7.  Are there any words that you think it has a hard time pronouncing?    8.  Do you feel the timeliness of updates has improved, stayed the same, or gotten worse?    ______ Improved    ______ Same    ______ Worse    9.  How would you react if the computerized voices were to be used during severe weather?        I would react the same as I do now.    I would switch to radio/TV/Internet for information.    I would be less likely to react to the warning.     10.

APPENDIX B         LISTENER COMMENTS        I guess if you had to use the artificial voice, then you had to. I   don't like it, and think it is stupid to use different tones of the same   voice. Until I read this survey, I had no idea that you thought they were   different in any way. They are not, and do not sound human. Even if they   were to sound human, they make simple mistakes, such as saying ""conditions   range from clear to clear,"" which isn't something a human would say.   If it saves you taxpayer dollars and allows you to focus on more important   issues, then go ahead.            I do not really like the computer voices. It is like automated telephone   stuff.`Course I`m an old guy and some alleged progress isn't, in my opinion.            I listen every morning between the hours of 6-8. Would be nice if all   you had in early a.m. was temp. and daily forecast. Sometimes it takes   forever to get through the traveler's forecast, hurricane update, and weather   synopsis just to get the temperature. Your early warning of severe weather   is ALWAYS several minutes ahead of local TV and radio which I appreciate.            I think that the NOAA weather radio is the best form of receiving alerts   for severe weather. I live in a rural area where it is difficult to hear   warning sirens, especially if the windows are closed, and I can't keep   my local TV station turned on 24 hours like I can with the NOAA weather   radio. I have really come to depend on the weather alerts that you broadcast.            Forecasts are fine. But during severe weather, timeliness is everything!!   Whose voice and whether computerized or live is not important. Keep up   the good work!            I have listened to WXJ-75 since the early 1980's. It is a VERY valuable   service to our region. Our thanks to all of you who make this service possible.            The fake voices are so monotonous that my wife and I quit listening   and had to run the forecast three or four times before we know what it   says. The voices are terribly boring, and have lowered my opinion of NOAA.            I would still like to hear live transmissions during severe weather   as one can never be sure if the computer system is functioning correctly   and therefore I may not be sure if severe weather reports are current enough.   Live broadcasts during severe weather would make me feel more secure, knowing   that a ""person"" is keeping up with the situation.            It seems as if statements aren't issued often during a warning. Many   times a warning is issued for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and no updates are   issued before it expires. It would be good if we could know what the storm   is doing while we are taking cover. This may help keep people inside during   the storm. Sometimes the expiration message is broadcast several minutes   after the warning has expired, and local media seem confused about what   is happening.            I must admit, I was disappointed when you began deploying the computerized   voicing on your broadcasts. But I've grown accustomed to hearing the computer   voices during the past year. Unfortunately, we hear and talk to computers   more and more all the time; the personal element of communication is gradually   disappearing.            Thank you for doing this survey. It shows that public input is considered   instead of just government big bucks dictating what is done.            Your service is much appreciated. It has become part of my morning   rituals, #1. Start the coffee! #2. Take the weather radio from the kitchen   drawer. #3. Drink coffee and listen.            I really enjoy your weather program. It informs me of everything I   need to know about what the current weather is, what the next few days   will be like, and it does a great job updating me on severe weather. Thanks.            This past spring I didn't really feel like I could depend on NOAA to   give me accurate weather updates. I live in a rural area and I really depend   on my weather radio to protect my kids and myself, because there are no   sirens out here! The coverage you provided in April of 1996 on that unforgettable   night was top notch! You guys were right on top of everything that was   happening that night! That's the kind of severe weather coverage I would   like to see come back to NOAA.            I have listened to my Radio Shack brown box weather radio for almost   25 years and it's an almost daily occurrence. I miss it when I am not at   home. I have listened to it also when there are severe weather conditions   in addition to radio or TV.            I think severe weather information should continue to be live -- the   NWS has done such a good job over the years of connecting with the public,   and employing the computerized voice would be a step backward in this regard.            The quality of the voices is getting better, or I'm getting used to   them; they still don't sound very good. Human voices are much more pleasant   to listen to, but I recognize the cost to keep humans there 24 hours a   day is very high.            LOSE the automated voice! This is the worst feature ever implemented   by NOAA!! The voice sounds about as clear as the programs that came with   sound cards on computers ten years ago!!! If NOAA can't find a better,   more clear voice program to use go back to the human system.            Overall, my listening experience has been degraded by the introduction   of ""NOAA Weather Radio 2000"". Even though the service is probably   designed to provide information in the strictest possible sense, I feel   that an intangible quality is lost in the forecasts by having a machine   read them.... The forecasts are much less user-friendly since the introduction   of this new system.            This ""generation"" of computerized voice is excellent - much   improved over the original - as you well know. Thanks for a very fine service.            When you really blow a forecast, acknowledge it and explain why. Your   credibility suffers when you predict dangerous conditions and half an hour   later have an entirely different forecast. Leaves the listeners wondering   if you know what you are talking about.            It seems ""Paul"" has improved since you first began using   computerized voicing, but I prefer Harry or Frank. I wear two hearing aids,   and that is a factor for me in deciding which I can more easily understand.            There seems to be a lot of background noise and voices, as though too   many ""mikes"" were audible to listeners, or someone ""back   there"" has a radio on!            Timeliness has always been excellent - the immediacy of the broadcasts   during severe weather is outstanding! Would like to see all local radio   and TV stations use your severe weather broadcasts as transmitted immediately   upon receipt!"
