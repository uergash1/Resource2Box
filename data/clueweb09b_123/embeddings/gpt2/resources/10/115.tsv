At the time the school operated as a junior college, offering freshman-level courses to 250 students during the first school year, and was under control of the  New Hanover County  Board of Education. Wilmington College earned accreditation from the North Carolina College Conference in 1948 and became a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges. Further accreditation came in 1952 when the institution was so honored by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.   In 1958 Wilmington College was placed under the Community College Act of North Carolina, thereby passing control from the New Hanover County Board of Education to a board of trustees. The college was now state-supported and under the supervision of the North Carolina Board of Higher Education.   Wilmington College became a senior college on  July 1 ,  1963 , when the  North Carolina General Assembly  passed legislation allowing the school to offer a four-year curriculum and award bachelor's degrees. Six years later,  July 1 ,  1969 , the name of the school was changed to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, making UNCW the fifth campus of the  University of North Carolina  system. On  August 22 ,  1977 , UNCW was authorized to offer its first graduate programs at the master's level. [3]  Currently, UNCW has over 11,000 students enrolled and nearly 500 full-time faculty members. The school offers seventy-three bachelor's degrees, thirty master's degrees, and two doctoral degrees. [4]     [ edit ]   Student Life     [ edit ]   Campus Life   The wide variety of programs in  liberal arts ,  biological sciences ,  fine arts , and the universitys esteemed film studies program draws a variety of undergraduate and graduate students from across the United States. The close proximity to  Wrightsville Beach  is witnessed as a primary draw for incoming freshman, though the allure dies down noticeably for upper classmen.   Teal  is the official school color of UNCW, with  white  and  gold  as alternate colors. The school color has become a point of pride for students, which is widely illustrated with spirit shirts bearing slogans such as Feel my Teal and exclusive teal-colored  Rainbow Sandals  being offered through the university bookstore.   In recent years, UNCW has progressed beyond its aging reputation as a party school, and improved academics at the university have given it the appeal as a rising star in the public university system of North Carolina. By 2008, the average  SAT  score for incoming freshman was 1156, with an average GPA of 3.74. [ 1 ]   UNCW has struggled to diversify its student body, with only 11% of enrolled students referred to as Minority. As such, the university has implemented a commitment to diversity as one of its strategic goals, and many on-campus events have been held in this pursuit. However, this issue is somewhat offset by UNCWs impressive enrollment of female students, which make up nearly 60% of the student body.   There is a leading superstition on campus that stepping on the school seal located outside Randall Library will prevent a student from graduating on time.     [ edit ]   Greek Life   Greek life at UNCW is prominent, but in no way dominant of social life on-campus. In 2007, to address the lack of official fraternity and sorority housing (allegedly due to an old Wilmington anti-brothel law) sororities and fraternities were moved into the University Suites and University Apartments respectively.   Phi Sigma Pi  functions as the universitys co-educational honors fraternity, but does not participate in UNCWs Pan-Hellenic council.     [ edit ]   Student Facilities   In 2000, the Student Recreation Center was opened to students, staff, and faculty members. It houses three basketball courts, a host of exercise machines, a weight training area, an indoor running track, and an indoor  climbing wall . It also includes a group exercise room which supports multiple clubs and activities, including  Yoga ,  Pilates , and an  Aikido  club.   Lumina Theater, named after the boardwalk theater that was once found on  Wrightsville Beach , offers a professional movie theater experience to the UNCW community. Opened in August of 2006, the Lumina Theater features 360 stadium seats, a 15.5' x 30' screen, Dolby Digital surround sound, 35mm capabilities and a digital projection system. Lumina screens blockbusters, independents, cult classics, art films, international films and student films throughout the academic year, four or more days a week, except during University holidays and breaks. Some notable Lumina events included a multi-part,  high-definition  screening of BBC's  Planet Earth  series over the span of several weekends, and a yearly 24-hour lock-in.     [ edit ]   Residential Accommodation   Galloway Hall  is the oldest dorm on the campus and has the typical arrangement of shared bathrooms for the entire hall. Galloway is typically considered to be a  freshman  dorm and has a social atmosphere. It underwent extensive renovations in 2006 and the elevators were renovated in 2008.   Graham-Hewlett  and  Belk  dormitories are configured in a suite-style arrangement with eight to ten individuals sharing a bathroom. Belk is the only dorm on campus which is exclusively female, as all other dorms are coed. Starting in 2008, Graham, Hewlett, and Belk Halls are arranged to hold additional students, with every other room housing three students (as opposed to the usual two). This has been done to accommodate the increasingly larger freshmen classes and prevent outsourcing housing to local hotels, as was done in the past when housing was overbooked.   Constructed in the 1980s,  Schwartz Hall  has shared bathrooms but is distinguished by its unusual square layout in contrast with the typical hall style dorms. Several of the floors on Schwartz are designated as ""study floors"" and require the residents to abide by stricter regulations.   The newer dormitories include  Honors ,  International , and  Cornerstone Hall  -- which are arranged with a courtyard between them to form what is referred to as "" Tri-house "". These dormitories were constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s and are considered to be the most luxurious and well-maintained freshmen residences on campus.   In addition to the dormitories, UNCW also has on campus apartments and suites. There are 13 apartment buildings which can serve as home to 400 students. The Apartments house 4 students, who all have separate bedrooms but share a bathroom, living room, and kitchen. The apartments were extensively renovated in 2002 and now boast marble counter tops, tiled bathrooms, and new appliances.   The Suites, built in the late 1980s have two separate floor-plans which are divided by a breeze-way and set of stairs. There are 7 suite buildings which can also house 400 students. Each floor of the suites consists of a singles and doubles 'pod' The doubles pod consists of 6 bedrooms housing 12 students. The singles pod consists of 10 private bedrooms housing 10 students. All residents of the Suites share bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. As of 2008 the Suites have not been renovated. Starting with the 07-08 school year, the suites now house various sororities and the apartments house fraternities in addition to their previous function of housing the university's sports teams. The idea is for the suites and apartments to eventually become completely Greek.   The University has recently completed the construction of  Seahawk Village , a luxury apartment complex designed to compete with off-campus accommodations. Seahawk Village comprises six (6) apartment buildings and a club house with swimming pool. The complex is constructed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style that is consistent with campus. The Village includes a mix of 2,3, and 4 bedroom apartments with a total of (524) beds. The apartments are fully furnished and provided with wireless internet, cable TV, and local telephone service. They feature a full service kitchen and washer and dryer in each apartment.   In the Fall of 2006, as a part of UNCWs initiative to expand on-campus housing for 40% of undergraduate students, the  Seahawk Landing  residence facility was opened, featuring living arrangements similar to that found in the Seahawk Village facility, with expanded amenities such as a sandwich/coffee shop, convenience market, and small-scale recreation facility located on local site.   In 2008, construction began on the third phase of this residential expansion, which has been dubbed  Seahawk Crossing . Construction of these facilities, which includes the construction of a multi-level parking deck, involved leveling several acres of long-leaf pine forest, which promulgated a vociferous, but ultimately unheard student movement to block the destruction of what became known as the UNCW forest. As of December 2008, extensive progress has been made on the site, and the facilities are expected to be open by August of 2009.   All students who live on campus are subject to University rules and regulations and are required to have an on-campus meal plan. (With the exception of Seahawk Village residents.) All residences have an RA, or Resident Assistant, who is always a student, on each hall and are administered by an RC or Residential Coordinator who is a university staff member who lives on campus in the residence they are responsible for.   With the exception of the apartments, suites, and Seahawk Village apartments, all students are required to show identification to the DR, or Desk Attendant upon entering the various residential buildings.     [ edit ]   Off-Campus Housing   There are many apartments and condos that UNCW students live in. The Seahawk Perch which is maintained by the Dean of Students Office oversees off campus students.  More information about UNCW apartments can be found at  Seahawk Perch     [ edit ]   Campus Dining   UNCW has several options for campus dining. The primary venue for dining on campus is Wagoner Hall, which is affectionately referred to as the ""Wag"" by students. Wagoner Hall serves as a standard dining hall setup, with various stations offering a variety of foods, including a salad bar and assorted desserts. Wagoner Hall is also host to ""Wagsgiving"", an annual Thanksgiving feast arranged for students.   The newly renovated University Union now houses The Hawk's Nest where students can choose from: Jole Mole which serves Mexican cuisine, the Tuscan Oven which serves pizza and breadsticks, the Hawk Wok which serves Asian Cuisine including broth bowls and many other delicious dishes, the Varsity Grill which serves hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, there is a Sushi Station where you can custom make your sushi, Chick-fil-A and Quiznos. [ 2 ]   As is typical with most college campuses, UNCW's dining services are entirely controlled by  Aramark , whose contract demands the inclusion of meal plans in most, but not all, residential fees. The overwhelming majority of students find the quality of campus dining unremarkable, but maintain that it is still superior to most other UNC system schools' options.     [ edit ]   Academics     [ edit ]   Academic Profile     The university is organized in to five colleges:     College of Arts and Sciences   Cameron School of Business   School of Nursing   Watson School of Education   Graduate School     The university has 73 undergraduate degree programs, 30 masters degree programs, and two doctoral programs.     [ edit ]   Randall Library   William Madison Randall Library  supports the mission of the UNCW through the provision of information resources, services and programs relevant to the needs of its students, faculty and staff. It also serves as a rich cultural resource for the surrounding community and the region. To accomplish this mission, the library provides (1) diverse collections of informational resources in multiple formats; (2) efficient access to informational resources; (3) assistance and instruction in identifying, evaluating and interpreting information; (4) a safe and comfortable facility which stimulates intellectual curiosity and reflective thinking; and (5) programs that connect scholars and interested individuals with information and expertise to inspire lifelong learning such as the library workshop series.   Randall Library also boasts an extensive electronic reserves catalogue that is frequently utilized by faculty in reading assignments.     [ edit ]   2008 - 2009 Rankings   In 2008,  Forbes  ranked UNCW second among the public universities in North Carolina, behind only  UNC Chapel Hill [ 3 ] .   Kiplinger :     3rd ""Best Value"" for in-state students among public universities in North Carolina.   25th ""Best Value"" for in-state students among public universities in the United States.   35th ""Best Value"" for out-of-state students among public universities in the United States.     It is also important to note that among its peer institutions (public master's universities), UNC Wilmington ranks fourth nationally (behind James Madison, College of New Jersey, and Truman State). [ 4 ]   U.S. News & World Report :     Top 10 (currently 6th) public master's universities in the south for the past decade.     UNC Wilmington climbed to 6th among the top public master's universities in the South in 2008 (the university was ranked 7th in 2007). The university also saw a jump in their overall ranking among both public and private master's universities in the South, climbing from 20th to 14th. [ 5 ]   The most recent 26th edition (2004) of Barron's Profiles of American Colleges lists UNCW at the ""very competitive"" level, whereas the Carnegie Foundation classifies UNC Wilmington as ""more selective"". [ 6 ]  Only four UNC institutions are rated ""very competitive"": NC State, Appalachian State, UNC Asheville, and UNC Wilmington. UNC Chapel Hill is the only institution rated at the higher ""most competitive"" level.   Among UNC system institutions, UNCW has the 2nd-highest 4-year graduation rate (42.8), 3rd-highest 6-year graduation rate (65.1), and 4th-highest freshman-to-sophomore retention rate (83.1). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Athletics     The UNCW athletic teams for both men and women are known as the  Seahawks . They are a member of the  NCAA's  Division I and compete in the  Colonial Athletic Association . There are 19 varsity athletic teams for men and women. UNCW has the best student-athlete graduation for non-football playing Division I public universities in the state, with 74 percent.   The Men's Basketball team has won the CAA Championship in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006.   In their first trip to the  NCAA Tournament , they lost to the 2nd seeded  Cincinnati  64 to 47.   In their second trip (2002), the 13th seeded Seahawks shocked the 4th seeded Trojans of  USC  with a 93-89  overtime  win. They were defeated by  Indiana  in the second round, 76-66.   The third trip (2003) had the Seahawks face off  Maryland . Aaron Coombs sank 2 free throws with 5 seconds left, giving the Seahawks a 72-73 lead and putting them in position to pull off a tourney surprise for the second year in a row. Instead, Maryland won the game 75-73 with the help of a nearly half court buzzer beater 3-point shot. Freshman John Goldsberry set an  NCAA Tournament  record by shooting 8 for 8 on 3-point shots.   In 2006 they earned a 9th seed, their highest ever seed, and faced off against the underrated #8 seed George Washington Colonials. GW was slotted to get a #4-#7 seed, so the Seahawks had a tougher 1st round opponent than most #9 seeds. Despite an excellent 1st half, the Seahawks blew a 18 point lead in the second half and lost in overtime 88-85.   In 06-07 they posted a dismal 7-22 record. Next year in th 07-08 season their record was 20-13 and missed post season play. It was T.J. Carter's last season for the Seahawks.   Men's Swim team has won the CAA title for 6 consecutive years, from 2002 through 2007.   Men's Track & Field team won their CAA record 9th team title in 2008.   UNCW's athletics facilities are regarded as some of the best in the southeastern part of the state. They include Brooks Field for baseball, the Trask Coliseum for basketball, the Seahawk Natatorium for swimming and Boseman Field (named after local state Senator  Julia Boseman ) for softball.

Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a  women's college  by legislative enactment on  February 18 ,  1891  as the  State Normal and Industrial School  and opened  October 5 ,  1892 . The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original 10 acre site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.   The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the ""State Normal and Industrial School"" to the  State Normal and Industrial College  in 1896, and again in 1919 to  North Carolina College for Women . In 1932, it changed to the  Woman's College of the University of North Carolina , when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro  when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as ""the W.C.""   Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.     [ edit ]   Recognition   The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG #2 in its list of best bargains in public universities in the nation. [ 1 ]  It also placed UNCG in the top 136 colleges named ""Best in the Southeast."" For the eighth year in a row,  The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG among the nation's top colleges in the 2007 edition of ""The Best 357 Colleges"" guide. Students say UNCG ""is a small university in comparison to other public universities, but it is big enough for a variety of people  poor and rich, rural and urban, in-state and out-of-state, and international.""   Kiplinger's ranks UNCG as one of the 100 best values among public, 4-year schools in the United States. Six other North Carolina institutions made the listAppalachian State, East Carolina, NC State, UNC-Asheville, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UNC-Wilmington.   The UNCG School of Nursing has received one of the top national honors by the National League of Nursing, which named the school a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education, a distinction held by only three other schools in the country for 2006. [ 2 ]   UNCG's Counselor Education program is among the best in the nation. [ citation needed ]  US News and World Report-The Department of Counseling and Educational Development is ranked second (nationally) among counseling programs in the magazines 2006-2007 list. The program  the only specialty education program in the state to be ranked  was ranked fifth last year and third the year before.   The School of Education is 73rd in the country for 2008. [ 3 ]  UNC-Chapel Hill is the only other North Carolina school in the top 50, coming in at 31st place. Previously, UNCG was ranked 29th.

[ edit ]   Campus          The Fountain in front of the Dining Halls       UNCG has an architecturally diverse campus with distinctively unique landmarks. [ 4 ]  Among these features is a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.   Other landmarks include ""Charlie,"" a statue of the University's founder  Charles Duncan McIver  outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to ""the Rawk"" and the clock towertwo campus landmarksand school traditions ( See Traditions below ). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed at the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.   The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and ""the Caf,"" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.   The campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities   North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University ,  Duke ,  Elon ,  High Point University ,  NC State ,  UNC-Chapel Hill ,  UNC Charlotte ,  Wake Forest , and  Winston-Salem State University .

Main article:  UNC Greensboro Spartans          UNCG Spartans logo       The intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s during the days of the WCUNC, with students participating in national golf tournaments in 1948 and the school hosting the national tournaments for women's golf (1954) and tennis (1965). During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the  National Collegiate Athletic Association , and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991.   Men's Soccer team:   Under Michael Parkers direction, the mens soccer team became the first in NCAA history to win three consecutive national championships, in 1985, 1986 and 1987.   UNCG Soccer Stadium, a $3.6 million facility, opened for its first game on September 7, 1991.   1997: SoCon Regular Season Champions. 1998: SoCon Regular Season Champions. 2004: Was ranked #1 in the country for 11 weeks.

The Spartans lost to Cincinnati in the NCAA Tournament, 66-61. The five seniors from the team had their numbers honored. Scott Hartzell finished his career as the mens basketballs all-time leading scorer with 1,539.   On March 4, 2001, the mens basketball team won its first Southern Conference championship on David Schucks buzzer-beating layup.

Guard Nathan Jameson was named first-team Verizon Academic All-America.   On December 31, 2005, UNCG hosted top-ranked Duke at the Greensboro Coliseum in front of a record crowd of 21,124. The near capacity crowd was the largest to ever see a UNCG athletic event.   Beginning with the 2009-2010 season, the men's basketball team will host all of its home games in the Greensboro Coliseum. The arena, which holds over 21,000 seats, will be configured to hold just under 8,000 spectators for most games. The coliseum will be renovated to feature a UNCG court design and locker rooms.   Baseball:   On April 18, 2006, UNCG earned its first win over a top-ranked team in any sport during the universitys Division I era. The baseball team beat top-ranked North Carolina, 7-6, in front of a crowd of 1,033.

It was UNCGs first-ever win over a Big East school and the programs first victory over Wake Forest since 1977.   In March 2006, the UNCG womens basketball team made its first SoCon Tournament title game appearance since 2002. The Spartans rallied from nearly all of a 21-point deficit, closing to within three in the final four minutes. However, Chattanooga pulled away late for a 91-79 win.

National Interfraternity Music Council     Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia   Mu Phi Epsilon   Sigma Alpha Iota       [ edit ]   Traditions   Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where ""The Rawk"" and the clock tower are located.     [ edit ]   The Rawk   The Rawk [ 6 ]  is a large boulder donated by members of  Alpha Phi Omega  in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.   The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's ""Rawkin' Welcome Week,"" which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.     [ edit ]   Clock Towers   Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.   Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.   A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the  Big Ben  chimes.     [ edit ]   Other traditions   It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisythe school flower of UNCGafter student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 ""to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms."" [ 7 ] ) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.   Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.

If you are considering getting a paralegal degree online, whether an associates, bachelors or even masters, you may already be aware that there are a great many online paralegal degree programs offering courses and diplomas.  Some are already respected and others are rather fly by night.  Nearly all claim to be accredited, but some are not recognized by state boards of higher education- an important detail that can be checked out in your state, often online.  Here are some of the courses you might be required to take. Remember that the specific paralegal courses you must take will depend both on the program you choose (which online paralegal college or university) as well as the specific concentration area.                                                                                                                                                  PARALEGAL STUDIES CONCENTRATION                    (A more general paralegal concentration)                        Introduction to Law for the Paralegal      Introduction to Legal Research and Writing      Debtor/Creditor Relations      Business Organizations I       Estates and Trusts I      Civil Trial and Appellate Practice I       Real Estate for the Paralegal       Civil Trial and Appellate Practice II                                                                                                 HUMAN RESOURCES CONCENTRATION:                   Financial Management       Human Resource Management       Computer Applications in Business      Organizational Behavior       Introduction to Law for the Paralegal       Introduction to Legal Research and Writing       Business Organizations I       Civil Trial and Appellate Practice I      Real Estate for the Paralegal       Employment Law                                                                                                                              LAW OFFICE MANAGEMENT CONCENTRATION:                    Small Business Management       Human Resource Management      Organizational Behavior       Law Office Management       Introduction to Law for the Paralegl      Introduction to Legal Research and Writing       Business Organizations I      Civil Trial and Appellate Practice I      Real Estate for the Parlegal      Employment Law                                          How long does an online Paralegal program take? that depends largely on how many classes you take at one time. Most online paralegal degree programs are very flexible about how long you take to complete your degree, so it may be possible to complete it in as little as a year, while many online students take a year and a half to two years and some take three or more.  As you consider which program to take, consider going with a school that already has a proven track record and good reputation in paralegal studies and higher education in general, so that it won't be difficult for others to believe you have actually earned your degree, while developing skills and gaining knowledge, and are now as qualified as anyone taking a traditional classroom-based paralegal program program.                                                                                                                                                Funny Paralegal jokes and humorous lawyer stories...                   A paralegal, an associate and a partner of a large law firm are walking through a city park, when they spotted an antique oil lamp.                                     The paralegal picked it up, but both the associate and partner grabbed for it, arguing that they found it first. Their tussling had the effect of rubbing the lamp, and to their shock a Genie emerged in a great cloud of smoke.                                     The Genie announced, ""In gratitude of your freeing me from the lamp, I grant you three wishes. As there are three of you, you each get one wish.""                                     The paralegal blurts out, ""I want to be in the Barbados, sipping cocktails with a gorgeous movie star."" Poof! The paralegal was gone.                                     The associate, excited by the events, stammers, ""I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with a professional hula dancer on one side and a Mai Tai on the other."" Poof! The associate was gone.                                     ""You're last,"" the Genie says to the partner, ""What is your wish?""                                     The partner replied, ""I want those two back in the office after lunch.""                                                                                A judge, bored and frustrated by a lawyer's tedious arguments, had made numerous rulings to speed the trial along. The attorney had bristled at the judge's orders, and their tempers grew hot.                        Finally, frustrated with another repetition of arguments he had heard many times before, the judge pointed to his ear and said, ""Counselor, you should be aware that at this point, what you are saying is just going in one ear and out the other.""                        ""Your honor,"" replied the lawyer, ""That goes without saying. What is there to prevent it?""                                          At the start of an important trial, a small town attorney called his first witness to the stand. She seemed like a sweet, elderly woman. He approached her and asked, ""Mrs. Jones, do you know me?""                        She responded, ""Why, yes, I do know you Mr. Williams. I've known you since you were a young boy. You've become a huge disappointment to me. You lie, you cheat on your wife, you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a hot shot lawyer, when you haven't the brains to realize you never will amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.""                        The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do he pointed across the room and asked, ""Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?""                        She replied, ""Why, of course I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a youngster, too. I used to baby-sit him for his parents. And he, also, is a real disappointment. He's lazy, bigoted, never has a nice word to say about anybody, and he drinks like a fish. He's been divorced five times, and everybody knows that his law practice is one of the shoddiest in the entire state. Yes, I know him.""                        The judge rapped his gavel, to quiet the tittering among the spectators in the courtroom. Once the room was silent, he called both attorneys to his bench. In a quiet, menacing voice, he warned, ""If either of you asks her if she knows me, you'll be jailed for contempt!""

The university opened on September 23, 1946. Today, it is the fastest growing school [ citation needed ]  in the 17 institution  University of North Carolina System .

The city of Charlotte had sought a public university since 1771 but was never able to sustain one. For years, the nearest state-supported university was 90 miles (140 km) away.   Like many of the  United States ' "" post-World War II "" universities, it owes its inception to the  G.I. Bill  and its effects on  public education . In 1949, when the state closed the centers, the Charlotte Center was taken over by the city school district and became  Charlotte College , a two-year institution. Funded first by student tuition payments, then by local property taxes, it became state-supported in 1958 upon joining the newly formed  North Carolina Community College System . Classes were held at Central High School, near uptown Charlotte, until the school moved to its current location in 1961.   In 1963, UNC Charlotte became a four-year college. It adopted its current name  July 1 ,  1965 , upon becoming part of the Consolidated University of North Carolina System, since 1972 called the  University of North Carolina System . In 1969, the university began offering programs leading to masters degrees. In 1992, it was authorized to offer programs leading to doctoral degrees.

This new quad-style area was completed in 2007 with the completion of the College of Health and Human Services (left) and the College of Education (right). The clock tower of the Barnhardt Student Activity Center is in the background. Upon completion of the new Student Union, this will be one of the busiest areas on the entire campus.         [ edit ]   Main Campus - University City   The University operates several campuses in Charlotte. The Main Campus is situated on just under 1,000  acres  (4 km) of rolling land between  U.S. Highway 29  and  N.C. Highway 49 , about 10 miles (16 km) from Uptown Charlotte in the  University City  neighborhood. The campus is self-contained, meaning that no major roads run through the campus. The campus boasts several  manmade  lakes, and is heavily wooded. Near the center of campus are two gardens that attract over 300,000 visitors a year. Much of the architecture on the campus, particularly the oldest buildings, are precast concrete and utilitarian-looking because they were built with limited state funds in the 1960s and 1970s. Under the campus' third chancellor, James Woodward, the campus has and is undergoing a major change. The newest buildings, funded from state bonds, are being constructed in brick with neoclassical architecture. Concrete and asphalt sidewalks have largely been replaced by brick. The campus' road system is being upgraded to include landscaped medians and more trees.     [ edit ]   Charlotte Research Institute Campus   Attached to the main campus is a 100 acre (0.4 km) campus, created in 2000, called the  Charlotte Research Institute  (CRI Campus). This research-oriented campus focuses on precision metrology and intelligent manufacturing; opto-electronics and optical communication; and software and information technology. This campus brings together faculty, students, and outside researchers to work together.     [ edit ]   Uptown Charlotte Campus   The third campus is located in Uptown Charlotte. This campus primarily focuses its attention on business and evening courses, which caters to Uptown workers. Currently located in the Mint Museum of Craft+Design, the campus recently announced plans to construct its own building in Uptown. This project is still in the planning phase.          Uptown Campus in the Mint Museum of Craft + Design.         [ edit ]   South Charlotte Campus (Ballantyne)   The fourth campus is located in an area of South Charlotte called Ballantyne. At this campus, the University's College of Computing and Informatics (formerly the College of Information Technology [ 2 ] ) offers a limited number of graduate courses.

Murrey Atkins Library system, named for the first chairman of the Board of Trustees of Charlotte College, has over a million books, diverse electronic and media resources, as well as an area for special collections. The recently renovated library includes a ten story tower that accentuates the library's place at the heart of UNC Charlotte's campus.

[ edit ]   Athletics          Charlotte 49ers logo           Main article:  Charlotte 49ers       For athletics purposes, the school is known as simply  Charlotte , a change made official by the athletic department on August 23, 2000. The athletic department sponsors sixteen varsity teams and competes in the NCAA's Division I. The university has been a full member of the  Atlantic 10 Conference  since 2005. Charlotte is considered a I-AAA member of Division I since the university does not have football; a grassroots movement has emerged with the goal of energizing financial support to bring college football to Charlotte. On September 18, 2008, Chancellor Dubois recommended to add a  Division I-AA  football program to UNC Charlotte. On November 13, 2008, the UNC Charlotte Board of Trustees voted 8-0 in favor of adding football to the University.   The nickname of the athletic team is the  49ers , indicative of the fact that UNC Charlotte (then Charlotte College) was saved from permanent closure in 1949. The mascot is ""Norm the Niner,"" an old miner. The school's colors are green and white; gold and black are both featured in the logo and frequently used in the uniforms of several sports.   Men's basketball is the most followed sport on campus. The team, currently coached by Bobby Lutz, has reached the  NCAA Tournament  eleven times, including a trip to the Final Four in 1977.  NBA  players that once suited up for the 49ers include  Boston Celtics  great  Cedric Maxwell ,  DeMarco Johnson ,  2001 NBA Draft  lottery pick  Rodney White , and  Eddie Basden .   Women's basketball has seen a surge in popularity on campus over the past several years, with the 2003 team, led by coach  Katie Meier , reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time. The team has made the WNIT in every season since then. Meier was succeeded in 2005 by  Amanda Butler , who left after two seasons to take over the same position at the  University of Florida .  Karen Aston  took the reins for the 2007-08 season.   Baseball has also experienced a resurgence at Charlotte, with the 2007 team posting a school-record 49 wins under coach  Loren Hibbs  and winning two games over  N.C. State  in the  NCAA Tournament .   The men's soccer team reached the  College Cup  in 1996. 49ers soccer players now playing in the  MLS  include  Floyd Franks  and  Jon Busch .   In September 2007, the Charlotte golf team became the top-rated golf team in the nation.  [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Student organizations       Main article:  List of UNC Charlotte student organizations       A large number of student organizations, most notably ' Niner Nation Gold ,' are associated with the university. Ranging from Academic, Graduate, Honor Societies, Interest, International, Multicultural, Political, Religious, Service and Sports. Greek Life, there are over 10 sororities and 14 fraternities at UNC Charlotte.     [ edit ]   University name   The official name of the university is ""The University of North Carolina at Charlotte."" ""Charlotte"" and ""UNC Charlotte"" (no hyphen) are both acceptable nicknames for the university, but the athletic department has used  Charlotte  exclusively for its sports teams since 2000. Issues of school identity persist and have led many people, including Charlotte Mayor  Pat McCrory , to call for a name change to ""The University of Charlotte."" Despite these confusions there is a group of people against the name change, including current chancellor Philip Dubois. The group cites arguments such as a fear of alienating of alumni, and the fact that the University of North Carolina system's name is so prestigious. The Student Government Association has passed a resolution to let the students vote on a University name change to the ""University of Charlotte"" during a special election to be held in the spring semester of 2009.     [ edit ]   University nickname   The nickname, the 49ers, was chosen in recognition of the importance of the year 1949 in the history of the university. UNC Charlotte would have died in 1949 [ citation needed ]  had Bonnie Cone and her supporters not convinced the N.C. Legislature that Charlotte needed a permanent college. Charlotte College was established that year. It is fortuitous that the campus is also located on N.C. Highway 49 and that Charlotte has a rich gold mining history - the term ""49ers"" symbolizing gold mining even though the Charlotte area gold preceded the one in California by a number of years. A bronze statue of the 49ers Gold Miner sits in front of the Reese Administration building on campus. The statue recalls the region's history as a gold mining center and symbolizes the pioneering spirit and determination that has led to UNC Charlotte's dramatic growth.     [ edit ]   University logo     UNC Charlotte's logo has become one of the Charlotte region's most distinctive insignia. It symbolizes the university's link to the UNC system, to the Charlotte metropolitan region, and to the discipline of learning. The logo is suggestive of a ""crown,"" reminiscent of Britain's Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III, for whom the city of Charlotte is named. The ""crown"" also can be interpreted as a lamp of learning, a burning bush, an open book, the flowering of a plant or an individual, or a graduate in cap and gown. The letters ""UNC"" refer to The University of North Carolina, which was opened in 1795. The word ""Charlotte"" not only refers to the city but also to the surrounding 11-county metropolitan region, which is the university's primary service area, and the area from which it draws more than 12,500 of its students.    [ edit ]   Alma Mater   UNC Charlotte's Alma Mater has deep roots in the institution's history. It was part of an ""Academic Festival March"" composed for UNC Charlotte by  James Helme Sutcliffe , a Charlotte composer and music critic who lived in Germany at the time. Dr. Loy Witherspoon, a Professor of Religious Studies, commissioned the March in 1965 when he learned that Charlotte College would become a campus in The University of North Carolina system. The March was first performed in 1967 at the installation of Dean W. Colvard as UNC Charlotte's first chancellor. Afterwards, it was performed as a recessional at every Commencement during Dean W. Colvard's time as chancellor. When UNC Charlotte founder Bonnie Cone heard the March, she said, ""I can hear an alma mater in it,"" referring to a hymn-like refrain. Dr. Robert Rieke, a professor of history, also heard an alma mater in it.   On a 1990 trip to Germany, Rieke visited Sutcliffe, picked up a recording of the March, and began writing words to fit the final refrain. On Christmas Eve 1991, he sent Bonnie Cone the words and music as a Christmas present to her and to the university, from which he had retired a year earlier.   Chancellor James. H. Woodward approved the composition as the university's Alma Mater in April 1992. It was sung for the first time at the following May Commencement and has been performed at every Commencement since.

( Discuss )         [ edit ]   Administration timeline         Chancellors of UNC Charlotte   Years as Chancellor       1   Bonnie Ethel Cone   (founder; director, 19461949; president, 19491965; acting chancellor, 19651966)       2   Dean Colvard   (19661978)       3   E.K. Fretwell   (19791989)       4   James Woodward   (19892005)       5   Phil Dubois   (2005current)         [ edit ]   Bonnie Ethel Cone , founder          Bonnie Cone's final resting place on the campus of UNC Charlotte, with Cato Hall and Fretwell Hall in the background.       Bonnie E. Cone  (1907-2003), or Miss Bonnie as she was known to students, was chosen to lead the Charlotte Center in 1946, and she was instrumental in convincing the state to keep the school open in 1949. She was the leader that chose the current site of the school, and helped plan the original campus master plan. Until 1965, she served as president of Charlotte College. She stated that  March 2 ,  1965  was the ""happiest day of her life""; it was the day the North Carolina  legislature  voted to bring Charlotte College into the UNC system. She served as an acting  Chancellor  of the university until 1966, when Dean Colvard was selected as permanent chancellor. Even though she had led the college since 1946, the State wanted a leader with experience of running a 4-year, public university. Cone and the university were profiled in the  July 16 ,  1965  issue of  TIME Magazine . In the article, she stated, ""we are not here to elevate ourselves but the institution"", when asked about the chancellor position. She served in various official positions until her retirement in 1973, at which time the main campus's student union was renamed the Cone University Center. Cone continued to work on behalf of the school in unofficial capacities until her death in March of 2003 . She is interred in the Van Landingham Gardens on the east side of the main campus, and a non-denominational meditation center is planned near the site. She is posthumously known as the founder of the school, a title which she rejected during her lifetime because she felt many people had a hand in creating and building the university. During her lifetime, she received 10  honorary degrees  from various colleges and universities and was inducted posthumously into the  Order of the Long Leaf Pine  in recognition to her contributions to North Carolina history. In 2004 the stretch of U.S. Highway 29 near the main campus was officially renamed the ""Dr. Bonnie Cone Memorial Highway.""     [ edit ]   Chancellors   Dean W. Colvard  (1913-2007) was appointed the first chancellor of the young university in 1966. A North Carolina native, Colvard had served as president of  Mississippi State University  (MSU). At MSU he was the first president to defy university policy of not playing against integrated teams when he ordered the men's basketball team to play  Loyola University Chicago  in 1963. At UNC Charlotte, Colvard took on the challenge of converting the school from a junior college to a 4-year member of the UNC system. He oversaw accreditation of the university, development of University Research Park (now one of the top 5 largest research parks in the country), constructed the first residence halls, created the first graduate programs, and grew the enrollment from about 1,700 to just over 8,000 students. He retired as chancellor in 1978, served as Chancellor  Emeritus  until his death. Colvard also received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. The Colvard building, completed on the main campus in 1979, is named in his honor and houses the Department of Psychology.   E.K. Fretwell , the second chancellor of the university, was named in 1979. Fretwell came to the university from  University at Buffalo , where he was president. Under Fretwell, campus enrollment surged from 8,000 students to over 12,000. He oversaw the creation of the Graduate School, created more graduate degrees, integrated the library's card catalog into the  Internet  in 1983, created the ground work for a major business incubator, helped to develop the university's surrounding neighborhood, and increased academic grants to over $6.1 million dollars. Fretwell retired as chancellor in 1989. He served as interim president of the  University of Massachusetts  from 1991-1992, and in 1998, he served as the interim president of the  University of North Florida . In 1996 UNC Charlotte opened the Fretwell building, dedicated in honor of him and his wife Dorrie. The building headquarters the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. He and his wife live in Charlotte.   James H. Woodward  succeeded Fretwell in 1989. Woodward came to UNC Charlotte from the  University of Alabama at Birmingham  where he served as dean of engineering and senior vice president of academic affairs. Under Woodward, enrollment grew to over 19,000 students. Like his predecessors, he continued the growth of the Graduate School, and added various new doctoral programs. He also oversaw the largest fundraising campaign in the school's history and its largest building boom; as of the summer of 2005, no less than six buildings were actively under construction on the main campus. Woodward also oversaw creation of the CRI Campus. Woodward announced his retirement in 2004, and left the office of chancellor on  June 30 ,  2005 . Woodward Hall, the main campus's newest science and technology building, was dedicated in his honor on November 16, 2005. Woodward is currently serving as Chancellor Emeritus and teaches in the university's engineering department.          Chancellor Phillip Dubois       ' Phil Dubois'  is the fourth and current chancellor, assuming his current duties on July 15, 2005. He returns to Charlotte after serving as the president of the  University of Wyoming  from 1997 through 2005 . Previously, Dubois served as the  Provost  and professor of political science at UNC Charlotte from 1991 until 1997.   Dubois is the first chancellor, along with his wife and children, to occupy the brand new Chancellor's House (known as the Bissell House) on the UNC Charlotte campus that was completed in the winter of 2005. Phil is expected to oversee the process of the University becoming the fourth research-extensive university in the State.     [ edit ]   Alumni and faculty       Main article:  List of University of North Carolina at Charlotte people       Every graduate of UNC Charlotte automatically becomes a member of the Alumni Association, an organization of more than 80,000 former students whose primary purpose is to advance the interests of the university. There are no membership fees, annual dues or initiation rites, but there is an expectation that members will be active participants in the organization. In addition to promoting the interests of UNC Charlotte, the Alumni Association acts as a network of UNC Charlotte graduates who assist each other in their personal, professional and social development, and recognize and cheer the accomplishments of their fellow members. The association offers members a number of benefits and services. Some are in the form of information and communications, including a UNC Charlotte magazine and a quarterly electronic newsletter which keeps alumni up to date on news from the association and the university. The only requirement for membership is that alumni maintain contact with the Office of Alumni Affairs, provide an up-to-date address for alumni files and keep the association informed about their personal progress and career achievements.

Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a  women's college  by legislative enactment on  February 18 ,  1891  as the  State Normal and Industrial School  and opened  October 5 ,  1892 . The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original 10 acre site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.   The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the ""State Normal and Industrial School"" to the  State Normal and Industrial College  in 1896, and again in 1919 to  North Carolina College for Women . In 1932, it changed to the  Woman's College of the University of North Carolina , when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro  when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as ""the W.C.""   Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.     [ edit ]   Recognition   The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG #2 in its list of best bargains in public universities in the nation. [ 1 ]  It also placed UNCG in the top 136 colleges named ""Best in the Southeast."" For the eighth year in a row,  The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG among the nation's top colleges in the 2007 edition of ""The Best 357 Colleges"" guide. Students say UNCG ""is a small university in comparison to other public universities, but it is big enough for a variety of people  poor and rich, rural and urban, in-state and out-of-state, and international.""   Kiplinger's ranks UNCG as one of the 100 best values among public, 4-year schools in the United States. Six other North Carolina institutions made the listAppalachian State, East Carolina, NC State, UNC-Asheville, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UNC-Wilmington.   The UNCG School of Nursing has received one of the top national honors by the National League of Nursing, which named the school a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education, a distinction held by only three other schools in the country for 2006. [ 2 ]   UNCG's Counselor Education program is among the best in the nation. [ citation needed ]  US News and World Report-The Department of Counseling and Educational Development is ranked second (nationally) among counseling programs in the magazines 2006-2007 list. The program  the only specialty education program in the state to be ranked  was ranked fifth last year and third the year before.   The School of Education is 73rd in the country for 2008. [ 3 ]  UNC-Chapel Hill is the only other North Carolina school in the top 50, coming in at 31st place. Previously, UNCG was ranked 29th. [ citation needed ]   UNCG was named as having the best chapter of  Phi Beta Kappa  in the country at a public university for the year 2006. [ citation needed ]  It is also the home institution of NC Poet Laureate emeritus Fred Chappell.   The University's endowment is ranked third among North Carolina's public institutions of higher learning (behind UNC-Chapel Hill and NC State University) and 275th nationally.     [ edit ]   Campus          The Fountain in front of the Dining Halls       UNCG has an architecturally diverse campus with distinctively unique landmarks. [ 4 ]  Among these features is a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliott University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.   Other landmarks include ""Charlie,"" a statue of the University's founder  Charles Duncan McIver  outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to ""the Rawk"" and the clock towertwo campus landmarksand school traditions ( See Traditions below ). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed at the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.   The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and ""the Caf,"" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.   The campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities   North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University ,  Duke ,  Elon ,  High Point University ,  NC State ,  UNC-Chapel Hill ,  UNC Charlotte ,  Wake Forest , and  Winston-Salem State University .

(March 2009)       Main article:  UNC Greensboro Spartans          UNCG Spartans logo       The intercollegiate athletics program at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro reaches as far back as the late 1940s during the days of the WCUNC, with students participating in national golf tournaments in 1948 and the school hosting the national tournaments for women's golf (1954) and tennis (1965). During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the  National Collegiate Athletic Association , and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991.   Men's Soccer team:   Under Michael Parkers direction, the mens soccer team became the first in NCAA history to win three consecutive national championships, in 1985, 1986 and 1987.   UNCG Soccer Stadium, a $3.6 million facility, opened for its first game on September 7, 1991.   1997: SoCon Regular Season Champions. 1998: SoCon Regular Season Champions. 2004: Was ranked #1 in the country for 11 weeks. SoCon Regular Season Champions. The UNCG's Men's Soccer team lost in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament to  UC-Santa Barbara's Men's Soccer  team, 1-0 in Overtime. 2005: SoCon Regular Season Champions. SoCon Tournament Champions.

Once again advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament and lost to Northwestern 1-2. 2007: Advanced to the SoCon Tournament Championship game and lost to Furman in Overtime. 2008: Went into the SoCon Tourny as the #7 seat. They shocked the conference by winning the SoCon Championship being the lowest seat to ever get to ever win the championship. During their unbelievable run, the Spartans knocked off Duke in the first round or the NCAA tournament, Loyola (MD) in overtime in the second round, and were the first team with a losing record to make it to the final 16 of the NCAA tournament with a losing record.

Men's Basketball:   On March 2, 1996, mens basketball knocked off Liberty, 79-53, to claim the Big South Tournament Championship and advance to the NCAA Tournament for the first time in Division I. The Spartans lost to Cincinnati in the NCAA Tournament, 66-61. The five seniors from the team had their numbers honored. Scott Hartzell finished his career as the mens basketballs all-time leading scorer with 1,539.   On March 4, 2001, the mens basketball team won its first Southern Conference championship on David Schucks buzzer-beating layup. The team went on to play top-ranked Stanford in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, its second trip to the ""Big Dance"" in five years. Guard Nathan Jameson was named first-team Verizon Academic All-America.   On December 31, 2005, UNCG hosted top-ranked Duke at the Greensboro Coliseum in front of a record crowd of 21,124. The near capacity crowd was the largest to ever see a UNCG athletic event.   Beginning with the 2009-2010 season, the men's basketball team will host all of its home games in the Greensboro Coliseum. The arena, which holds over 21,000 seats, will be configured to hold just under 8,000 spectators for most games. The coliseum will be renovated to feature a UNCG court design and locker rooms.   Baseball:   On April 18, 2006, UNCG earned its first win over a top-ranked team in any sport during the universitys Division I era. The baseball team beat top-ranked North Carolina, 7-6, in front of a crowd of 1,033.   Women's Basketball:   In December 2005, UNCGs womens basketball program enjoyed two of its greatest non-conference wins since moving to the Division I level. In a 12-day span, UNCG knocked off Big East foe West Virginia at home and ACC member Wake Forest on the road. It was UNCGs first-ever win over a Big East school and the programs first victory over Wake Forest since 1977.   In March 2006, the UNCG womens basketball team made its first SoCon Tournament title game appearance since 2002. The Spartans rallied from nearly all of a 21-point deficit, closing to within three in the final four minutes. However, Chattanooga pulled away late for a 91-79 win.   The 16 athletic teams currently at UNCG include:   Baseball, Men's Basketball, Women's Basketball, Men's Cross Country, Women's Cross Country, Men's Golf, Women's Golf, Men's Soccer, Women's Soccer, Softball, Men's Tennis, Women's Tennis, Men's Track, Women's Track, Women's Volleyball, and Wrestling.   The Blue Crew is a student organization dedicated to cheering on the Spartans at athletic events. The Blue Crew adds excitement to games and makes opposing teams feel incredibly unwelcome with a sea of blue/yellow tie dyed shirts and loud cheers.

The campus also includes numerous political organizations for students, including the College Republicans, College Democrats, College Libertarians and the International Socialist Organization and other activist groups including STAND, an organization focused on the situation in the Darfur region of Sudan.   Club Sports: Lacrosse (Men's), Equestrian, Fencing, Ice Hockey, Rugby (Men's), Rugby (Women's), Soccer (Men's), Swimming,  Ultimate Frisbee  (Men's and Women's) , Volleyball, Women's Soccer, Tennis     [ edit ]   Greek Life   UNCG is home to 20 Social Fraternities and Sororities that each have their own traditions. Their main event is Greek Week, a weeklong celebration of Greek life and team building games that take place each year in April.   The following Greek organizations are present at UNCG:   Interfraternity Conference:     Kappa Delta Rho   Lambda Chi Alpha   Pi Kappa Phi   Pi Kappa Alpha   Sigma Nu   Sigma Phi Epsilon   Theta Delta Chi     National Panhellenic Conference:     Alpha Chi Omega   Alpha Delta Pi   Chi Omega   Phi Mu   Sigma Sigma Sigma     National Pan-Hellenic Council Sororities:     Alpha Kappa Alpha   Delta Sigma Theta   Sigma Gamma Rho   Zeta Phi Beta     National Pan-Hellenic Council Fraternities:     Alpha Phi Alpha   Kappa Alpha Psi   Phi Beta Sigma     Council Independent:     Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc.       [ edit ]   Traditions   Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where ""The Rawk"" and the clock tower are located.     [ edit ]   The Rawk   The Rawk [ 6 ]  is a large boulder donated by members of  Alpha Phi Omega  in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.   The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's ""Rawkin' Welcome Week,"" which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.     [ edit ]   Clock Towers   Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.   Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.   A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the  Big Ben  chimes.     [ edit ]   Other traditions   It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisythe school flower of UNCGafter student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 ""to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms."" [ 7 ] ) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.   Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.

In 1965, under the leadership of Robert Watson, creative writing offerings were formalized. Since that time, enrollment has grown, but the faculty has intentionally kept the program small, enabling students to have individual conferences with faculty. Notable faculty members have included  Fred Chappell ,  H.T. Kirby-Smith , Michael Parker,  Craig Nova ,  Stuart Dischell ,  Jennifer Grotz  and  David Roderick . Notable graduates include  Claudia Emerson ,  Steve Almond ,  Keith Lee Morris , Lee Hadaway and  Rodney Jones .

In addition to freshmen and sophomores, those who have graduated from the program and are rising juniors or seniors may apply to be Mary Foust upperclassmen. Typically 8-12 or so juniors and seniors are selected each year to continue living in Mary Foust as mentors. Each upperclassman is required to complete an ""upperclassman project."" These projects are typically activities that support community interaction within Mary Foust.   Many Mary Foust alumni continue to support and participate in Ashby Residential College. Many of the staff are alumni.     [ edit ]   Notable alumni     Steve Almond  - Author of  Candyfreak,  ""My Life in Heavy Metal,"" and ""The Evil B.B. Chow.""

Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a  women's college  by legislative enactment on  February 18 ,  1891  as the  State Normal and Industrial School  and opened  October 5 ,  1892 . The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original 10 acre site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.   The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the ""State Normal and Industrial School"" to the  State Normal and Industrial College  in 1896, and again in 1919 to  North Carolina College for Women . In 1932, it changed to the  Woman's College of the University of North Carolina , when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro  when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as ""the W.C.""   Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.     [ edit ]   Recognition   The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG #2 in its list of best bargains in public universities in the nation [ citation needed ] .

For the eighth year in a row,  The Princeton Review  ranked UNCG among the nation's top colleges in the 2007 edition of ""The Best 357 Colleges"" guide. Students say UNCG ""is a small university in comparison to other public universities, but it is big enough for a variety of people  poor and rich, rural and urban, in-state and out-of-state, and international.""   Kiplinger's ranks UNCG as one of the 100 best values among public, 4-year schools in the United States. Six other North Carolina institutions made the listAppalachian State, East Carolina, NC State, UNC-Asheville, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UNC-Wilmington.   The UNCG School of Nursing has received one of the top national honors for nursing schools. [ citation needed ]  The National League of Nursing named the school a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education, a distinction held by only three other schools in the country for 2006.   UNCG's Counselor Education program is among the best in the nation.

[ edit ]   Campus          The Fountain in front of the Dining Halls       UNCG has an intimate campus [ citation needed ]  with distinctively unique landmarks. Among these features is a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliot University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.   Other landmarks include ""Charlie,"" a statue of the University's founder  Charles Duncan McIver  outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to ""the Rawk"" and the clock towertwo campus landmarksand school traditions ( See Traditions below ). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed at the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.   The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and ""the Caf,"" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.   The campus is in close proximity (within 1.5 hours drive) to many other universities   North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University ,  Duke ,  Elon ,  High Point University ,  NC State ,  UNC-Chapel Hill ,  UNC Charlotte ,  Wake Forest , and  Winston-Salem State University .

The following Greek organizations are present at UNCG:   Interfraternity Conference:     Kappa Delta Rho   Lambda Chi Alpha   Pi Kappa Phi   Sigma Nu   Sigma Phi Epsilon   Theta Delta Chi     National Panhellenic Conference:     Alpha Chi Omega   Alpha Delta Pi   Chi Omega   Phi Mu   Sigma Sigma Sigma     National Pan-Hellenic Council Sororities:     Alpha Kappa Alpha   Delta Sigma Theta   Sigma Gamma Rho   Zeta Phi Beta     National Pan-Hellenic Council Fraternities:     Alpha Phi Alpha   Kappa Alpha Psi   Phi Beta Sigma     Council Independent:     Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc.       [ edit ]   Traditions   Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where ""The Rawk"" and the clock tower are located.     [ edit ]   The Rawk   The Rawk [ 2 ]  is a large boulder donated by members of  Alpha Phi Omega  in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.   The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's ""Rawkin' Welcome Week,"" which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.     [ edit ]   Clock Towers   Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.   Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.   A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the  Big Ben  chimes.     [ edit ]   Other traditions   It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisythe school flower of UNCGafter student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 ""to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms."" [ 3 ] ) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.   Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.

Credit for the founding of UNCG goes mainly to Charles Duncan McIver, a crusader for the cause of women's education. The school was established as a  women's college  by legislative enactment on  February 18 ,  1891  as the  State Normal and Industrial School  and opened  October 5 ,  1892 . The school provided instruction in business, domestic science, and teaching with a student body of 223 and a faculty of 15 in its first year. R. S. Pullen and R. T. Gray gave the original 10 acre site in Greensboro, N.C. where the first building was erected with state funds totaling $30,000.   The school has seen many names over the years, changing from the ""State Normal and Industrial School"" to the  State Normal and Industrial College  in 1896, and again in 1919 to  North Carolina College for Women . In 1932, it changed to the  Woman's College of the University of North Carolina , when it became one of the three charter institutions of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, and changed again to  The University of North Carolina at Greensboro  when men were first admitted to the school in 1963. It is remembered fondly by many graduates of the Woman's College simply as ""the W.C.""   Charles D. McIver served the institution as its first chief executive officer with the title of President. This position has also seen various names, with the administrator being known as the Dean of Administration after 1934 and Chancellor from 1945 to present.

Among these features is a statue of Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, located to the east of Elliot University Center. Minerva has been a part of campus from the first diploma bearing her likeness in 1894 to the statue erected near the center in 2003. Minerva also inspired the university's new graphic identity program, which was launched in 2004.   Other landmarks include ""Charlie,"" a statue of the University's founder  Charles Duncan McIver  outside Jackson Library. The white tower stacks of the Jackson Library and the Spartan water tower are recognizable structures in the Greensboro community, and the campus is also home to ""the Rawk"" and the clock towertwo campus landmarksand school traditions ( See Traditions below ). A new bell tower at the corner of College Ave. and Spring Garden St. was completed at the end of the 2004-2005 academic year.   The Fountain is another landmark on UNCG's campus, and is a common meeting place for student groups. Visible from parts of the quad all the way to the Elliot University Center and from above in the Jackson Library and ""the Caf,"" the large steps and platform around the fountain are frequently home to demonstrations, performances, and fraternity/sorority functions.

During the 1980s, all Spartan teams competed in Division III (non-scholarship) and then Division II (scholarship) of the  National Collegiate Athletic Association , and all teams have competed in Division 1 since Fall 1991.   Men's Soccer team:   Under Michael Parkers direction, the mens soccer team became the first in NCAA history to win three consecutive national championships, in 1985, 1986 and 1987.

The arena, which holds over 21,000 seats, will be configured to hold just under 8,000 spectators for most games. The coliseum will be renovated to feature a UNCG court design and locker rooms.   Baseball:   On April 18, 2006, UNCG earned its first win over a top-ranked team in any sport during the universitys Division I era.

The following Greek organizations are present at UNCG:   Interfraternity Conference:     Kappa Delta Rho   Lambda Chi Alpha   Pi Kappa Phi   Sigma Nu   Sigma Phi Epsilon   Theta Delta Chi     National Panhellenic Conference:     Alpha Chi Omega   Alpha Delta Pi   Chi Omega   Phi Mu   Sigma Sigma Sigma     National Pan-Hellenic Council Sororities:     Alpha Kappa Alpha   Delta Sigma Theta   Sigma Gamma Rho   Zeta Phi Beta     National Pan-Hellenic Council Fraternities:     Alpha Phi Alpha   Kappa Alpha Psi   Phi Beta Sigma     Council Independent:     Theta Nu Xi Multicultural Sorority, Inc.       [ edit ]   Traditions   Some of the most visible traditions at UNCG take place between the University Dining Hall and the Elliott University Center where ""The Rawk"" and the clock tower are located.     [ edit ]   The Rawk   The Rawk [ 2 ]  is a large boulder donated by members of  Alpha Phi Omega  in 1973 and painted nearly every day by students, who use it as a giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know when they can begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.   The spelling of 'The Rawk' came about as a means to express the more iconic status of it. It is a part of UNCG's ""Rawkin' Welcome Week,"" which they host a venue of activities to welcome the incoming freshman at the university.     [ edit ]   Clock Towers   Most students at the University also uphold the tradition of not walking beneath the four-faced clock tower located near the Rawk. It is said that those who walk under the clock will not graduate on time, and some students believe in this almost religiously, avoiding the bricks around the clock tower as well. Only graduates and the occasional unbeliever walk through the middle of the four posts to read the plaque below the clocks.   Students are also told not to depend on the time shown on any of the clock's faces. All four faces tend to show slightly different times.   A new clock and bell tower, the Nicholas A. Vacc Bell Tower, was constructed in 2005 on the site of the old University Bell, at the corner of College Avenue and Spring Garden Street. The bells ring on the hour and on every quarter of the hour in a sequence made famous by the  Big Ben  chimes.     [ edit ]   Other traditions   It is also a tradition each year to give new students a Spartan pin and a daisythe school flower of UNCGafter student convocation. The daisy was the inspiration for the original two school colors: gold and white. (Navy blue was added to the color palette in 1987 ""to provide better visual contrast to publications, merchandise and athletic uniforms."" [ 3 ] ) Another tradition is the ringing of the University Bell to open the academic year at the start of each Fall Semester.   Yet another tradition is to put a wreath of daisies at the foot of the statue of Charles McIver at UNCG and on the grounds of the North Carolina state capitol on Founder's Day. This is done by the Alumni of the University.

The city of Charlotte had sought a public university since 1771 but was never able to sustain one. For years, the nearest state-supported university was 90 miles (140 km) away.   Like many of the  United States ' "" post-World War II "" universities, it owes its inception to the  G.I. Bill  and its effects on  public education . In 1949, when the state closed the centers, the Charlotte Center was taken over by the city school district and became  Charlotte College , a two-year institution. Funded first by student tuition payments, then by local property taxes, it became state-supported in 1958 upon joining the newly formed  North Carolina Community College System . Classes were held at Central High School, near uptown Charlotte, until the school moved to its current location in 1961.   In 1963, UNC Charlotte became a four-year college. It adopted its current name  July 1 ,  1965 , upon becoming part of the Consolidated University of North Carolina System, since 1972 called the  University of North Carolina System . In 1969, the university began offering programs leading to masters degrees. In 1992, it was authorized to offer programs leading to doctoral degrees.

This new quad-style area was completed in 2007 with the completion of the College of Health and Human Services (left) and the College of Education (right). The clock tower of the Barnhardt Student Activity Center is in the background. Upon completion of the new Student Union, this will be one of the busiest areas on the entire campus.         [ edit ]   Main Campus - University City   The University operates several campuses in Charlotte. The Main Campus is situated on just under 1,000  acres  (4 km) of rolling land between  U.S. Highway 29  and  N.C. Highway 49 , about 10 miles (16 km) from Uptown Charlotte in the  University City  neighborhood. The campus is self-contained, meaning that no major roads run through the campus. The campus boasts several  manmade  lakes, and is heavily wooded. Near the center of campus are two gardens that attract over 300,000 visitors a year. Much of the architecture on the campus, particularly the oldest buildings, are precast concrete and utilitarian-looking because they were built with limited state funds in the 1960s and 1970s. Under the campus' third chancellor, James Woodward, the campus has and is undergoing a major change. The newest buildings, funded from state bonds, are being constructed in brick with neoclassical architecture. Concrete and asphalt sidewalks have largely been replaced by brick. The campus' road system is being upgraded to include landscaped medians and more trees.     [ edit ]   Charlotte Research Institute Campus   Attached to the main campus is a 100 acre (0.4 km) campus, created in 2000, called the  Charlotte Research Institute  (CRI Campus). This research-oriented campus focuses on precision metrology and intelligent manufacturing; opto-electronics and optical communication; and software and information technology. This campus brings together faculty, students, and outside researchers to work together.     [ edit ]   Uptown Charlotte Campus   The third campus is located in Uptown Charlotte. This campus primarily focuses its attention on business and evening courses, which caters to Uptown workers. Currently located in the Mint Museum of Craft+Design, the campus recently announced plans to construct its own building in Uptown. This project is still in the planning phase.          Uptown Campus in the Mint Museum of Craft + Design.         [ edit ]   South Charlotte Campus (Ballantyne)   The fourth campus is located in an area of South Charlotte called Ballantyne. At this campus, the University's College of Computing and Informatics (formerly the College of Information Technology [ 2 ] ) offers a limited number of graduate courses. The University occupies space in an office building for this campus.     [ edit ]   Students   Of the approximately 23,300 (18,329 undergraduate) students enrolled at the school, 47 percent are male and 53 percent female. Students come from 50 states and 80 countries.

Murrey Atkins Library system, named for the first chairman of the Board of Trustees of Charlotte College, has over a million books, diverse electronic and media resources, as well as an area for special collections. The recently renovated library includes a ten story tower that accentuates the library's place at the heart of UNC Charlotte's campus. In April 2007, Atkins received its one millionth volume, a copy of  T. S. Eliot 's  The Waste Land .     [ edit ]   Endowment   With  $ 99.5  million  (as of August 21, 2006) for approximately 22,254 students, the University of North Carolina at Charlotte has the 4th largest per capita endowment [ citation needed ]  of any state of North Carolina public university at $4,623 per student.

[ edit ]   Athletics          Charlotte 49ers logo           Main article:  Charlotte 49ers       For athletics purposes, the school is known as simply  Charlotte , a change made official by the athletic department on August 23, 2000. The athletic department sponsors sixteen varsity teams and competes in the NCAA's Division I. The university has been a full member of the  Atlantic 10 Conference  since 2005. Charlotte is considered a I-AAA member of Division I since the university does not have football; a grassroots movement has emerged with the goal of energizing financial support to bring college football to Charlotte. On September 18, 2008, Chancellor Dubois recommended to add a  Division I-AA  football program to UNC Charlotte. On November 13, 2008, the UNC Charlotte Board of Trustees voted 8-0 in favor of adding football to the University.   The nickname of the athletic team is the  49ers , indicative of the fact that UNC Charlotte (then Charlotte College) was saved from permanent closure in 1949. The mascot is ""Norm the Niner,"" an old miner. The school's colors are green and white; gold and black are both featured in the logo and frequently used in the uniforms of several sports.   Men's basketball is the most followed sport on campus. The team, currently coached by Bobby Lutz, has reached the  NCAA Tournament  eleven times, including a trip to the Final Four in 1977.  NBA  players that once suited up for the 49ers include  Boston Celtics  great  Cedric Maxwell ,  DeMarco Johnson ,  2001 NBA Draft  lottery pick  Rodney White , and  Eddie Basden .   Women's basketball has seen a surge in popularity on campus over the past several years, with the 2003 team, led by coach  Katie Meier , reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time. The team has made the WNIT in every season since then. Meier was succeeded in 2005 by  Amanda Butler , who left after two seasons to take over the same position at the  University of Florida .  Karen Aston  took the reins for the 2007-08 season.   Baseball has also experienced a resurgence at Charlotte, with the 2007 team posting a school-record 49 wins under coach  Loren Hibbs  and winning two games over  N.C. State  in the  NCAA Tournament .   The men's soccer team reached the  College Cup  in 1996. 49ers soccer players now playing in the  MLS  include  Floyd Franks  and  Jon Busch .   In September 2007, the Charlotte golf team became the top-rated golf team in the nation.  [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Student organizations       Main article:  List of UNC Charlotte student organizations       A large number of student organizations, most notably ' Niner Nation Gold ,' are associated with the university. Ranging from Academic, Graduate, Honor Societies, Interest, International, Multicultural, Political, Religious, Service and Sports. Greek Life, there are over 10 sororities and 14 fraternities at UNC Charlotte.     [ edit ]   University name   The official name of the university is ""The University of North Carolina at Charlotte."" ""Charlotte"" and ""UNC Charlotte"" (no hyphen) are both acceptable nicknames for the university, but the athletic department has used  Charlotte  exclusively for its sports teams since 2000. Issues of school identity persist and have led many people, including Charlotte Mayor  Pat McCrory , to call for a name change to ""The University of Charlotte."" Despite these confusions there is a group of people against the name change, including current chancellor Philip Dubois. The group cites arguments such as a fear of alienating of alumni, and the fact that the University of North Carolina system's name is so prestigious. The Student Government Association has passed a resolution to let the students vote on a University name change to the ""University of Charlotte"" during a special election to be held in the spring semester of 2009.     [ edit ]   University nickname   The nickname, the 49ers, was chosen in recognition of the importance of the year 1949 in the history of the university. UNC Charlotte would have died in 1949 [ citation needed ]  had Bonnie Cone and her supporters not convinced the N.C. Legislature that Charlotte needed a permanent college. Charlotte College was established that year. It is fortuitous that the campus is also located on N.C. Highway 49 and that Charlotte has a rich gold mining history - the term ""49ers"" symbolizing gold mining even though the Charlotte area gold preceded the one in California by a number of years. A bronze statue of the 49ers Gold Miner sits in front of the Reese Administration building on campus. The statue recalls the region's history as a gold mining center and symbolizes the pioneering spirit and determination that has led to UNC Charlotte's dramatic growth.     [ edit ]   University logo     UNC Charlotte's logo has become one of the Charlotte region's most distinctive insignia. It symbolizes the university's link to the UNC system, to the Charlotte metropolitan region, and to the discipline of learning. The logo is suggestive of a ""crown,"" reminiscent of Britain's Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of King George III, for whom the city of Charlotte is named. The ""crown"" also can be interpreted as a lamp of learning, a burning bush, an open book, the flowering of a plant or an individual, or a graduate in cap and gown. The letters ""UNC"" refer to The University of North Carolina, which was opened in 1795. The word ""Charlotte"" not only refers to the city but also to the surrounding 11-county metropolitan region, which is the university's primary service area, and the area from which it draws more than 12,500 of its students.    [ edit ]   Alma Mater   UNC Charlotte's Alma Mater has deep roots in the institution's history. It was part of an ""Academic Festival March"" composed for UNC Charlotte by  James Helme Sutcliffe , a Charlotte composer and music critic who lived in Germany at the time. Dr. Loy Witherspoon, a Professor of Religious Studies, commissioned the March in 1965 when he learned that Charlotte College would become a campus in The University of North Carolina system. The March was first performed in 1967 at the installation of Dean W. Colvard as UNC Charlotte's first chancellor. Afterwards, it was performed as a recessional at every Commencement during Dean W. Colvard's time as chancellor. When UNC Charlotte founder Bonnie Cone heard the March, she said, ""I can hear an alma mater in it,"" referring to a hymn-like refrain. Dr. Robert Rieke, a professor of history, also heard an alma mater in it.   On a 1990 trip to Germany, Rieke visited Sutcliffe, picked up a recording of the March, and began writing words to fit the final refrain. On Christmas Eve 1991, he sent Bonnie Cone the words and music as a Christmas present to her and to the university, from which he had retired a year earlier.   Chancellor James. H. Woodward approved the composition as the university's Alma Mater in April 1992. It was sung for the first time at the following May Commencement and has been performed at every Commencement since.     [ edit ]   Leaders of the university             It has been suggested that this section be  split  into a new article entitled  History of University of North Carolina at Charlotte . ( Discuss )         [ edit ]   Administration timeline         Chancellors of UNC Charlotte   Years as Chancellor       1   Bonnie Ethel Cone   (founder; director, 19461949; president, 19491965; acting chancellor, 19651966)       2   Dean Colvard   (19661978)       3   E.K.

Bonnie E. Cone  (1907-2003), or Miss Bonnie as she was known to students, was chosen to lead the Charlotte Center in 1946, and she was instrumental in convincing the state to keep the school open in 1949. She was the leader that chose the current site of the school, and helped plan the original campus master plan. Until 1965, she served as president of Charlotte College. She stated that  March 2 ,  1965  was the ""happiest day of her life""; it was the day the North Carolina  legislature  voted to bring Charlotte College into the UNC system. She served as an acting  Chancellor  of the university until 1966, when Dean Colvard was selected as permanent chancellor. Even though she had led the college since 1946, the State wanted a leader with experience of running a 4-year, public university. Cone and the university were profiled in the  July 16 ,  1965  issue of  TIME Magazine . In the article, she stated, ""we are not here to elevate ourselves but the institution"", when asked about the chancellor position. She served in various official positions until her retirement in 1973, at which time the main campus's student union was renamed the Cone University Center. Cone continued to work on behalf of the school in unofficial capacities until her death in March of 2003 . She is interred in the Van Landingham Gardens on the east side of the main campus, and a non-denominational meditation center is planned near the site. She is posthumously known as the founder of the school, a title which she rejected during her lifetime because she felt many people had a hand in creating and building the university. During her lifetime, she received 10  honorary degrees  from various colleges and universities and was inducted posthumously into the  Order of the Long Leaf Pine  in recognition to her contributions to North Carolina history. In 2004 the stretch of U.S. Highway 29 near the main campus was officially renamed the ""Dr. Bonnie Cone Memorial Highway.""     [ edit ]   Chancellors   Dean W. Colvard  (1913-2007) was appointed the first chancellor of the young university in 1966. A North Carolina native, Colvard had served as president of  Mississippi State University  (MSU). At MSU he was the first president to defy university policy of not playing against integrated teams when he ordered the men's basketball team to play  Loyola University Chicago  in 1963. At UNC Charlotte, Colvard took on the challenge of converting the school from a junior college to a 4-year member of the UNC system. He oversaw accreditation of the university, development of University Research Park (now one of the top 5 largest research parks in the country), constructed the first residence halls, created the first graduate programs, and grew the enrollment from about 1,700 to just over 8,000 students. He retired as chancellor in 1978, served as Chancellor  Emeritus  until his death. Colvard also received the Order of the Long Leaf Pine. The Colvard building, completed on the main campus in 1979, is named in his honor and houses the Department of Psychology.   E.K. Fretwell , the second chancellor of the university, was named in 1979. Fretwell came to the university from  University at Buffalo , where he was president. Under Fretwell, campus enrollment surged from 8,000 students to over 12,000. He oversaw the creation of the Graduate School, created more graduate degrees, integrated the library's card catalog into the  Internet  in 1983, created the ground work for a major business incubator, helped to develop the university's surrounding neighborhood, and increased academic grants to over $6.1 million dollars. Fretwell retired as chancellor in 1989. He served as interim president of the  University of Massachusetts  from 1991-1992, and in 1998, he served as the interim president of the  University of North Florida . In 1996 UNC Charlotte opened the Fretwell building, dedicated in honor of him and his wife Dorrie. The building headquarters the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. He and his wife live in Charlotte.   James H. Woodward  succeeded Fretwell in 1989. Woodward came to UNC Charlotte from the  University of Alabama at Birmingham  where he served as dean of engineering and senior vice president of academic affairs. Under Woodward, enrollment grew to over 19,000 students. Like his predecessors, he continued the growth of the Graduate School, and added various new doctoral programs. He also oversaw the largest fundraising campaign in the school's history and its largest building boom; as of the summer of 2005, no less than six buildings were actively under construction on the main campus. Woodward also oversaw creation of the CRI Campus. Woodward announced his retirement in 2004, and left the office of chancellor on  June 30 ,  2005 . Woodward Hall, the main campus's newest science and technology building, was dedicated in his honor on November 16, 2005. Woodward is currently serving as Chancellor Emeritus and teaches in the university's engineering department.          Chancellor Phillip Dubois       ' Phil Dubois'  is the fourth and current chancellor, assuming his current duties on July 15, 2005. He returns to Charlotte after serving as the president of the  University of Wyoming  from 1997 through 2005 . Previously, Dubois served as the  Provost  and professor of political science at UNC Charlotte from 1991 until 1997.   Dubois is the first chancellor, along with his wife and children, to occupy the brand new Chancellor's House (known as the Bissell House) on the UNC Charlotte campus that was completed in the winter of 2005. Phil is expected to oversee the process of the University becoming the fourth research-extensive university in the State.     [ edit ]   Alumni and faculty       Main article:  List of University of North Carolina at Charlotte people       Every graduate of UNC Charlotte automatically becomes a member of the Alumni Association, an organization of more than 80,000 former students whose primary purpose is to advance the interests of the university. There are no membership fees, annual dues or initiation rites, but there is an expectation that members will be active participants in the organization. In addition to promoting the interests of UNC Charlotte, the Alumni Association acts as a network of UNC Charlotte graduates who assist each other in their personal, professional and social development, and recognize and cheer the accomplishments of their fellow members. The association offers members a number of benefits and services. Some are in the form of information and communications, including a UNC Charlotte magazine and a quarterly electronic newsletter which keeps alumni up to date on news from the association and the university. The only requirement for membership is that alumni maintain contact with the Office of Alumni Affairs, provide an up-to-date address for alumni files and keep the association informed about their personal progress and career achievements.

At the time the school operated as a junior college, offering freshman-level courses to 250 students during the first school year, and was under control of the  New Hanover County  Board of Education. Wilmington College earned accreditation from the North Carolina College Conference in 1948 and became a member of the American Association of Junior Colleges. Further accreditation came in 1952 when the institution was so honored by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.   In 1958 Wilmington College was placed under the Community College Act of North Carolina, thereby passing control from the New Hanover County Board of Education to a board of trustees. The college was now state-supported and under the supervision of the North Carolina Board of Higher Education.   Wilmington College became a senior college on  July 1 ,  1963 , when the  North Carolina General Assembly  passed legislation allowing the school to offer a four-year curriculum and award bachelor's degrees. Six years later,  July 1 ,  1969 , the name of the school was changed to the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, making UNCW the fifth campus of the  University of North Carolina  system. On  August 22 ,  1977 , UNCW was authorized to offer its first graduate programs at the master's level. [3]  Currently, UNCW has over 11,000 students enrolled and nearly 500 full-time faculty members. The school offers seventy-three bachelor's degrees, thirty master's degrees, and two doctoral degrees. [4]     [ edit ]   Student Life     [ edit ]   Campus Life   The wide variety of programs in  liberal arts ,  biological sciences ,  fine arts , and the universitys esteemed film studies program draws a variety of undergraduate and graduate students from across the United States. The close proximity to  Wrightsville Beach  is witnessed as a primary draw for incoming freshman, though the allure dies down noticeably for upper classmen.   Teal  is the official school color of UNCW, with  white  and  gold  as alternate colors. The school color has become a point of pride for students, which is widely illustrated with spirit shirts bearing slogans such as Feel my Teal and exclusive teal-colored  Rainbow Sandals  being offered through the university bookstore.   In recent years, UNCW has progressed beyond its aging reputation as a party school, and improved academics at the university have given it the appeal as a rising star in the public university system of North Carolina. By 2008, the average  SAT  score for incoming freshman was 1156, with an average GPA of 3.74. [ 1 ]   UNCW has struggled to diversify its student body, with only 11% of enrolled students referred to as Minority. As such, the university has implemented a commitment to diversity as one of its strategic goals, and many on-campus events have been held in this pursuit. However, this issue is somewhat offset by UNCWs impressive enrollment of female students, which make up nearly 60% of the student body.   There is a leading superstition on campus that stepping on the school seal located outside Randall Library will prevent a student from graduating on time.     [ edit ]   Greek Life   Greek life at UNCW is prominent, but in no way dominant of social life on-campus. In 2007, to address the lack of official fraternity and sorority housing (allegedly due to an old Wilmington anti-brothel law) sororities and fraternities were moved into the University Suites and University Apartments respectively.   Phi Sigma Pi  functions as the universitys co-educational honors fraternity, but does not participate in UNCWs Pan-Hellenic council.     [ edit ]   Student Facilities   In 2000, the Student Recreation Center was opened to students, staff, and faculty members. It houses three basketball courts, a host of exercise machines, a weight training area, an indoor running track, and an indoor  climbing wall . It also includes a group exercise room which supports multiple clubs and activities, including  Yoga ,  Pilates , and an  Aikido  club.   Lumina Theater, named after the boardwalk theater that was once found on  Wrightsville Beach , offers a professional movie theater experience to the UNCW community. Opened in August of 2006, the Lumina Theater features 360 stadium seats, a 15.5' x 30' screen, Dolby Digital surround sound, 35mm capabilities and a digital projection system. Lumina screens blockbusters, independents, cult classics, art films, international films and student films throughout the academic year, four or more days a week, except during University holidays and breaks. Some notable Lumina events included a multi-part,  high-definition  screening of BBC's  Planet Earth  series over the span of several weekends, and a yearly 24-hour lock-in.     [ edit ]   Residential Accommodation   Galloway Hall  is the oldest dorm on the campus and has the typical arrangement of shared bathrooms for the entire hall. Galloway is typically considered to be a  freshman  dorm and has a social atmosphere. It underwent extensive renovations in 2006 and the elevators were renovated in 2008.   Graham-Hewlett  and  Belk  dormitories are configured in a suite-style arrangement with eight to ten individuals sharing a bathroom. Belk is the only dorm on campus which is exclusively female, as all other dorms are coed. Starting in 2008, Graham, Hewlett, and Belk Halls are arranged to hold additional students, with every other room housing three students (as opposed to the usual two). This has been done to accommodate the increasingly larger freshmen classes and prevent outsourcing housing to local hotels, as was done in the past when housing was overbooked.   Constructed in the 1980s,  Schwartz Hall  has shared bathrooms but is distinguished by its unusual square layout in contrast with the typical hall style dorms. Several of the floors on Schwartz are designated as ""study floors"" and require the residents to abide by stricter regulations.   The newer dormitories include  Honors ,  International , and  Cornerstone Hall  -- which are arranged with a courtyard between them to form what is referred to as "" Tri-house "". These dormitories were constructed in the late 1990s and early 2000s and are considered to be the most luxurious and well-maintained freshmen residences on campus.   In addition to the dormitories, UNCW also has on campus apartments and suites. There are 13 apartment buildings which can serve as home to 400 students. The Apartments house 4 students, who all have separate bedrooms but share a bathroom, living room, and kitchen. The apartments were extensively renovated in 2002 and now boast marble counter tops, tiled bathrooms, and new appliances.   The Suites, built in the late 1980s have two separate floor-plans which are divided by a breeze-way and set of stairs. There are 7 suite buildings which can also house 400 students. Each floor of the suites consists of a singles and doubles 'pod' The doubles pod consists of 6 bedrooms housing 12 students. The singles pod consists of 10 private bedrooms housing 10 students. All residents of the Suites share bathrooms, living rooms, and kitchens. As of 2008 the Suites have not been renovated. Starting with the 07-08 school year, the suites now house various sororities and the apartments house fraternities in addition to their previous function of housing the university's sports teams. The idea is for the suites and apartments to eventually become completely Greek.   The University has recently completed the construction of  Seahawk Village , a luxury apartment complex designed to compete with off-campus accommodations. Seahawk Village comprises six (6) apartment buildings and a club house with swimming pool. The complex is constructed in the Neo-Georgian architectural style that is consistent with campus. The Village includes a mix of 2,3, and 4 bedroom apartments with a total of (524) beds. The apartments are fully furnished and provided with wireless internet, cable TV, and local telephone service. They feature a full service kitchen and washer and dryer in each apartment.   In the Fall of 2006, as a part of UNCWs initiative to expand on-campus housing for 40% of undergraduate students, the  Seahawk Landing  residence facility was opened, featuring living arrangements similar to that found in the Seahawk Village facility, with expanded amenities such as a sandwich/coffee shop, convenience market, and small-scale recreation facility located on local site.   In 2008, construction began on the third phase of this residential expansion, which has been dubbed  Seahawk Crossing . Construction of these facilities, which includes the construction of a multi-level parking deck, involved leveling several acres of long-leaf pine forest, which promulgated a vociferous, but ultimately unheard student movement to block the destruction of what became known as the UNCW forest. As of December 2008, extensive progress has been made on the site, and the facilities are expected to be open by August of 2009.   All students who live on campus are subject to University rules and regulations and are required to have an on-campus meal plan. (With the exception of Seahawk Village residents.) All residences have an RA, or Resident Assistant, who is always a student, on each hall and are administered by an RC or Residential Coordinator who is a university staff member who lives on campus in the residence they are responsible for.   With the exception of the apartments, suites, and Seahawk Village apartments, all students are required to show identification to the DR, or Desk Attendant upon entering the various residential buildings.     [ edit ]   Off-Campus Housing   There are many apartments and condos that UNCW students live in. The Seahawk Perch which is maintained by the Dean of Students Office oversees off campus students.  More information about UNCW apartments can be found at  Seahawk Perch     [ edit ]   Campus Dining   UNCW has several options for campus dining. The primary venue for dining on campus is Wagoner Hall, which is affectionately referred to as the ""Wag"" by students. Wagoner Hall serves as a standard dining hall setup, with various stations offering a variety of foods, including a salad bar and assorted desserts. Wagoner Hall is also host to ""Wagsgiving"", an annual Thanksgiving feast arranged for students.   The newly renovated University Union now houses The Hawk's Nest where students can choose from: Jole Mole which serves Mexican cuisine, the Tuscan Oven which serves pizza and breadsticks, the Hawk Wok which serves Asian Cuisine including broth bowls and many other delicious dishes, the Varsity Grill which serves hamburgers and chicken sandwiches, there is a Sushi Station where you can custom make your sushi, Chick-fil-A and Quiznos. [ 2 ]   As is typical with most college campuses, UNCW's dining services are entirely controlled by  Aramark , whose contract demands the inclusion of meal plans in most, but not all, residential fees. The overwhelming majority of students find the quality of campus dining unremarkable, but maintain that it is still superior to most other UNC system schools' options.     [ edit ]   Academics     [ edit ]   Academic Profile     The university is organized in to five colleges:     College of Arts and Sciences   Cameron School of Business   School of Nursing   Watson School of Education   Graduate School     The university has 73 undergraduate degree programs, 30 masters degree programs, and two doctoral programs.     [ edit ]   Randall Library   William Madison Randall Library  supports the mission of the UNCW through the provision of information resources, services and programs relevant to the needs of its students, faculty and staff. It also serves as a rich cultural resource for the surrounding community and the region. To accomplish this mission, the library provides (1) diverse collections of informational resources in multiple formats; (2) efficient access to informational resources; (3) assistance and instruction in identifying, evaluating and interpreting information; (4) a safe and comfortable facility which stimulates intellectual curiosity and reflective thinking; and (5) programs that connect scholars and interested individuals with information and expertise to inspire lifelong learning such as the library workshop series.   Randall Library also boasts an extensive electronic reserves catalogue that is frequently utilized by faculty in reading assignments.     [ edit ]   2008 - 2009 Rankings   In 2008,  Forbes  ranked UNCW second among the public universities in North Carolina, behind only  UNC Chapel Hill [ 3 ] .   Kiplinger :     3rd ""Best Value"" for in-state students among public universities in North Carolina.   25th ""Best Value"" for in-state students among public universities in the United States.   35th ""Best Value"" for out-of-state students among public universities in the United States.     It is also important to note that among its peer institutions (public master's universities), UNC Wilmington ranks fourth nationally (behind James Madison, College of New Jersey, and Truman State). [ 4 ]   U.S. News & World Report :     Top 10 (currently 6th) public master's universities in the south for the past decade.     UNC Wilmington climbed to 6th among the top public master's universities in the South in 2008 (the university was ranked 7th in 2007). The university also saw a jump in their overall ranking among both public and private master's universities in the South, climbing from 20th to 14th. [ 5 ]   The most recent 26th edition (2004) of Barron's Profiles of American Colleges lists UNCW at the ""very competitive"" level, whereas the Carnegie Foundation classifies UNC Wilmington as ""more selective"". [ 6 ]  Only four UNC institutions are rated ""very competitive"": NC State, Appalachian State, UNC Asheville, and UNC Wilmington. UNC Chapel Hill is the only institution rated at the higher ""most competitive"" level.   Among UNC system institutions, UNCW has the 2nd-highest 4-year graduation rate (42.8), 3rd-highest 6-year graduation rate (65.1), and 4th-highest freshman-to-sophomore retention rate (83.1). [ 7 ]     [ edit ]   Athletics     The UNCW athletic teams for both men and women are known as the  Seahawks . They are a member of the  NCAA's  Division I and compete in the  Colonial Athletic Association . There are 19 varsity athletic teams for men and women. UNCW has the best student-athlete graduation for non-football playing Division I public universities in the state, with 74 percent.   The Men's Basketball team has won the CAA Championship in 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006.   In their first trip to the  NCAA Tournament , they lost to the 2nd seeded  Cincinnati  64 to 47.   In their second trip (2002), the 13th seeded Seahawks shocked the 4th seeded Trojans of  USC  with a 93-89  overtime  win. They were defeated by  Indiana  in the second round, 76-66.   The third trip (2003) had the Seahawks face off  Maryland . Aaron Coombs sank 2 free throws with 5 seconds left, giving the Seahawks a 72-73 lead and putting them in position to pull off a tourney surprise for the second year in a row. Instead, Maryland won the game 75-73 with the help of a nearly half court buzzer beater 3-point shot. Freshman John Goldsberry set an  NCAA Tournament  record by shooting 8 for 8 on 3-point shots.   In 2006 they earned a 9th seed, their highest ever seed, and faced off against the underrated #8 seed George Washington Colonials. GW was slotted to get a #4-#7 seed, so the Seahawks had a tougher 1st round opponent than most #9 seeds. Despite an excellent 1st half, the Seahawks blew a 18 point lead in the second half and lost in overtime 88-85.   In 06-07 they posted a dismal 7-22 record. Next year in th 07-08 season their record was 20-13 and missed post season play. It was T.J. Carter's last season for the Seahawks.   Men's Swim team has won the CAA title for 6 consecutive years, from 2002 through 2007.   Men's Track & Field team won their CAA record 9th team title in 2008.   UNCW's athletics facilities are regarded as some of the best in the southeastern part of the state. They include Brooks Field for baseball, the Trask Coliseum for basketball, the Seahawk Natatorium for swimming and Boseman Field (named after local state Senator  Julia Boseman ) for softball.

UNC Pembroke is a master's level degree-granting university and one of 16 schools that comprise the  University of North Carolina  system.

Croatan Normal School  was created by the General Assembly on  March 7 ,  1887  in response to a local petition, sponsored by  NC Representative  Hamilton McMillian of Robeson County.  [ 1 ] [ 2 ]  Fifteen students and one teacher composed the initial complement. With the goal of educating Native American teachers, enrollment was limited to the Native American Indians of  Robeson County .   In 1909, the school moved to its present location, about a mile east of the original site. The name was changed in 1911 to the  Indian Normal School of Robeson County , and again in 1913 to the  Cherokee Indian Normal School of Robeson County . In  1926  the school became a two-year post-secondary  normal school ; until then it had provided only primary and secondary instruction.  [ 3 ]   In 1939 it became a four-year institution, a change followed in 1941 by a new name:  Pembroke State College for Indians . The next year, the school began to offer bachelor's degrees in disciplines other than teaching. In 1945 the college was opened to members of all federally recognized tribes. A change of name to  Pembroke State College  in 1949 presaged the admission of white students, which was approved in 1953 up to forty percent of total enrollment; the  Brown v. Board of Education  decision of the following year eliminated all race restrictions.  [ 4 ]   In 1969 the college became  Pembroke State University , a regional university that was incorporated into the  University of North Carolina  system in 1972. The first master's degree program was implemented in 1978. On  July 1 ,  1996 , Pembroke State University became  The University of North Carolina at Pembroke.   In recent years, the university's profile and attention has increased recently as the result of an aggressive statewide advertising campaign, in which  billboards , radio, and television advertisements have touted UNCP as a place ""where learning gets personal,"" due to small class sizes, among other factors.  [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Campus          The water feature at UNCP. Belk Hall and North Hall, which are both women's residence halls, are in the background.       The University's campus is situated just north of Pembroke, located directly behind N.C. Highway 711.  U.S. Highway 74  is located just minutes from campus, as is  Interstate 95 . The center of campus is considered to be the Chavis University Center (often referred to as the University Center, or the UC). Students can  bowl , play  pool  and related games, or just hang out in the lounge.  [ 6 ]  The dining hall, as well as Bert's Cafe, which houses the newly opened Wild Wings cafe and wingery, as well as SubConnection, are located in the UC.  [ 7 ]   The UC lawn, an open grass area in front of the UC, is where students play amateur sports, read on benches, or use the area for  free speech . Faculty Row, a thoroughfare for university traffic, essentially divides the campus into east and west sections. The eastern side of campus includes the Livermore Library, Oxendine Science Building, Old Main, and Wellons Hall, among other buildings. The campus on the west side has the Business Administration Building, Education Center, and most of the residence hall communities. Lumbee Hall, the Dial Humanities building, the Sampson building, Auxiliary building, and the Jones Athletic Center make up most of the north end of campus.  [ 8 ]   New to campus is Oak Hall, a residence hall, as well as the UC Annex, opened in September 2007. Many additions and renovations have taken place on campus beginning in 2000, when an education bond was passed. Construction is set to continue on campus past 2007.  [ 9 ]   The Givens Performing Arts Center hosts numerous Broadway shows, orchestras, shows geared towards children, and also hosts the ""Distinguished Speaker Series,"" in cooperation with the Association of Campus Entertainment, which has brought in notable people such as  Nancy Grace ,  Pat Buchanan ,  Nikki Giovanni , and  Mo Rocca , among many others.  [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Organization   The title of Principal or Superintendent was used prior to 1940. After 1940, when UNC Pembroke became a collegiate-level institution, the title of President was used. Upon becoming a member institution of the  University of North Carolina  system, the title was changed to Chancellor.     [ edit ]   Presidents     Dr. O.H. Browne (1940-1942)   Dr. Ralph D.

[ 11 ]  In addition, classes are taught exclusively by  professors . There are no classes on campus taught by graduate assistants. This is where the University's motto ""Where learning gets personal"" comes from.  [ 12 ]  In 2008, the school had an enrollment of 6,303 students; of these, 5,577 students were undergraduate, and 726 were graduate students. The school also has 249 full-time faculty.  [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Ratings   In the  U.S. News and World Report  ""America's Best Colleges and Universities 2008,"" UNCP finished 1st among North Carolina public universities for the percentage of classes under 20 students. UNCP also finished 1st among North Carolina's public universities for the percentage of international students enrolled in the university. For ethnic diversity, UNCP finished first in the South and in North Carolina for universities and tied for sixth among national universities. UNCP also finished fourth in terms of affordability.  [ 14 ]  UNCP was also named on  The Princeton Review  ""2008 Best Colleges: Region by Region"" in the Southeastern region for the third consecutive year.
