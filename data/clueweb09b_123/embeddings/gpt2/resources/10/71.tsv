Somewhere on a desert highway She rides a Harley-Davidson Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind She's been runnin' half her life The chrome and steel she rides Collidin' with the very air she breathes The air she breathes.  You know it ain't easy You got to hold on She was an unknown legend in her time Now she's dressin' two kids Lookin' for a magic kiss She gets the far-away look in her eyes.

What color are they now?  Do you think that you believe in yours  More than they do theirs somehow?  When you see the flags of freedom flyin'    Today's the day our younger son  Is goin' off to war  Fightin' in the age old battle  We've sometimes won before  Flags that line old main street  Are blowin' in the wind  These must be the flags of freedom flyin'                 Tema:  Flags Of Freedom       Artista:  Neil Young      Album:  Living with war - In the beginning      Todas las Canciones del CD      Año: 2007      Discografia de:  Neil Young.       Sitio oficial:   Neil Young    Enviada por:    ballnavgroup    Hits:   153   Top 1.000 canciones mas vistas     Ultimos discos insertados        Zona de Descarga de : Neil Young       -   Letras de Canciones Neil Young - Flags Of Freedom      ---------------------------------------    Despues de no poder ofrecer las letras de canciones en esta web ,te damos las mejores opciones    Neil Young - Lyrics   Neil Young - Letras canciones    Letras de Canciones    Buscador de Neil Young - Flags Of Freedom           -   Escuchar el CD: Neil Young - Living with war - In the beginning     No todos los albums se pueden escuchar , se estan incluyendo    -  Top Canciones de Neil Young.    -  Videos de Neil Young    -  Caratulas Cd Neil Young - Living with war - In the beginning      -  Fotos e imagenes de Neil Young      - Descarga:   Neil Young - Flags Of Freedom.mp3        -  Noticias de :  Neil Young          - Movil:   Flags Of Freedom.mid  en tu movil         Zona  Comprar CD Neil Young    -  Compra en Espa Neil Young         -  Compra en America Neil Young    Zona  Conciertos    - El canto del loco   - Hombres G - Juanes - Amaral - Mikel Erentxun - Santa Justa Klan  - Y mas artistas....      Zona  Radios    -   40 Principales     -  M 80  -  Cadena dial  -  Maxima FM   -  Letras de canciones                          A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J    K    L    M    N    /a>   O    P    Q    R    S    T    U    V    W    X    Y     Z  |  Buscar Letra:      Artista/Autor   Allbum/CD   Cancion    Parte de la Letra            Descargate  el Tono Polifónico o Melodía de Neil Youngpara tu móvil                                    Top 100 canciones mas vistas          Letra de Cancion:  Neil Young - Flags Of Freedom incluida en su disco  Living with war - In the beginning.          Volver a > www.portaldeletras.com   letras Neil Young - Flags Of Freedom        "
