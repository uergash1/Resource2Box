GX267-86-1128545	"SVG Topofinder II uses SVG both to display data and to provide the graphical user interface (GUI) for mapping functions. SVG, or Scalable Vector Graphics, is an XML standard for displaying visual information. It is similar to HTML, but like PostScript, is a much more powerful way of doing screen layout. Designers and developers have much more control and flexibility with SVG.  http://nris.state.mt.us/topofinder2 Zoom in You can either click anywhere on the map or click and drag to draw a rectangle in any direction. Release the mouse button to zoom in.  Toggling between topos and photos Use the radio buttons on the right side of the map to toggle between topo maps (DRGs) or aerial photos (DOQs). Sometimes you can't see images when the DOQ option is selected. Either you are not zoomed in far enough or there is no coverage for that area. There is a checkbox for adding township and range (PLSS) to the map when DOQs are selected.  SVG is also scriptable (using Javascript), which allows us to create tools and behaviors similar to those found in traditional desktop applications. Because there are SVG viewer plug-ins for web browsers, such as Internet Explorer, we are able to deliver this functionality through a familiar and widely used application. Topofinder II requires Adobe's SVG Viewer plug-in. You can find out more by visiting http://nris.state.mt.us/svg/gettingstarted.htm  Zoom out Select the zoom out button and click on the map to zoom out.  Query Pan Select the pan button. Click and drag on the map in any direction to pan to a new location You can select one or more feature types and get a list of all the places in the state of those types.  Clicking the button will pop up a window with a menu of various ways to locate places or areas on the map. Named Features  Clicking on an item in the list will display it on the map.  Full Extent Clicking on this allows you to return to the full extent for Montana. You out will the can also type in a name withselecting a feature type. This bring up a list of all places in state.  Selection Rectangle This works much like the zoom in tool. Clicking and dragging with it will highlight quads on the map and will pop up a window with a list of quads for downloading.  Selecting both a feature type and entering a name will narrow your search considerably.  Map Name Search (24K) Locate a quad by name. Click on a letter to find quads beginning with that letter. Select from the pulldown menu and click ""Locate"" to display the quad on the map.  Navigation palette Click on the navigation button to bring up the navigation palette. You can drag the palette around on the screen to reposition it. Click on the ""X"" to close the palette. You can use the navigation palette to move to another part of the map, either by dragging the red box or using the arrow buttons. (Shiftclicking a button will move 9X farther). Lat/Lon Search (Decimal) Enter the decimal coordinates for a location. Hit ""Locate"" and it will be displayed on the map.  Location Move mouse over map to get coordinates in State Plane (NAD 83) and Latitude/Longitude  Measure Click on the map to start measuring. You can continue clicking around the map to find a total distance between several points. To start over, Alt-Click.  Scale bar Click on the scale bar button to bring up the scale bar. You can drag the palette around on the screen to reposition it. Click on the ""X"" to close the palette."

The State Library also offers metatag training (email FindOR trainer  Jey   Wann . GroupWise users: jey.a.wenn@state.or.us).  A word on dates:  Be careful with the content format of the date related   tags. Dates are expressed as YYYY/MM/DD.   Examples:   <meta name=""createDate"" content=""2001/11/01"">  <meta name=""dateofLastModification"" content=""2003/05/10"">    Note:   Unless you have the dates in YYYY/MM/DD format, a user using the correct date   format to search for a file in FindOR won't find your document.     Back to top   Optimizing graphics for the Web   When creating images for the Web, keep file size in mind. Large graphic files   take a long time for users with the minimum 28-baud modems to download. Waiting   too long for pages to load can make users frustrated with the site before they've   had a chance to really explore it.   To avoid this, produce illustrations and photos with the minimum   resolution, size and color depth necessary. You can do this manually, but programs   like  ImageReady  (bundled with  Photoshop)  can be used to automate   the process of minimizing your graphic file sizes.   Web page file size limit   Try to keep your Web page no larger than 64K, including all graphics. This   way, viewers with older modems can see your pages and get to your information   without waiting around too long for pages to load. 64K may seem like an impracticably   small size, but there are workarounds if you have pages that really need lots   of graphics.   For example, if you have large detailed graphic such as maps, rather than   slowing down the loading of your entire page, you could show tiny snapshot   of the maps with a link to see each one in a larger size on a separate page.   This way, the user has a choice whether or not to click for a more detailed   view, and will probably be willing to wait if it's exactly the information   he or she needs.   Another way to make a graphic load faster is to specify the height and width   in the HTML code (example:  <img   src=""art/masthead.gif"" height=""38"" width=""193"" border=""0"" alt=""Currents   Online""> ). By specifying the height and width of the graphic,   the page will load with the proper amount of space ""reserved"" for   each graphic prior to displaying the graphic. This makes for a faster load   and also keeps the page layout from sizing and resizing itself in an annoying   fashion as the viewer waits for it to display.     Back to top   Graphics file formats     There are two choices of Web graphics file formats in popular use,   *.jpg (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and *.gif (Graphics Interchange Format).   There   will hopefully   be more formats to use in the future (like the much-anticipated  Portable   Network Graphics  [PNG] format and  Scalable   Vector Graphics  [SVG] format).   Things to remember about both file formats:  Either file format   works for image maps (graphics with clickable areas). Note: There is an excellent  NCSA   tutorial  for making image maps.   Both formats compress your image and lose data that can't be recovered.   To avoid problems with this limitation, keep your master graphic in *.PSD   format (if you've used Photoshop with multiple layers) or in *.TIF format   (if the graphic is all on one layer). This way you always have a full-resolution   master to go back to when you need to make corrections or revisions.     Back to top   GIF file format   You should use the GIF format for most of your Web graphics. Use the GIF format   for:       Simple illustrations, logos, diagrams and charts     Graphic elements, like arrows and bars     Images that need a transparent background (called the GIF89a format. In  Photoshop,  you will need the GIF89a plug-in to create these)     Animated images (called the GIF89 format)       Things to remember about GIFs:  A GIF file contains only 256   colors (also called ""8-bit"" or ""indexed"" color). You really   have only 216 colors (also called ""Web safe"" or ""browser safe"" colors)   if you are building for both Mac and PC browsers with old 8-bit video cards   (see  ""browser friendly"" palette ).   However, since such cards have been obsolete for 5 years now, it is not as   important as it once was to stick to this palette.   The GIF file format also allows one of the 256 colors to be transparent in   what's called the GIF89a format. A transparent channel allows you to create   Web graphics that can be used on a colored background on a Web page. Note:   To create these graphics, make the background layer in  Photoshop  approximately   the same color as your Web background, so when you make the background transparent,   the image will be anti-aliased to the right color. (We've all seen graphics   with fuzzy halos on Web pages, and that's because the graphic artist who   created them didn't realize this, or else the HTML coder changed the background   color on the Web site without asking for a new graphic anti-aliased to the   new color.)   Images with lots of tiny detail (like the DHS logo) may need to be saved at   300 dpi or greater, but try to restrict most of your GIF images to 72 dpi to   save on file size. After all, most monitors only display at approximately that   resolution, so your viewer won't be missing much.    Tip:  Use   the ""interlace"" option when saving GIFs in  Photoshop.  That   way the image will begin building on the Web page and slowly evolve, instead   of showing a ""loading graphic"" symbol until the image is downloaded.     Back to top   JPEG file format   Use the JPEG file format for:       Photos, either black-and-white or color     Images for the Web that have lots of detail     Images that don't work well as GIFs, like images with many colors or gradiants     Things to remember about JPGs:  JPEGs, named after the committee   that invented it, was designed for compressing full-color or gray-scale images,   mainly photographic. Unlike GIFs, which are limited to 256 colors, JPEGs can   contain millions of colors. Because you can select from 12 degrees of compression,   you can moderate the file size and control degree of detail you are willing   to lose. Try to restrict JPG images to 72 dpi; in most cases, it will be sufficient.   Note you can't make transparent JPGs; if you need a transparent graphic,   you will have to make it a GIF. ( More   about JPEGS .)     Back to top   PNG: Web graphic file format of the future   PNG stands for ""Portable Network Graphic."" PNG is a file format   for raster images, like GIF and JPG, but the compression is ""lossless"" instead   of ""lossy""; in other words, no data is lost when the graphic is saved   as a PNG. It also can contain much more than 256 colors (8-bit indexed color),   unlike GIF. It supports thousands of grays (16-bit grayscale) and millions   of colors (24- and 36-bit truecolor).   PNG came about around a number of years ago when it looked like CompuServe   was going to charge for the use of its proprietary GIF format. Programmers   got   busy with   an alternative format for GIFs, and improved it both in compression capabilities   and number of colors. PNG was approved by the  WWW   Consortium  in 1996, but hasn't had widespread graphics application   support or browser support yet (for example, Netscape 7.0 and lower don't   support it).    PNG can also substitute nicely for TIF format as well. It handles indexed-color,   grayscale, and truecolor images equally well, and allows transparent images.   It doesn't offer animated images or photos yet, so it isn't ready   to replace animated GIFs or JPGs completely.   PNG has competition, however, Seeing how unpopular it's decision to charge   royalties for the GIF format was with users, CompuServe retracted its move   in that direction. Instead, it started developing a new compressed graphics   format, called GIF24. GIF24 was supposed to be a public domain format that   can support 24-bit images (unlike the current 8-bit limit on GIFs). As of this   writing, however, it looks like CompuServe is going to support the PNG file   format instead (source:  WWW   Consortium PNG Web site ).    SVG stands for ""Scalable Vector Graphic."" SVG is an XML-based graphics   language from  W3C specifications .   SVGs are vector images that scale well in a variety of displays, from desktop   monitors to PDAs to wireless phones.    SVG is text-based, so it is accessible to screen readers. It was developed   collaboratively ( Adobe  [which   has a  downloadable   SVG viewer ] and  Sun ,   among others).

We recommend browsing with either:      Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0 or 6.0     Netscape 4.0 or 7.0     Of course, using versions of either of these browsers such as Netscape Communicator 4.79 and Internet Explorer 4.0 will also work. These browsers are all free downloads. We've designed our pages to take advantage of browser features such as Javascript. Both Microsoft and Netscape browsers support Javascript, but sometimes in slightly different ways. We also make sure that our pages can be viewed by older browsers.   If you're not using Netscape or Internet Explorer, you will also get a good view of nces.ed.gov by using a browser that supports tables, forms, and images.            Appearance   -   Resolution      NCES makes every effort possible to develop for our audience's varying graphics resolutions. While we currently develop most of our pages for 800 x 600 resolution, we try to develop for both 640 x 480 and up to 1280 x 1024 resolution.  By using this as our guideline, we can be sure that everyone can enjoy horizontal-free scrolling when viewing our pages. Of course our pages can be best viewed in 1280 x 1024 resolution.  As mentioned, although we try to accommodate all screen resolutions some of our data tables are just too large to fit on one screen in a 640 x 480 screen resolution. When this occurs we recommend changing your screen resolution to 800 x 600 or higher. This is easily done on your computer (PC's) by going to your ""control panel"" and selecting ""display"". Within display select ""settings"" and choose the screen resolution you would like.           Appearance   -   Start-up Page     Make  nces.ed.gov  your browser's start-up page to get the latest in education statistics.

Accessibility and PDF's      Adobe Systems, Inc. is producing various products designed to make PDF documents accessible to persons using screen reading software.  Their  accessibility webpages  describe their efforts.  They also have a free downloadable accessibility plug-in called,  MakeAccessible . This plug-in runs under Microsoft Windows 95 OSR 2.0, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows NT 4.0 with SP 5 or SP 6, or Windows 2000. Each system should have at least 64 MB (128 MB recommended) of RAM per processor, 200 MB of virtual memory, and 870 K of disk space available.   The MakeAccessible Plug-in creates a tagged Adobe PDF file from an untagged PDF file. This allows a pdf document to be read by a screen reader for greater accessibility.      Other Acrobat Add-ons      Once you've downloaded and installed the Acrobat Reader, you'll be able to view PDF files simply by clicking on the link to the PDF file in your browser. Either the browser will handle the PDF file, or it will bring up another program for viewing the PDF file. Either way, a special window will appear that contains buttons that work only for PDF files. Use these buttons to navigate through the file.    If you want to print the PDF file, you must use the print button located within the Adobe Acrobat  viewer (usually this is just above the document on the left side).  Use of the browser print button or the browser's ""File, Print"" command will not result in a correct printout.   The NCES website supports  byteserving . Byteserving, also known as page-at-a-time or byte-range downloading, enables you to view a PDF file from a Web server before the entire file is downloaded.   Note:  Byteserving is not supported by the older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader, so you may need to install a newer version.     Once you get byteserving working, if you'd like the full document to be downloaded in the background even as you browse through it, select the ""Allow Background Download of Entire File"" option in the General Preferences of the Acrobat Reader.                  Video/Audio Playback and Flash      About Video and Audio Playback                NCES has adopted Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) as its standard for video deployment. Videos will be able to be viewed immediately using Windows Media Player, or can be downloaded for easier viewing. The downloaded version will always be better quality than the streamed or viewable copy; this is due to performance reasons. The Windows Media Player should automatically download any needed codecs (these are needed to view certain video formats).        How to obtain Windows Media Player      Click  here  to acquire Windows Media Player.      About Macromedia Flash                NCES uses Macromedia Flash in some of our applications, most notably in the  NCES Student's Classroom . Macromedia Flash Player displays web application front-ends, high-impact website user interfaces, interactive online advertising, and short-form to long-form animation. Designers and developers use Macromedia Flash MX to develop distinctive and compelling content, revolutionary user interfaces, and rich applications for the web. It is pre-installed in most web browsers and on most computers. It is included in Windows 98 (including all new Windows 98 and Windows XP computers), Netscape Navigator, Apple Macintosh operating systems, America Online, and WebTV, among others.

SVG is a web development language based on XML. SVG, a W3C recommendation (web standard), enables web developers and designers to create dynamically generated, high-quality graphics from real-time data with precise structural and visual control. Through the use of SVG, we are able to offer dynamically generated, high-quality, scalable, interactive graphics from real-time data. Although many SVG viewers are available, NCES recommends the Adobe SVG Viewer 3.0 (or above) as a stable, well-supported viewer.       How to obtain Adobe's SVG Viewer      Visit  Adobe SVG Viewer Download Area   to download a free viewer.              ZIP Format Archive Files      Why we use ZIP                A Zip format allows either extremely large files, or files created in formats no longer widely used, to be combined and compressed and thus downloaded with more speed and ease.  The user requires an ""unzip"" utility to extract files from an archive (all files for downloading have been compressed using zip archiving and compression). NCES uses Zip archiving for several of its newer applications, such as video, and for many data sets. In addition, some older reports are available only in a combination of file formats, such as Lotus .WK1 format for tables and plain ASCII for the text.   The time it takes to download a file depends on two factors: the size of the file and your connection speed. To estimate the time required to download a file we have provided a link to a  ""File Download Time Calculator.""

GX022-94-15754170	[ previous chapter ]   [ table of contents ]   [ next chapter ]     1. Overview    Chapter 1 Index       Architecture     Project Viewers     System Requirements    1.1 Architecture    The following diagram shows up the Synoptic Display architecture:         The system consists of four parts: (1) project builder, (2)  project viewer, (3) repository of components and projects, and (4) runtime project  engine. First two parts reside on user's PC, last ones  on the  server side.   Project Builder   is a console application which is  used to create and modify synoptic display projects. Actually,  this is a special graphical editor, that allows to define a logical flow of  data: data sources (such as  Accelerator Device ), data consumers (for example,  visual components for the dynamic data presentation), data handlers (for  examples, integrators and comparators), and data pipes. The second function  of the builder is definition of static visual components, such as immutable  lines, geometrical shapes and tests. Builder is connected to the server side  repositories in order to download the library of components, as well as to save and  load projects. Besides, projects may be stored in local files.   Project Viewer  is  a client side application, that renders graphical data received from the runtime project  engine. In most cases, this is a web browser. See details  below .   Repository of Components and Projects  is a  server side application, to keep and distribute synoptic display projects among project  builders instances and runtime project engine. It also keeps a common library of  elementary components for the builders.   Runtime Project Engine  is a server side machine, that  handles user's requests, downloads appropriate projects from the  repository, launches data acquisition jobs and generates graphical  data.   We would like to emphasize some important points related to the proposed  architecture:     An open, portable and human readable data    format is used to convey and store projects, components and    graphical data;      A central server side repository is used to store    common component library and projects, that allows to share data among    multiple developers;      Projects, stored in the server repository,    immediately become available for execution;          In most cases, a standard web browser may be  used as a project viewer, and very simple software installation is required.      1.2 Project Viewers   Project viewer is used to show data on user's PC. In most cases, this is the  only part of the Synoptic Display, that must be installed and configured on the  client machine. There are three options:      The recommended option is to use a standard Internet browser with  Scalable Vector Graphics  (SVG) support.  SVG allows to see dynamically changed images without visible blinking. SVG plug-ins for  browsers are provided by Adobe Systems, Inc. and they may be downloaded for  free from their   site .    Unfortunately, plug-ins are not available for all types of browsers and all  operating systems. Recommended configurations are   highlighted :    SVG Availability                     Microsoft Internet Explorer       Netscape 4       Netscape 6       Mozilla           Windows       available for: Windows 98XP   MS IE 4.0+       available for: Windows 98XP Netscape 4.54.78       N/A       N/A           UNIX       N/A       N/A       available        available           Mac       available for Mac 8.69.1, Mac 10.1   MS IE 5.0+       available for: Mac 8.69.1, Mac 10.1   Netscape 4.54.78       N/A       N/A          SVG plug-in  is available, but Synoptic Display does not work in this configuration;    Looks like an unofficial release, may be downloaded from the   archive of old versions .      If you are not able or do not want to use an  SVG viewer, it is possible to see results as JPEG or GIF image on any graphical  web browser without additional software. The disadvantage is a visible refreshing of  image every several seconds with blinking.    In the future, a special console SVG viewer will be developed to see dynamic  images on every platform without web browser.        1.3 System Requirements   Particular system requirements depend on which modules will be used.     In every case, a connection to   http://www-bd.fnal.gov/synoptic  is  required.   To see graphical data from the executed projects, you  will need a graphical web browser with SVG support. See table   above . Adobe  SVG plug-ins have their own limitations and requirements.   To use Project Builder, you should install on you computer:       Java Development Kit  (JDK) ver. 1.4.0 or higher.     Java Web Start  (JWS)  a system for remote software download and  installation. In some cases, JWS is installed automatically together with JDK.

GX000-45-8379972	"NOAA OR&R Home  /  Chemical Aids  /  CAMEO Intro  / MARPLOT        MARPLOT     MARPLOT is a general-purpose mapping application, jointly developed by NOAA and EPA, that runs on both Macintosh computers and in Windows. It is designed to be easy to use and fast, and to consume as little disk and memory space as possible, so that you can create, view, and modify maps quickly and easily. It also allows you to link objects on your computer maps to data in other programs, including CAMEO.     Maps and Map Data     Map data for MARPLOT comes from a variety of sources. All of the TIGER/Line data from the Bureau of the Census (roads, water bodies, railroads, parks, and so on) is available in MARPLOT format and can be  downloaded for free . Maps are also available on the  LandView IV DVD , which also contains EPA-regulated sites, demographic data, geographic boundaries (states, counties, cities, congressional districts, and so on), Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) Features and selected Federal Lands from the USGS National Atlas.     Other source data, in a number of formats, can be translated easily into MARPLOT files. The MARPLOT files themselves are compact and platform-independent.     How MARPLOT Works     Seven types of objects make up the content of MARPLOT maps, and are arranged within map layers. The seven kinds of MARPLOT objects include points (symbols), rectangles, circles, polygons, polylines, text labels, and pictures. You can create, examine, and modify each type of object. For example, you might use a point object to mark the location of a building or monitoring site, and polylines to represent things like roads and streams. You can use polygons to represent things like parks or water bodies. Using picture objects, you can take any bitmap or PICT image and display it at fixed geographical coordinates on a map.     Maps and layers are the groups into which objects are organized. Maps, which usually cover specific geographic areas, are subdivided into layers (layers usually span multiple maps). Any particular layer usually contains one type of object, such as roads, water bodies, or hospitals.         Searching for map objects by geographical criteria is easy and fast in MARPLOT. You can ask questions ranging in complexity from ""What objects are at this point?"" to ""How many objects on one of these three layers are within 1.5 miles of this threat zone?""         Inter-application communication allows MARPLOT to share information with databases and other programs that contain information about map objects. You can query a database for certain records, then show the selected records on the map. From the map, you also can select certain objects, and then get information from the database for those objects.     Examples of database programs that communicate with MARPLOT are CAMEO and LandView. MARPLOT can be used along with  CAMEO  to plot the locations of facilities, hospitals, and other sites of interest to planners and responders, and to examine the geographical extent of real or potential emergencies.  LandView , developed by EPA, NOAA, USGS, and the US Bureau of the Census, is a collection of data for EPA-regulated sites and demographic and economic information from the 1990 census, combined with a program for exploring the database and for displaying data in MARPLOT according to your queries.

New ACNET components to work with digital Status/Control was added in the beginning of August 2002.  New web page is created 07/17/02.         Synoptic Display is a Java application for flexible online graphical  representation of data received from a data acquisition system. We consider this  project as a next generation of programs such as ACNET Lexigraphics and EPICS  MEDM.   Synoptic Display projects (an equivalent of MEDM screens) are rendered on  major Web browsers (for monitoring purposes) or started in a web-startable  console Java application (both for monitoring and control). Small bandwidth (as  low as 1001000 byte/sec) is required between client and server sides due to  usage of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for data transfer.    Synoptic Display components (data sources, processing pipes, visualization  widgets) can be graphically arranged and logically interconnected in a  web-startable Project Builder; projects can be saved on a server-side repository  or in local files. XML is used as a project format. A Runtime Project Engine  (RPE) on the server side handles user's requests, downloads projects from the  repository, launches data acquisition jobs, and generates SVG pictures. Servlets  and JSPs (Java Server Pages) are used as RPE web-tier. At present time ACNET  Java Data Acquisition Engine is a primary data source for the Synoptic Display,  since this is corporate Fermilab standard; there are no limitations to create  new types of data sources.    The field of Synoptic Display's application primarily covers monitoring of  various data and presentation of current state of plants and equipments with  sketchy diagrams. Due to security reasons, Synoptic Display does not support  device settings at this time.   Synoptic Display has been developed at Fermilab, which is a U.S.  Department Of Energy National Laboratory. The project is deployed on the  computer network, owned by a U.S. government agency.  Please read the   official information  about copyrights and policy.

Or worse, finding one message morph into more even when you're not using your web browser?   Calling unsolicited Internet pop-up advertisements the next generation of spam, Attorney General Lockyer cautions that persistent pop-up ads could signal that your home computer is open to hackers who can install new programs and view, change or delete data without your permission.     One pop-up advertising campaign recently prompted a federal court to issue a temporary restraining order against the company that allegedly had been sending pop-up ads as frequently as every 10 minutes to urge viewers to buy software costing $25 to $30 to block future pop-up ads. The  Federal Trade Commission complaint  was filed in the U.S. District Court in Maryland.   Here are some tips to consider from the FTC for curbing these unwanted pop-up ads and better protecting your home computer from hackers.                DISABLE WINDOWS MESSENGER SERVICE IN MICROSOFT XP/2000    Pop-up spammers are exploiting a feature of the Microsoft Windows operating systems known as Messenger Service.  Despite the name, Windows Messenger Service doesn't have anything to do with instant messaging.    Messenger Service is designed to provide users on a local- or wide-area computer network with messages from the network administrator. For example, a company's network administrator might send a message to all its users that the company's network will be shutting down in five minutes.  If your home computer is connected only to the Internet, you may not have any practical uses for Windows Messenger Service.    Consumer should note that disabling the Windows Messenger Service may not be practical for computers connected to a home or business network. In such instances, your network should be protected by a firewall.    Steps for disabling Windows Messenger Service:    Click  Start    Click  Control Panel  (or point to  Settings , and then click  Control Panel )    Double click  Administrative Tools    Double click  Services    Double click  Messenger    In the  Startup  type list, click  Disabled    Click  Stop    Click  OK      INSTALL A FIREWALL   Another way to cut off pop-up spam is to run a firewall, software or hardware designed to block hackers from accessing your computer and getting into your programs and files.   Firewalls provide the benefit of preventing not just pop-up ads, but any unauthorized access.  Some new operating systems, including Windows XP, have built-in firewalls, but they may not be activated.  Consumers can find out how to set up built-in firewalls by consulting their online ""Help"" feature. You can check out several free firewall software programs via the Internet or purchase commercial products. In any case, a firewall needs to be updated regularly to stay effective.   A firewall is different from anti virus protection. Anti virus software scans incoming communications and files for troublesome files. A firewall helps make you invisible on the Internet and blocks all communications from unauthorized sources.  A firewall is especially important if you have high-speed Internet access through a cable modem or a DSL (digital subscriber line) connection.      Consumers can file a complaint about a deceptive pop-up advertisement by using the  Attorney General's online complaint form  or by writing the Attorney General's Public Inquiry Unit at P.O. Box 944255, Sacramento, CA 94244-2550.  Consumers also may file complaints and get more information from the  Federal Trade Commission .  Be sure your complaint includes the name of the company or Web site advertised in the pop-up spam.

Agents           Also known as intelligent software agents or just agents, this area of AI research deals with simple applications of small programs that aid the user in his/her work. They can be mobile (able to stop their execution on one machine and resume it on another) or static (live in one machine). They are usually specific to the task (and therefore fairly simple) and meant to help the user much as an assistant would. The most popular (ie. widely known) use of this type of application to date are the web robots that many of the indexing engines (eg. webcrawler) use.              Agent     FTP site:   www.cpan.org/modules/by-category/23_Miscellaneous_Modules/Agent/       The Agent is a prototype for an Information Agent system. It is both platform and language independent, as it stores contained information in simple packed strings. It can be packed and shipped across any network with any format, as it freezes itself in its current state.        agentTool     Web site:   en.afit.af.mil/ai/agentool.htm   Download site:   en.afit.af.mil/ai/_vti_bin/shtml.dll/registration.htm     Another Java based agent development framework. Fairly unique in that it emphasizes the use of a GUI for designing the system which will ""semi-automatically synthesize multiagent systems to meet those requirements"". You need a java enabled browser to download. :P        Aglets Workbench     Web site:   www.trl.ibm.com/aglets/index_e.htm       An aglet is a Java object that can move from one host on the Internet to another.  That is, an aglet that executes on one host can suddenly halt execution, dispatch to a remote host, and resume execution there. When the aglet moves, it takes along its program code as well as its state (data). A built-in security mechanism makes it safe for a computer to host untrusted aglets. The Java Aglet API (J-AAPI) is a proposed public standard for interfacing aglets and their environment. J-AAPI contains methods for initializing an aglet, message handling, and dispatching, retracting, deactivating/activating, cloning, and disposing of the aglet. J-AAPI is simple, flexible, and stable. Application developers can write platform-independent aglets and expect them to run on any host that supports J-AAPI.        A.L.I.C.E.     Web site:   www.alicebot.org     The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism. Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one wild-card ('*') match character per pattern. AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors. Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.          Ara     Web site:   wwwagss.informatik.uni-kl.de/Projekte/Ara/index_e.html       Ara is a platform for the portable and secure execution of mobile agents in heterogeneous networks. Mobile agents in this sense are programs with the ability to change their host machine during execution while preserving their internal state. This enables them to handle interactions locally which otherwise had to be performed remotely. Ara's specific aim in comparison to similar platforms is to provide full mobile agent functionality while retaining as much as possible of established programming models and languages.        BattleBots     Web site:   www.bluefire.nu/battlebots/     AI programming game where you design the bot by selecting hardware and programming its CPU, then competing with other bots. Competitions can have teams and special rules for a game.   The hardware for use in your bot includes weapons, engine, scanners, CPU, etc. The programming lauguage is dependent on the CPU type and is similar to an assembly language.         Bee-gent     Web site:   www2.toshiba.co.jp/beegent/index.htm     Bee-gent is a new type of development framework in that it is a 100% pure agent system. As opposed to other systems which make only some use of agents, Bee-gent completely ""Agentifies"" the communication that takes place between software applications. The applications become agents, and all messages are carried by agents. Thus, Bee-gent allows developers to build flexible open distributed systems that make optimal use of existing applications.        Bond     Web site:   bond.cs.ucf.edu     Yet another java agent system...  Bond is a Java based distributed object system and agent framework. It implements a message based middleware and associated services like directory, persistence, monitoring and security. Bond allows to easily build multi agent, distributed applications. Another application of Bond will be a Virtual Laboratory supporting data annotation and metacomputing.         Cadaver     Web site:   www.erikyyy.de/cadaver/     Cadaver is a simulated world of cyborgs and nature in realtime.  The battlefield consists of forests, grain, water, grass, carcass (of course) and lots of other things. The game server manages the game and the rules.  You start a server and connect some clients.  The clients communicate with the server using a very primitive protocol.  They can order cyborgs to harvest grain, attack enemies or cut forest.  The game is not intended to be played by humans!  There is too much to control. Only for die-hards: Just telnet to the server and you can enter commands by hand.  Instead the idea is that you write artificial   intelligence clients to beat the other artificial intelligences.  You can choose a language (and operating system) of your choice to do that task.  It is enough to write a program that communicates on standard input and standard output channels.  Then you can use programs like ""socket"" to connect your clients to the server.  It is NOT needed to write TCP/IP code, although i did so :) The battle shall not be boring, and so there is the so called spyboss client that displays the action graphically on screen.        Cougaar     Web site:   www.cougaar.org/     Cougaar is java-based architecture for the construction of large-scale distributed agent-based applications.  It is the product of a multi-year DARPA research project into large scale agent systems and includes not only the core architecture but also a variety of demonstration, visualization and management components to simplify the development of complex, distributed applications. [Yet another java based agent system -- ed.]        D'Agent (was AGENT TCL)     Web site:   agent.cs.dartmouth.edu/software/agent2.0/   FTP site:   ftp.cs.dartmouth.edu/pub/agents/       A transportable agent is a program that can migrate from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network.  The program chooses when and where to migrate.  It can suspend its execution at an arbitrary point, transport to another machine and resume execution on the new machine. For example, an agent carrying a mail message migrates first to a router and then to the recipient's mailbox.  The agent can perform arbitrarily complex processing at each machine in order to ensure that the message reaches the intended recipient.        Dunce     Web site:   www.boswa.com/boswabits/       Dunce is a simple chatterbot (conversational AI) and a language for programming such chatterbots. It uses a basic regex pattern matching and a semi-neural rule/response firing mechanism (with excitement/decay cycles).  Dunce is listed about halfway down the page.        FIPA-OS     Web site:   fipa-os.sourceforge.net   Secondary Web site:   www.nortelnetworks.com/products/announcements/fipa/     FIPA-OS is an open source implementation of the mandatory elements contained within the FIPA specification for agent interoperability. In addition to supporting the FIPA interoperability concepts, FIPA-OS also provides a component based architecture to enable the development of domain specific agents which can utilise the services of the FIPA Platform agents. It is implemented in Java.        FishMarket     Web site:   www.iiia.csic.es/Projects/fishmarket/     FM - The FishMarket project conducted at the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA-CSIC) attempts to contribute in that direction by developing FM, an agent-mediated electronic auction house which has been evolved into a test-bed for electronic auction markets. The framework, conceived and implemented as an extension of FM96.5 (a Java-based version of the Fishmarket auction house), allows to define trading scenarios based on fish market auctions (Dutch auctions). FM provides the framework wherein agent designers can perform controlled experimentation in such a way that a multitude of experimental market scenarios--that we regard as tournament scenarios due to the competitive nature of the domain-- of varying degrees of realism and complexity can be specified, activated, and recorded; and trading (buyer and seller) heterogeneous (human and software) agents compared, tuned and evaluated.        GNU Robots     Web site:   www.gnu.org/software/robots/robots.html     GNU Robots is a game/diversion where you construct a program for a little robot, then watch him explore a world. The world is filled with baddies that can hurt you, objects that you can bump into, and food that you can eat. The goal of the game is to collect as many prizes as possible before are killed by a baddie or you run out of energy. Robots can be written in Guile scheme or using a GUI.        Grasshopper     Web site:   www.grasshopper.de/     Another Java agent system. Full featured and actively developed. Commercial, but free. Historically targeted at embedded systems.          Hive     Web site:   hive.sourceforge.net     Hive is a Java software platform for creating distributed applications.

At its heart, Hive is an environment for distributed agents to live, communicating and moving to fulfill applications. We are trying to make the Internet alive.        ICM     Web site:   www.nar.fujitsulabs.com/   SourceForge site:   sourceforge.net/projects/networkagent/     The Inter-Agent Communication Model (ICM) is a communication mechanism that can be used for sending messages between agents in an asynchronous fashion. Its intended application area is as a transportation mechanism for agent communication languages (ACLs), such as KQML and FIPA's ACL.          Jacomma     Web site:   jacomma.sourceforge.net   SourceForge site:   sourceforge.net/projects/jacomma/     Jacomma is an agent development platform/framework for developing distributed, mobile, and reactive information agents with heterogeneous communication capabilities, in Java and JPython.  Jacomma provides a development framework and an execution environment, which sits on top of the Inter-Agent Communication Model infrastructure. The ICM defines a communication protocol, a store and forward messaging architecture, and low level communication infrastructure for message exchange.  Communication is truly asynchronous, based on TCP sockets.  ICM has an entry in this howto, or you can find it via a link off the site.          Jade     Web site:   sharon.cselt.it/projects/jade/     JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework) is a software framework fully implemented in Java language. It simplifies the implementation of multi-agent systems through a middle-ware that claims to comply with the FIPA specifications and through a set of tools that supports the debugging and deployment phase. The agent platform can be distributed across machines (which not even need to share the same OS) and the configuration can be controlled via a remote GUI. The configuration can be even changed at run-time by moving agents from one machine to another one, as and when required.        JAM Agent     Web site:   members.home.net/marcush/IRS/     JAM supports both top-down, goal-based reasoning and bottom-up data-driven reasoning. JAM selects goals and plans based on maximal priority if metalevel reasoning is not used, or user-developed metalevel reasoning plans if they exist. JAM's conceptualization of goals and goal achievement is more classically defined (UMPRS is more behavioral performance-based than truly goal-based) and makes the distinction between plans to achieve goals and plans that simply encode behaviors. Goal-types implemented include achievement (attain a specified world state), maintenance (re-attain a specified world state), and performance. Execution of multiple simultaneous goals are supported, with suspension and resumption capabilities for each goal (i.e., intention) thread. JAM plans have explicit precondition and runtime attributes that restrict their applicability, a postcondition attribute, and a plan attributes section for specifying  plan/domain-specific plan features. Available plan constructs include: sequencing, iteration, subgoaling, atomic (i.e., non-interruptable) plan segments, n-branch deterministic and non-deterministic conditional execution, parallel execution of multiple plan segments, goal-based or world state-based synchronization, an explicit failure-handling section, and Java primitive function definition through building it into JAM as well as the invocation of predefined (i.e., legacy) class members via Java's reflection capabilities without having to build it into JAM.          JATLite     Web site:   java.stanford.edu/       JATLite is providing a set of java packages which makes easy to build multi-agent systems using Java. JATLite provides only light-weight, small set of packages so that the developers can handle all the packages with little efforts. For flexibility JATLite provides four different layers from abstract to Router implementation. A user can access any layer we are providing. Each layer has a different set of assumptions. The user can choose an appropriate layer according to the assumptions on the layer and user's application. The introduction page contains JATLite features and the set of assumptions for each layer.          JATLiteBeans     Web site:   waitaki.otago.ac.nz/JATLiteBean/         Improved, easier-to-use interface to JATLite features including KQML message parsing, receiving, and sending.                Extensible architecture for message handling and agent ""thread of control"" management                 Useful functions for parsing of simple KQML message content                JATLiteBean supports automatic advertising of agent capabilities to facilitator agents             Automatic, optional, handling of the ""forward"" performative            Generic configuration file parser            KQML syntax checker                      Java(tm) Agent Template     Web site:   www-cdr.stanford.edu/ABE/JavaAgent.html       The JAT provides a fully functional template, written entirely in the Java language, for constructing software agents which communicate peer-to-peer with a community of other agents distributed over the Internet. Although portions of the code which define each agent are portable, JAT agents are not migratory but rather have a static existence on a single host. This behavior is in contrast to many other ""agent"" technologies. (However, using the Java RMI, JAT agents could dynamically migrate to a foreign host via an agent resident on that host).  Currently, all agent messages use KQML as a top-level protocol or message wrapper. The JAT includes functionality for dynamically exchanging ""Resources"", which can include Java classes (e.g. new languages and interpreters, remote services, etc.), data files and information inlined into the KQML messages.        Khepera Simulator     Web site:   diwww.epfl.ch/lami/team/michel/khep-sim/     Khepera Simulator is a public domain software package written by  Olivier MICHEL  during the preparation of his Ph.D. thesis, at the Laboratoire I3S, URA 1376 of CNRS and University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis, France.

Mole     Web site:   mole.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/       Mole is an agent system supporting mobile agents programmed in Java.  Mole's agents consist of a cluster of objects, which have no references to the outside, and as a whole work on tasks given by the user or another agent. They have the ability to roam a network of ""locations"" autonomously. These ""locations"" are an abstraction of real, existing nodes in the underlying network. They can use location-specific resources by communicating with dedicated agents representing these services. Agents are able to use services provided by other agents and to provide services as well.        Narval     Web site:   www.logilab.org     Narval is the acronym of ""Network Assistant Reasoning with a Validating Agent Language"". It is a personal network assistant based on artificial intelligence and agent technologies. It executes recipes (sequences of actions) to perform tasks. It is easy to specify a new action using XML and to implement it using Python.  Recipes can be built and debugged using a graphical interface.         NeL     Web site:   www.nevrax.org     NeL is actually a game development library (for massive multi-player games), but I'm including it here as it (will) include a fairly  sizable AI library. Here's a blurb from the whitepaper:  The purpose of the AI library is to provide a pragmatic approach to creating a distributed agents platform. Its focus is agents; individual entities that communicate regardless of location, using an action-reaction model.         OAA     Web site:   www.ai.sri.com/~oaa/     The Open Agent Architecture is a framework in which a community of software agents running on distributed machines can work together on tasks assigned by human or non-human participants in the community. Distributed cooperation and high-level communication are two ideas central to the foundation of the OAA.  It defines an interagent communication language and supports multiple platforms and programming languages.
