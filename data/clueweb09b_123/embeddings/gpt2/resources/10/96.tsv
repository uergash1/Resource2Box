For five months in 1925, the 40-square-mile Smackover field was the focal point of one of the wildest mineral booms in North America. Today, south Arkansas's oil fields produce petroleum throughout a 10-county area.   Columbia and Union counties also stretch over one of the largest brine reserves in the world. Bromine is derived from brine, or saltwater, and local companies play an international role in the commercialization of bromine and its many applications   The Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources in Smackover, featuring state-of-the-art indoor exhibits as well as working equipment on display outside in its adjacent Oil Field Park and shares the fascinating stories of this region’s natural resources, with emphasis on petroleum and brine recovered for bromine extraction.   The museum features a 25,000-square-foot main exhibition/research building that includes a 10,500-square-feet exhibit hall, orientation theater, exhibit work area, research center and museum store/gift shop.   Explore the museum and walk the streets of a 1920s Arkansas boom town or travel back 200 million years ago to discover the origins of oil. Take a chance drilling and see if you will become an oil tycoon or go flat broke. Learn how 95 percent of the products we use daily are made of or with two of Arkansas's natural resources.   Tour the Oil Field Park adjacent to the main building. Walk along its paved trail past full-sized operating examples of vintage derricks and equipment used from the 1920s to the modern era. See a re-creation of a 1920s standard rig and a 112-foot wooden derrick.   The museum staff offer a wide variety of year-round educational and interpretive programs. Choose from guided tours of the museum and the Oil Field Park, films, lectures, field trips, special demonstrations, and programs.   The museum's research center includes a special collection of library, archival, and photographic materials that emphasize the history of this region. Computerized data of Arkansas’s petroleum and brine development are available to researchers and members of the oil and brine industries.   Custom-fit educational programs are also available for students of all ages. The museum's education center is located behind the main building. The museum's two shaded picnic areas are within walking distance.   Admission to the museum is free.   The Arkansas Museum of Natural Resources is on Ark. 7 two miles south of Smackover.

Only 90 minutes from New York City and less than 2 hours from Philadelphia, the four counties spanned by the Poconos include Carbon, Monroe, Pike and Wayne.  Each have their own special appeal, making the Poconos ideal for a family vacation, reunion, meeting, convention, honeymoon, couple getaway, or bus, car or RV trip.    History       The Pocono Mountains have been a perennial favorite for resort visitors since the early 1800, when Philadelphia Quakers started the resorts of Buck Hill Falls and Pocono Manor. By 1900, the high altitudes brought thousands of visitors from the growing cities of Philadelphia and New York for summer vacations.     The year-round appeal of the Pocono Mountains was boosted by the opening of Pennsylvania first commercial ski area, Big Boulder, in 1946. The popularity of family-owned and operated resorts with all the comforts of home soared in the 1950, and the Poconos provided the ideal summer vacation including picnics, zany games, group sports and outdoor activities.     In 1963, the first heart-shaped tub was introduced at Caesar Cove Haven in Lakeville, PA. Life Magazine photos of this novelty generated a flood of publicity, and the Poconos became famous as the oneymoon Capital of the World.In the 1980, the growth of whitewater rafting, golfing, outlet shopping and other attractions further broadened the appeal of the Pocono Mountains as a vacation destination. Today the area boasts year-round attractions, from natural wonders, cultural events, and historic museums to relaxing spas, romantic retreats and active adventures for all ages.       Attractions       Opened in 2003, the Mountain Laurel Center for the Performing Arts in Bushkill offers performances ranging from symphony orchestras and piano concerts to country legends and rock nroll shows, in a center dedicated to the arts, education and the environment.        Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, PA opened its 2mile super speedway for Indy racing in 1971, and NASCAR soon followed in 1972, bringing over 100,000 race fans to the area twice every summer.        Golfers can play over 35 courses here, including courses designed by Robert Trent Jones, AJ Tillinghast and Donald Ross.      Stressed out professionals, leading increasingly hectic lives, want to be pampered during their vacations, so the resorts of the Pocono Mountains began adding on-site spas.      Outdoor Wonders       The Poconos are a mecca for outdoor adventure enthusiasts for hiking, biking, fishing, canoeing and whitewater rafting, with 7 state parks offering snowmobile trails, snowshoeing, and eagle watching. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River, and Steamtown National Historic Site are not to be missed offering a wide variety of activities for the entire family. The mountains are home to 150 lakes, 18 waterfalls, 170 river miles and Lake Wallenpaupack, a 5,600 acre lake with 52 miles of shoreline. Hunters can pursue white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, ruffed grouse, and other area wildlife. In the southern Poconos, the northern end of the Appalachian Trail is a major flyway on the autumn raptor migration route, home of the nationally renowned Hawk Mountain sanctuary.        Recently, the Pocono Mountains celebrated the opening of the northeast largest indoor waterpark with 90,000 square feet of water slides, a lazy river, an interactive treehouse waterfort, a wave pool and much more.  Check out Great Wolf Waterpark for all the fun details     Ski areas in the Poconos are not particularly large and do not have large vertical drops (Sno Mountain and Elk Mountain, with 1000' vertical drops, are the largest), so runs tend to be on the shorter side. However, the Poconos do offer conveniently located skiing, and many areas also offer night skiing. Many Pocono ski resorts cater to both winter and summer, transforming themselves into waterparks for summer visitors.     Do You Believe in Magic?
