These studies apply new measurements to the benefits of public services in the United States, particularly public transit services. The approach a work in progress, so these are truly working papers, offered in the hope of encouraging more research along these same lines. In recent years the American policy process at all levels of government has become increasingly sophisticated in transportation issues. This is the result of the increasingly evident clashes that transportation problems and policy options generate in our communities. These political and budgetary ""clashes"" are also transactions in which measurable benefits are exchanged for tax revenues. The theory of public choice applied to transit here and in a recent book1 offers a disciplined approach for cataloging the transactions that shape transportation services. Through research such as this, public sector budgets for transit can be illuminated not only for professionals and citizens, but for the decision-makers themselves. It is our hope that local decision-makers will look into our research and see familiar patterns that routinely arise in the budgetary process for transit. They might see for the first time a means by which to weigh quantitatively the competing goals that the process sets for transit services. Public transit is widely supported throughout the United States. Intuitively, policy-makers and citizens recognize or at least suspect that transit generates large benefits. The measurement of these benefits, however, has eluded even the most dedicated students of the subject. In political environments increasingly hungry for benefit measurements with which to compare costs, even the strongest public support falls short. These working papers offer suggestions by which the public's support for transit can be translated into the budgetary process through the influence of benefit measurement that is not only credible and rigorous, but has intuitive appeal as well. As most people suspect, the diversion of motorists onto rapid transit does indeed improve the flow of congested highways. The benefit is demonstrable and its real dollar value is measurable. Similarly, as most people suspect, cities with intensive transit services achieve economies that make their citizens richer--and this effect is measured in these chapters. The magnitudes of benefits uniformly exceed transit costs, whether those costs are paid through fares or taxes.  1  Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, by David Lewis and Fred Laurence Williams, (Aldershot: Ashgate, 1999).  vii   Acknowledgements This research was conducted by the firm HLB Decision Economics (HLB) under agreements with the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Highway Administration.

Except for project planning forecasts, the value of transit's ongoing impact on policy goals pertaining to traffic congestion, affordable mobility, and location efficiency has seldom been measured. A recent book, Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, (1999) reported on extensive new Federally-sponsored research to measure transit benefits in a public choice analytical framework. This departure from the traditional planning framework yielded remarkable new empirical findings on the worth of transit benefits to passengers and taxpayers alike. The present report compiles subsequent FTA research in the same vein. FTA refined its method for calculating transit impacts on auto corridor and network travel times, and this method permits economic valuation. Also, a technique is introduced to facilitate periodical calculations based on changes in corridor traffic volumes. The calculation of transit's location efficiency benefits is extended from residential to commercial properties. We will report on hedonic analysis of commercial property and also the calculation of region-wide agglomeration economies. The Public Choice Transit Benefit Matrix provides the policy-oriented analytical framework for this effort. It is displayed with illustrative measurements in Exec. Table i below. Exec. Table i Public Choice Transit Benefit Matrix Public Choice Transaction Category Transit Policy Function Affordable Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Management Market Low Fare Save Auto Cost Bypass Traffic Club Social Budget Density Econ. Less Traffic Spillover Labor Market Less VMT Road Budget  The estimated net national benefits of transit for 1995 are presented in Exec. Table ii, indicating that benefits exceed costs and, perhaps more importantly, the net benefit depends on the market niche or policy functions in behalf of which transit services are deployed. Transit's costs, that is, vary according to service profiles that vary with the function transit is performing. Since relatively ""flat"" fares prevail across the transit functions, the resulting subsidies vary according to policy function as well. Moreover, the economic value of trips to passengers also varies by policy function, so that the value of user benefits from a basic mobility trip may be twice that of a congestion bypass trip. However, without a calculation of transit benefits to local, State and Federal taxpayers, the net benefit reported in Exec. Table ii would be misleading. Subsequent chapters report measures for these non-passenger benefits, including travel time benefits to ix   motorists, location benefits for commercial property, and regional efficiency and productivity economies.

Standardized Measurement of Strategic Transit Corridor Performance The Federal Transit Administration conducted door-to-door travel time measures, comparing the travel modes. On the basis of these measures, FTA modeled transit's impact on the other modes in the corridor. The models so derived enable researchers to calculate transit's impacts over time relative to changing travel volumes in the corridor. This procedure equips local planners to calculate transit's highway network benefits for the purposes of periodic transportation planning and budgeting. The network effect of rapid transit in the Washington, D.C. I-270 corridor is illustrated in Exec. Fig. i, where the shaded area represents the time-volume curve if commuters did not have the Washington Metro Red Line as an option to the freeway network. This shaded area translates into person hours the value of which can be calculated from accepted estimates of the value of time. Travel Time Without Transit 150 100 50 0 0 Exec.

Table iii displays summary data on network travel time savings for six transit corridors FTA surveyed in 1998 and 1999. The reader will note that the network benefits x   of transit in Exec. Table iii are arrayed across the same public choice transaction categories used for transit's policy functions earlier. Indeed, taxpayers' stakes in transportation networks parallel their stakes in any public choice budgetary process. The daily travel time savings for transit passengers and motorists in these corridors amounted to over 60,000 hours, worth over $225 million annually. The order of magnitude in these results certainly justify the effort to take similar measurements wherever transit is suspected of influencing highway travel demand. The six corridors summed up in Exec. Table iii represent only the most recently constructed transit systems--only two have rapid rail systems. Further measurements for the major transit corridors in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco could prove illuminating. Moreover, this approach might foster periodic updates of transit's local network effects. Exec.

Even though congestion objective of urban transit investment today, there are no indicators effect on the performance of urban highways. traffic volumes and today do not track the management is a key that monitor transit `s  This analysis develops a method by which to extend the Texas Transportation Institute's annual congestion index so as to quantify, on a regular basis, the impact of transit on congestion in urban areas. The paper uses FTA's inter-modal equilibrium model and tracking process to generate an algorithm that, when integrated with the TTI index, permits the index to be expressed both with and without the influence of transit. A test of the method was conducted in two corridors served by urban rail systems. Summarized in Exec. Table iv, the results indicate that the 1999 TTI index for the I-270 corridor in Washington D.C., of 1.72, would have been 1.98 if WMATA's MetroRail had not been in operation. This means that whereas free-flow conditions were exceeded in the corridor by 72 percent during peak periods, free-flow conditions would have been exceeded by 98 percent had MetroRail not been operating. This signifies, as Exec. Table iv reports, that one branch of the MetroRail Red Line saved four million person-hours of delay in 1999. This saving was worth an estimated $62 million in fuel, time and other highway user costs in that year--all at a cost to taxpayers of $25 million. Results are also reported for the Butterfield light rail corridor in Sacramento, California.  xi   Exec.

The 1996 report introduced a methodology to determine the economically justifiable level of subsidy for public transit in the United States. Economically efficient subsidies arise in the absence of congestion pricing on the nation's roadways. The quantitative significance of an efficient subsidy hinges on the extent to which transit reduces the congestion externality. This in turn depends on the cross-price elasticity of demand between transit and auto, the magnitude of the social marginal cost of roadway congestion and a range of other elasticity and cost factors. A total operating subsidy approaching $19.4 billion annually (in constant 1997 dollars) is justified, despite very low reported cross-price elasticities between transit and auto travel. For many congested urban areas, in the absence of road pricing, current transit fares are too high to fully exploit transit's ability to help optimize the economic contribution of highway and transit systems. The changes in the second-best subsidy estimates in Exec. Table v are driven by four principal variables: (i) the change in the demand for auto, bus and rail travel between 1993 and 1997, (ii) the change in traffic conditions on freeways, expressways and principal arterial streets, (iii) the change in operating expenses per passenger mile and (iv) the effect of general inflation. 2  Texas Transportation Institute, 1999  xii   Exec.

Econometric Analysis of Transit and Agglomeration Here we explore the relationship between transit presence, agglomeration economies and the economic efficiency of cities. Agglomeration economies refer to the decline in production costs due to the concentration of economic activity in a specified geographic area. In this context, the presence of a well-functioning transit system is thought to strengthen the impact of agglomeration economies, and thereby, to help cities function even better. This concept helps explain, in particular, why firms and industries located in urban areas tend to be more efficient than firms and industries located in rural areas. By extension, this concept also helps explain why larger cities tend to operate more efficiently than smaller ones. This is the hypothesis that the present analysis proposes to investigate. But, how can transit stimulate urban efficiency? In congested areas, mass transit is often the fastest and most reliable way for people to move from one point to another. As such, transit facilitates meetings and other face-toface communications between members of different firms and industries. In other words, transit promotes the exchange of information, ideas and concepts between firms and industries located within large metropolitan areas. By reducing transportation costs and congestion, mass transit also lowers search costs for would-be employees and recruitment costs for employers. It facilitates the transfer of workers across firms and industries and promotes the efficiency of urban labor markets. Improved public services in general, and mass transit, in particular, also attract more workers to a city. This increase in the number of workers will, through the realization of economies of massed reserves (""economies from selecting workers from a larger pool"") benefit the firms located in a city. Finally, because transit reduces congestion costs, it facilitates the concentration of economic  3  As defined in the 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration  xiii   activity. Other things equal, transit enables a higher degree of agglomeration which in turn results in higher productivity and stimulate economic growth. The methodological framework proposed by HLB allows testing for the existence and the magnitude of the postulated impact of transit presence on agglomeration economies and the economic dynamism of cities. To perform the analysis, a sample of one hundred U.S. metropolitan areas has been selected. These metropolitan areas represent about 68% of the U.S. population and produce 73% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product.4 They are spread over different geographic regions in the U.S. The analysis conducted by HLB consists of estimating the coefficients of a multivariable relationship between urban efficiency on one-hand and city characteristics, including a measure of transit presence, on the other hand. The analysis has led to the conclusion that part of the productivity of large cities is indeed attributable to the presence of mass transit. In other words, it indicated that cities with more transit tend to be more efficient than cities with less transit. This finding has been validated by various statistical tests. The findings of this analysis are summarized in Exec. Table vi. As the table indicates, the estimated impact of transit presence is relatively small. The impact, however, has been validated through various advanced testing procedures. All the tests have led to the conclusion that, indeed transit does help stimulate the economic efficiency and growth of urban areas in the United States. As mentioned above, the technique used by HLB also allows quantifying the extent to which transit presence contributes to urban efficiency. The data indicate, in particular, that a 10 percent increase in transit presence, which represents about 50 extra vehicles (or about 620 extra employees in the transit sector) would raise labor productivity by about 0.4 percent annually. This increase in labor productivity would, for an average metropolitan area5 (which, in 1996, had about 1.7 million habitants and produced about $55.9 billion worth of goods and services), create about $195 million worth of value added per year, which is about $192 per worker6. Furthermore, a simple model of economic growth brought support to the hypothesis that transit promotes economic growth. The analysis indicates that a 10 percent increase in transit presence would raise economic growth by about 0.2 percent. For an average metropolitan area, this would represent about $36 million worth of goods and services created annually, which is about $36 per worker.  4 5 6  Based on 1996 data The universe is about 276 metropolitan areas  The national aggregate effect can be estimated by multiplying the value added per worker with the number of workers, about 127 million worker.  xiv   Exec.

This report provides (1) a detailed review of the existing literature on the topic, (2) a sound methodological framework that can been used to actually measure the impact of transit on commercial properties and (3) an estimate of this impact for a specific area. A careful examination of the literature leads to the conclusion that the hedonic pricing methodology is one of the--if not the--most appropriate methodology for this type of study. A hedonic price model expresses the value of a commodity as a function of its characteristics or attributes. This approach can be applied to the estimation of the impact of transit on commercial property values by regressing a measure of property value on a set of attributes, including the distance to traffic. The estimated coefficient on this variable can be used to derive an estimate for the benefits of transit. The empirical part of this study uses data on 2,830 commercial properties located in Washington D.C. The key findings for the Washington D.C. area include: The distance to the closest Metro Station always enters the model with a negative sign indicating that, other things being equal, the shorter the distance between a commercial property and a Metro Station, the higher the value of the property. This impact is found significant in most of the regressions.  xv   Most of our coefficient estimates are reasonable and confirm the findings of the existing literature. In particular, our measure of the distance to the CBD enters the model with a negative - and significant - coefficient. In our sample, the proximity of a Bus stop does not seem to enhance the value of commercial properties. In some cases, the distance to the closest bus stop even enters the model with a coefficient significantly greater than zero. This counterintuitive result can partly be explained by the way the distance is measured in this particular case study. Exec. Table vii summarizes the key empirical findings of this study. On average, a 1,000 feet reduction in the distance to a Metro station raises the value of commercial properties by $2.3 per square foot. Given an average property size of 30,630 square feet, a 1,000 feet reduction in the distance to transit increases the average value of a commercial property by $70,139 or approximately 2%. Since this estimate is based on a sample of commercial properties observed at a given point in time (a cross-section analysis), it should not be affected by the business cycle. Exec. Table vii Property Value Impacts of Transit Value Increase Per Square-Foot 1 Foot Decrease 1,000 Feet Decrease $0.002 $2.290 Average Value Increase $70.1 $70,138.5  HLB has determined that there are about 11,000 commercial properties in Washington D.C. Therefore, if the average distance to a Metro station were to fall by 100 feet other things equal, the commercial properties located in Washington D.C. would enjoy a total premium of approximately $71 Million.  xvi   Chapter 1. A Brief Review of Historical Transit Policy Analysis The Specter of Transit Costs Historically, policy analysts have examined the performance of transit investments and expenditures in the framework depicted in Figure 1.1. Efficiency is measured as service units per unit of cost or inputs. Effectiveness is measured as the number of ""sales"" per service unit. Costeffectiveness is measured as costs per ""sale"". This straightforward scheme has served to organize the analysis of transit's internal performance. It is a framework that accepts as given the goals (""sales"" or ""patronage"") established by or attributed to policymakers and restricts itself to the economic performance of transit in reaching these legitimate goals.  Efficiency e.g., Cost Per Vehicle Hour  Effectiveness e.g., Passenger Miles Per Vehicle Hour  Cost-Effectiveness e.g., Cost per Passenger Mile Figure 1.1 Framework for Transit Performance Analysis During the 1970s and early 1980s, when large Federal financial aid to transit agencies was growing, this ""performance framework"" was used repeatedly to analyze the merits of transit expenditures at the national aggregate level. Consistently, the studies found that the influx of new funds resulted in lower efficiency and effectiveness. Generally, fare reductions and service expansions were significant. But, just as significant was ""leakage"" of resources into higher labor costs, reduced productivity, and decreased ""sales"" per service unit. These findings were reported regularly in Federal reports, in professional publications, and in the news media. Indeed, the idea that government transit subsidies created as much leakage as passenger benefits became the conventional wisdom throughout the transit industry. As stated by Douglass Lee: The growth in transit operating costs during the 1970s greatly exceeded the rate of inflation, and the reasons for this growth seem to be more closely related to government subsidies than to other facts either external or internal to the industry. (1983) In creating the analytical framework sketched in Figure 1.1, transportation professionals ""operationalized"" the goals they perceived to be coming from transit policymakers. Specifically, the professionals translated economic and social goals into objects that could be measured on the transportation network. Obviously, they reasoned, benefits resided in the passengers of the transit system, and the dollar value of transportation policy goals could be 1   captured in the mileage or time-savings afforded to transit passengers. A 1983 report illustrates this point of view: Most of the goals stated as rationales for federal operating subsidies depend upon increasing transit ridership while reducing auto travel, but because the subsidies had a minor effect on ridership they had even less effect on these indirect goals. (1983) Numerous policy analyses of transit and transit subsidies were conducted in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were commissioned in response to a widely held perception that transit costs were out of control. Two basic methods were used, both relying on patronage as the ultimate measure of transit performance. One method was known then as an ""accounting approach."" A unit of output or outcome, such as patronage, or average transit labor costs, was measured before and after an increase in revenues. Changes in the ""after"" measures were intepreted as being ""where the money went."" If, in the second measurement, fares were lower and patronage higher, these were considered transportation improvements. Higher labor costs or lower output per person-hour were considered ""leakage"" of the new monies. One accepted version of the accounting framework is presented in Figure 1.2. The circled point in the diagram is the aggregate average fare and ridership for bus and rail transit in the U.S. in 1980. The next horizontal line up is the ""before"" fare, with no federal operating subsidies and only modest local subsidies. Above that is the efficient or base cost per trip, and the highest line gives the actual average cost per trip. Applying an elasticity of -.3 yields the intersection of the demand curve with the higher fare. The following explanation was offered for Figure 1.2:  [Area ""A""] represents the payments to factors of production that were above what was ""needed"" to produce the service, either because the factors were overpaid or because they were underutilized. [Area ""B""] is the subsidy to ""old"" passengers at the efficient cost and the old fare level, while Area D is the additional subsidy to old passengers stemming from reduced fares. Area E is the incremental consumer surplus from ""new"" or induced riders, and Area C + E is the subsidy to induced riders at the efficient cost. Areas F and G indicate the fares paid by the two groups.        An examination of Figure 1.2 reveals no account for changes in service costs associated with service improvements. Rather, the diagram rests on the assumption that the average unit of transit service in 1980 has the same composition of factors of production as in 1970. This assumption rests on a premise that in the absence of Federal and other subsidy increments during the 1970 transit service levels and patronage would have stayed constant. If this accounting method were classified as an experimental design, it would be classed as the ""one-group pretest-posttest design"" wherein one measurement is followed by a second measurement after a period of time. The period of time is selected because it includes the intervention of an explanatory variable, in this case the advent of Federal operating subsidies. Campbell and Stanley (1963) consider this design barely worth doing since it leaves numerous rival hypotheses uncontrolled. In the instance, in Figure 1.2, the introduction of subsidies was only one among a number of events that plausibly could explain large changes in transit's cost  2   structure. Two successive national energy crises, near bankruptcy and bail-out of New York City, sharp inflationary pressures, and major transit service redeployments all affected transit costs during the 1970s. In addition, Figure 1.2 glosses over obvious ongoing historical trends affecting transit patronage and costs, trends well underway before 1970.

Figure 1.2  Partition of Transit Expenditures for Accounting Framework  historical increasing trends in auto ownership and decentralization undermined transit and would naturally undermine the implicit null hypothesis that transit costs and patronage would have stayed the same in the absence of the financial events of the 1970s. In actual fact, as demonstrated in Figure 1.3, during the 1970s transit service and patronage first plunged and then climbed back, thanks in part to the incremental subsidies. To achieve this recovery, the transit industry re-deployed transit services, resulting in a marked shift in the composition and therefore the cost per unit of service. Most importantly, services were redeployed for commuters from the suburbs. Transit patronage in costly peak-period services between suburban residential areas and central cities increased by over 50 percent in the 1970s. Transit planning and marketing employment increased, and maintenance costs increased with the increase in higher quality air-conditioned vehicles. Therefore, rather than signifying ""overpaid""  3   or ""underutilized"" factors, some part of area ""A"" in Figure 1.2 represents improved transit services, a measurable change in the transit's ""production function."" Figure 1.3 plots the 1970-1980 trend line addressed in Figure 1.2--based on two data points-against the annualized trend in transit patronage. Transit's patronage trend, based on average change from 1960 to 1974 is extrapolated to 1985. Figure 1.2's discussion of patronage (and by implication, service) is confined to the area designated as ""A"" in Figure 1.3, premised on the notion that patronage would have remained essentially constant in lieu of subsidies. In fact, the trend was sharply downward, requiring serious change to reverse the actual trend.

Figure 1.3  Historical Transit Patronage and the Two Observation Model  ""B"" in Figure 1.3 reflects the costly transformation from an industry in long term decline to one of growth and, after 1982, stability. The costs of this transformation surely included some ""leakage"" into higher compensation and lower productivity. But the lion's share of the transformation costs were devoted to improvements in equipment and services as measured by longer trips in higher quality services, discussed more fully below. There simply is no category in Figure 1.2 to count these service improvements, so their costs are dismissed as ""overpaid"" or ""underutilized"" factors of production. The story suggested in Figure 1.3 is more subtle than one of misplaced largesse. Rather, it is a story of transformation in which transit efficiency and service qualities improved, winning the financial support of local constituents and restoring equilibrium in transit patronage. Why were these subtleties overlooked? In addition to weaknesses in the design of these studies themselves, there were significant lapses in the comprehension of public policy. Apart from the usual ideological material that influenced some transit research, there were dubious assumptions from research folkways. 4   One important custom was the widespread assumption among researchers that tax dollars held a lower value to transit managers than ""earned"" fare revenues. Tax dollars were often considered ""found money"" that a transit manager, it was assumed, was more likely to squander than fare dollars earned from the transit fare box. On more than one occasion, transit managers were said to be ""addicted"" to Federal subsidies, as if a manager's character was undermined by Federal transit legislation. Seldom considered was the testable proposition that local tax dollars were tied to service constituencies who insisted on more services for more subsidies. Few analysts considered the probability that Federal dollars might be more highly valued and guarded because, apart from Federal guidelines, Federal subsidies carried no constituency strings. Indeed, one researcher found, from multiple regression analysis, that dedicated local tax dollars ""worsened"" performance while Federal subsidies did not.7 He speculated that this was due to uncertainty of the Federal dollars. That the Federal dollars were free from local ""political"" constraints and thus, more importantly, Federal dollars were available for more business-like expenditure, was overlooked. The implications would have been the opposite from those deduced from the ""found money"" theory. The policy conclusions from the transit cost studies conducted between 1975 and 1983 became transit conventional wisdom and so remained. Subsequent Federally-sponsored studies to test logical inferences from those cost studies did not always work out as expected. For instance, studies in the mid-1980s of transit compensation for workers and senior management failed to demonstrate incomes higher than other public employees. An accounting cost study that was expressly designed to capture change in the trends, i.e., with more than two observations in time, demonstrated that transit cost problems were greatest in the period before Federal subsidies. When the accounting approach was used on individual transit systems rather than on pooled data, the pooled cost patterns vanished.  Where Did the Resources Go? Sometimes, it costs money to save money. As Table 1.1 shows, the ""rescue"" of the U.S. transit industry during the period of increased Federal assistance, especially the operating assistance program beginning in 1975, may have been driven by efficiency improvements. Although productivity and cost trends after 1975 were not yet in the black, they were a decided improvement on the same trends before 1975. After 1975, compensation per employee increased (14 percent) at less than a third the rate before 1975 (54 percent). After 1975, expense per passenger increased (20 percent) at the less than a third the rate before 1975 (73 percent).  7  Robert Cervero, ""Cost and Performance Effects of Transit Operating Subsidies in the United States,"" International Journal of Transport Economics, Vol. X, No. 3 (December, 1983).  5   Table 1.1  Transit Cost Analysis Before and After Federal Operating Assistance Percent Change (Adjusted for Inflation) 1965 - 74 1975 - 84  Avg.

In addition to addressing efficiency problems, in the late 1970's, the transit industry was laying down the infrastructure for a seismic shift in its market. This bore fruit in the ensuing decades when the transit patronage balance (in miles) shifted from bus to rail services. Figure 1.4 shows the patronage shift from bus to rail between 1980 and 1997. 24 , 000 Bu s M i llio n 21 , 000 T r a n s it P a sse n g e r Mi l e s 18 , 000  Ra i l  15 , 000 19 80 19 84 19 88 19 92 19 96  Figure 1.4 Source:  Trends in Transit Patronage by Mode, 1980 to 1995 American Public Transit Association, Transit Fact Book, 1980-90 Editions.  6   This transition occurred despite the fact that the total capacity of rail services in 1997 amounted to only 55 percent of comparable bus capacity.8 Noteworthy too is the up-tick in bus patronage in 1997, when the introduction of electronic fare media in New York City suddenly reduced the average fare for short trips. The shift to rail paralleled a shift in average trip length, as shown in Figure 1.5.

During the 1970s and 1980s the number of suburban residents commuting via transit to central city jobs increased at the expense of central city residents commuting to central city jobs (commuting on transit to suburban jobs is negligible). This achievement required competing head to head against auto travel in congested corridors, counting on the travel time advantages of rapid transit services. Owing to their expense, such services required the financial support of motorists who did not use transit, but who would recognize the beneficial effects of competitive rapid transit in lessening traffic congestion. In recent years, public transit has been viewed in many quarters almost exclusively as a means to combat traffic congestion. Transit's value to the economy, however, is not limited to its role in helping to create travel time equilibrium in congested urban corridors. The benefits of transit are just as great--and often greater--in its other economic roles.  8  Defined as total hours operated per vehicle times the number of vehicles, with various vehicle capacities normalized by appropriate weights.

These functions recur and persist in communities throughout the U.S. First, transit provides basic mobility for households that cannot afford a car, for children and elderly people who cannot drive, and for persons with various disabilities that interfere with safe driving. This niche is defined in Table 1.2 as passengers from households with incomes below poverty (less than $6,000 per person) and passengers under 16 or over 74. Working age passengers with above poverty household incomes who choose not to own automobiles are classified as looking to transit for its location efficiency benefits. Finally, working age passengers with above poverty incomes with one or more cars in their possession are classified below as looking to transit for congestion relief. Table 1.2 Operational Definitions of Transit Market Niches Poverty Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief Below Above Above Vehicle Ownership All Categories No Autos Owned One or More Age Not 16 - 74 16 to 74 16 to 74  Using these definitions, Table 1.3 indicates that basic mobility accounted for 2.6 billion passengers (linked trips) in 1995, or 40.1 percent of total transit passengers. Location efficiency accounted for nearly 1.7 billion or 25.3 percent of total patronage. Congestion management accounted for nearly 2.3 billion or 34.7 percent of transit patronage. The different market niches evidence a diverse pattern of transit use, as shown in Table 1.4. Only 20 percent of the transit trips made by the basic mobility group were for worktrips, as contrasted with 38.8 percent of the trips made by the location efficient group and 58.6 percent for the congestion management group. For basic mobility, transit serves a wide variety of mobility purposes. The variety of purposes is less for location efficiency because more of its purposes are served by neighborhood walk trips. Worktrips dominate for congestion management, where non-discretionary travel needs during peak congestion periods make rapid transit an appealing alternative to the private car.  8   The average trip distance for basic mobility, 10.2 miles, is similar to the average distance in the U.S. The average trip distance to bypass congestion is twice as l the appeal of rapid transit particularly for lengthy journeys to work. Transit trips location efficiency, reflecting transit's role of distributing passengers across and neighborhoods and commercial centers.

As a measure of ethnic homogeneity, the share of passengers from households that identify themselves as ""white"" is lowest among the basic mobility niche (30.5 percent) and greatest in the congestion management niche (59.1 percent). The proportion of ""whites"" among the location efficiency group in 1995 was 40.1 percent. Thus, by trip purpose, trip distance, mode choice, and ethnic or racial diversity, each of the three market niches is significantly different from the other two.

As implied by the foregoing information on income and preferences, transit's three different market niches demonstrate different expectations or ""tolerances"" for transit performance. Table 1.5 shows the difference in wait times and reliability across the three niches. The relative ""dependency"" of the basic mobility group is evident in a much higher tolerance for delay (12.1 minutes) and unreliability (13.6 minutes) than is evidenced by the other two groups. People with an auto alternative, using transit to avoid traffic congestion, have average wait times of 7.3 minutes, with 9.3 minutes in variation. Similarly, above poverty households without cars experience wait times that are a little longer than those experienced by households with cars and experience a similar reliability factor. These observations are consistent with the professional  9   literature that indicates that higher income groups attach a higher value to time, especially when waiting for a bus or train.

Source: FTA analysis of 1995 NPTS Database. Table 1.6 presents reflects the degree of crowding in transit vehicles, according to the function transit is performing. As can be seen, transit vehicles are crowded or at least there is insufficient transit seating capacity in all three market niches. Slightly more crowding is experienced by basic mobility passengers, the least by passengers who look to transit as an alternative to their cars. This relative ""equality"" of crowding reflects transit's perennial need with limited resources to maintain a balance among its three constituencies, in this case making ""standees"" of passengers without discrimination. Table 1.6 Transit Performance by Market Niche: Seating Capacity Seat Unavailable Upon Boarding Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief 29.7% 26.3% 25.0%  Source: FTA analysis of 1995 NPTS Database. The following three graphs illustrate transit's cost structure in relation to transit's three market niches. Figure 1.7 arrays transit's three market niches by time of day that each trip originates. The three market niches are shown to demonstrate the cumulative effect of transit travel demand on the deployment of services and their costs. Trips made by the location efficient group, above poverty households without cars, tend to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the day, with a very mild peaking in the morning and afternoon. Trips made by people from below poverty households tend to be a little more peaked during the commuting hours. Transit use by above poverty households with cars contributes the most to the peaking of travel demand. The costs of a transit trip depends on a number of variables. The most important are the time of day (peak or off-peak), vehicle type (bus or rail), and trip distance. Based upon these cost drivers, Figure 1.8 illustrates the relative contribution of each of the three market niches to transit costs in 1995. Transit services for 34.6 percent of trips made by above poverty households with cars account for 47.6 percent of costs. This cost pattern reflects the emphasis that most transit systems place on providing a means for commuters to circumvent congested highways.  10   Million Passenger Boardings per Annum  600 500 400 300 200 100 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  34.6% 40.2% 25.2% Congestion Management  Low Cost Mobility Location Efficiency  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  Time of Day  *5.4 Billion Reported Trips + 1.15 Billion Missing Trips = 6.5 Billion Total Annual Trips  Figure 1.7 Source:  Transit Functions By Time of Day, Boardings, 1995 Author's Analysis of 1995 NPTS Data.

Figure 1.9 shows the costs remaining after the subtraction of fare revenues according to transit policy function. These estimates are equivalent to the subsidies that local, State, and Federal taxpayers provided to local transit operations in 1995. The greatest subsidies are incurred for congestion management, where 56.1 percent of public subsidies paid for 34.6 percent of transit trips in 1995. The 40.2 percent of basic mobility trips accounted for only 28.8 percent of public subsidies. Similarly, 25.2 percent of location efficiency trips incurred 15.1 percent of public subsidies.  11   Annual Operating Subsidies in Millions $800 56.1%  $600 28.8%  $400 $200 $0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  Congestion Management  15.1% Low Cost M obility Location Efficiency  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Time of Day  Figure 1.9 Source:  Transit Functions by Time of Day: Subsidies, 1995 Author's Analysis of 1995 NPTS Data.  An analysis of transit performance is not complete without an effort to measure benefits. Table 1.7 arrays transit's benefits across the three market niches or policy functions. Using econometric consumer surplus analysis, the benefits of low cost mobility were estimated at $23 billion in 1995 (an amount unlikely to change significantly from year to year). Based on auto ownership cost savings, location efficiency was estimated to be worth $20 billion in 1995. Based on cross elasticities between auto travel on congested freeways and nearby rapid transit, the travel time savings from congestion relief are estimated at $15 billion in 1995. These are imprecise measurements, representing an aggregation of benefits across a variety of circumstances. However, the scale and relative benefit amounts among transit's market niches are consistent with economic theory and with the willingness of local taxpayers to persistently support transit in serving these niches as worthwhile public policy functions.

As a summary of the ground covered, Table 1.8 reports the per trip costs, subsidies, and benefits of transit, according to the public policy functions described earlier. With a per trip benefit of $11.66, location efficiency transit services appear to generate the greatest return for the lowest subsidy ($0.85). The total net benefit of location efficiency in 1995 was $9.82 per passenger. Congestion management generated the least net benefit, $3.07. Basic mobility produced a per trip benefit in the intermediate range of $6.44.  12   Table 1.8  Per Trip Summary of Transit's Economic Performance, 1995 Cost Subsidy $ $ 1.01 2.29 $ $ $ 0.85 Benefit* 8.40 6.37 $ 11.66 Net Benefit $ $ 6.44 3.07 $ 9.82 $ 1.96 $ 1.85 $ 3.29  Basic Mobility Location Efficiency Congestion Relief *Table 1.7.

Much transit policy analysis premised upon a transit cost crisis overlooked the cost to modernize transit organizations, equipment, and deployment. During the 1970s, transit managers wrestled to forge local and fragmented transit services into regional mobility institutions. They not only succeeded in increasing transit's share of suburb to downtown commutes, they did so while simultaneously improving transit's cost structure. This brief analysis points to a pattern of policy preferences that recurs throughout the U.S. transit industry. The greatest focus of large transit systems, both old and new, has been the relief from traffic congestion. This function attracts the financial support of suburban jurisdictions with many residents who must commute in severely congested travel corridors. Owing to a relatively fixed budget since the early 1980s, the expansion of commuter services has been accomplished by squeezing the budgets of services that support pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods and services for affordable mobility.  13    Chapter 2. Standardized Measurement of Strategic Transit Corridor Performance Strategic Transit Corridors The concept of Strategic Transit Corridors (STC) was developed by the Federal Transit Administration to designate travel routes where patronage on rapid transit services measurably affects the travel times of motorists traveling between similar origins and destinations. In such circumstances, ""dynamic travel time equilibrium"" between modes is achieved and is maintained daily by travelers ""queue switching"" between modes. To observe this phenomenon in the U.S., FTA in the early 1990s conducted measurements in 17 corridors that had been screened for their severe levels of traffic congestion. The measurements confirmed the so-called Mogridge-Lewis effect (named for Martin Mogridge who explored these effects in Europe and David Lewis who examined these effects in the U.S.).9 In a second cycle, the FTA office of policy development was charged with finding a means to measure effects between modes and to monitor the effects periodically at a lower cost. The expectation is that local planners will undertake periodically to monitor this intermodal effect. Like many other public sector services, transit infrastructure throughout the U.S. is inadequately supported because analysts have depended on crude, unconvincing, and even irrelevant indices of transit performance. More importantly, the most common measures of transit performance do not furnish discrete benefit values with which to align transit costs. The unsurprising result is an perennial budget cycle in which hard and unpleasing cost numbers are compared against hopelessly ambiguous performance measures. Periodic reports on the dollar value of travel time savings that transit services provide to taxpayers, from a methodology developed by FTA, could enlighten the local budget process for transit agencies. The Equlibrium Model The researchers developed a modeling approach that begins with a baseline travel time survey to empirically establish the travel time equilibrium conditions and between-mode travel behavior effects (elasticities) in a given corridor. Once in place, the resulting analytical model enables subsequent researchers to calculate transit's changing influence as travel volume changes in the corridor. In other words, with known capacity levels and the equilibrium model for the corridor, the hour savings attributable to the Mogridge effect in subsequent readings could be calculated from volume changes in the corridor, which are readily available from the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS). These hour savings could, in turn, be translated into dollar savings based on accepted estimates of the value of time in the relevant urban area or labor market. Such a capability might appeal to local planning agencies to track the performance of transit and other strategies that are designed to manage corridor congestion. Public Choice on the Network  9  Martin J.H. Mogridge, Travel in Towns, (London: Macmillan, 1990).  15   The travel time savings for the baseline studies are subdivided according to three concepts from the literature of public choice theory. Ordinarily, these concepts are applied globally for all functions a given transit system provides to a society. In this particular application, however, we confined our interest to travel time saving on a multiple mode transportation highway-transit network whose capacity is designed for recurring peak period travel. In such networks there are three public choice transactions. First, the fare payment transaction between the transit passenger and the rapid transit service is a market transaction. Second, there is a ""club"" transaction in which travelers to the same destinations as transit passengers willingly support motor fuel taxes dedicated for highway and fungibly for transit capacity. Operationally, that is, recurring ""club"" auto trips are those for which transit offers a competitive travel time. In exchange for this support, ""club"" members who are motorists get quicker drives downtown. Third are the ""spillover"" transactions in which travel time savings on the radial arteries and the transit system spill over to improve conditions on roads and highways not necessarily sharing the same destinations.10 Methodology The study methodology for each corridor consists of four main steps: 1. Collecting highway travel data (traffic volume, distance, travel time, and vehicle occupancy in the corridor); and rail patronage data along the corridor; 2. Conducting door-to-door travel time surveys and deriving the inter-modal travel time convergence; 3. Estimating the ""with transit"" and ""without transit"" model and related curves and estimating the hours of delay saved due to transit; and 4. Quantifying delay savings by user category, namely, (i) rail riders (""market"" benefits); (ii) common segment users (""club"" benefits); and, (iii) parallel highway users (""spillover"" benefits). During the first step, Hickling Lewis Brod Decision Economics (HLB) collected Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) data, local arterial traffic data, and rail patronage data from the local Metropolitan Planning Organization and the principal transit agency. The data were used to estimate the model parameters. For the second step, data was collected on site by a survey team. A corridor, as defined in this study, is a principal transportation artery into the central business district. Multiple transportation services are available to commuters who use this artery. Additionally, during the peak period a large number of commuters utilize this route in their door-to-door commute. A statistical sample of trips was generated in the corridor by identifying random trip end points in the zones at either end of the corridor and joining them so that trips alternated between zones. These zones are catchment zones where travelers converge or diverge from either the transit 10  This conceptual framework for transit is presented in detail in David Lewis and Fred Laurence Williams, Policy and Planning as Public Choice: Mass Transit in the United States, (Aldershot, UK: Ashgate, 1999).  16   station or the principal highway route. In this study these zones are defined as the access segment and the component of the corridor common to all trips for a given mode, regardless of trip end location, is defined as the common segment. Survey crews were instructed to follow specific routes that consisted of an access segment-dependent on the catchment zone considered for the trip--and a common segment. The data collected include start times and arrival times for each segment, by mode, congestion level, seating availability, weather, road conditions, and travel costs for each segment. Data were collected over a period of three or more consecutive weeks. The days of the week were sampled to eliminate fluctuations in traffic patterns and volumes due to the day of week effects. Trips were validated to minimize the effects of unusual or circumstantial conditions. A number of valid trips were selected to ensure a statistically adequate sample size. The study employed the maps and routes connecting several zones within a residential area to several points within the central business district. Step three consisted of estimating the ""with transit"" curve based on the traffic volume and the door-to-door travel time. Using the model discussed below, the contractor derived the ""without transit"" curve and estimated the hours of delay saved due to transit. This performance metric is defined as the vertical difference between the two curves. In step four, the hours of delay saved due to transit are aggregated into three user categories. Savings by common highway-segment users are estimated using the traffic volume on the segment. Savings by transit rail riders are estimated using the ridership data for each station along the corridor. Savings by parallel highway users are estimated using traffic volume on parallel highways and arterials within the corridor. The magnitude of the savings decreases as the distance between the common segment and the arterial increases.  Methodolgy and Model Overview The methodology consists of four steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. Estimating the Corridor Performance Baseline Estimating the Corridor Performance in the Absence of transit Extrapolating Delay Savings Due to Transit Estimation of Corridor Performance without Re-calibration  Estimating the Corridor Performance Baseline The Model This model establishes a functional relationship between the person trip volume all modes--and the average door to door travel time by auto in the corridor. The door to door travel time by auto can be determined using a logistic function which calculates the door to door travel time in terms of travel time at free flow speed, trip time by high capacity rail mode, and the volume of trips in the corridor for all modes. The door to door travel time can be estimated as follows: T = (Tc - Tff) / (1 + e -( +  V1)  ) +T  ff  (1)  17   where Ta1 is auto trip time, Tc is trip time by high-capacity rail mode Tff is auto trip time at free-flow speed, V is person trip volume in the corridor by auto, and ,  are model parameters Equation 1 implies that the door to door auto trip time is equal to the trip time at free-flow speed plus a delay which depends on transit travel time and the person trip volume in the corridor. In other words, when the highway volume is close to zero, travel time is equal to travel time at free flow speed.(T = Tff). As the volume increases, the travel time is equal to Tff plus a delay due to the high volume, but adjusted to the travel time by high capacity transit. That is the high capacity transit alleviates some of the highway trip delay as some trips shift to transit. Equation 1 is transformed into a linear functional form before the parameters  and  can be estimated, the transformed equation will be: U =  +  V1 where U = ln [(Tc - Tff) / (T - Tff ) - 1] Data The data required for the estimation of the above equations are:  person trip volume on the highway which can be calculated by dividing the traffic volume by the average vehicle occupancy (auto and buses). This data are available through HPMS data base and MPO's traffic data. free flow trip time is a constant. high capacity trip time is a constant. Equation 2 is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares regression. (2)     The parameters  and  do not have to be re-estimated each year, they are both specific to the corridor and are relatively stable over the years. So periodically, the person trips volume can be inserted into Equation 1 to estimate the door to door travel time by auto.  Estimating the Corridor Performance in the Absence of transit The Model This model represents the concept to quantify the role of transit in congestion management. In the absence of transit, the travel time Ta is estimated as: Ta = Tff * (1 + A (V*)) where Ta is the door to door travel time in the absence of transit, Tff is the trip travel time at free-flow speed, V* is the volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, A is a scalar, and  is a parameter. Equation 3 implies that the door to door travel time in the absence of transit depends on the travel time at free-flow speed and the level of congestion on the road in the absence of transit. 18  (3)   The volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, however, depends on several factors:       The existing auto and bus person trips on the highway. The percentage of person transit trips shifting to auto The percentage of person transit trips shifting to bus The number of additional cars in the highway The number of additional buses in the highway The occupancy per vehicle in the absence of transit V* = V1 + 1 Vc + 2 Vb Where V1 is the existing auto volume, Vc is the transit person trips diverted to cars, Vb is the transit person trips diverted to buses, and 1, 2 are the coefficients that incorporate the passenger car equivalent factor, and the occupancy per vehicle (cars and buses). The trips diverted to cars and buses depend mainly on the degree of convergence in the corridor. This degree of convergence reflects the transit user behavior and the composition of these users. The transit users can be divided into 3 categories: Type 1: ""Explorers"" who are casual switchers and who will divert to Single Occupancy Vehicles in the absence of transit. Type 2: Commuters with low elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost and who will divert to use the bus or carpool. Type 3: Commuters with high elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost and who will forgoes the trip. The higher the degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close), the higher the shift of transit riders to cars and buses. Therefore, higher degree of convergence will lead to higher delay, which translates into higher savings due to transit. In words, Equation 3 shows that in the absence of transit and in the case of a high degree of convergence, the person trip volume is very high which translates into a high trip time (excessive delay). The relationship between trip time and person trip volume can be expressed as a convex curve (as the volume increases, travel time increases at an increasing rate). Figure 2.1 illustrates the relationship between the volume and travel time both in the presence and in the absence of transit. (4)  The volume of person trips by auto, in the absence of transit, can then be estimated as:  19   Travel Time 125 100 75 50 25 0 0  Without Transit  With Transit  25,000 Highway Traffic Volume  50,000  Figure 2.1 Source:  Washington, D.C.

Data The data required to populate this model consist of:        Highway person trip volume (used in the previous model) Transit ridership data Fleet composition (cars and buses percentages out of the total traffic) Cars and buses vehicle occupancy Passenger car equivalent factor Degree of convergence to determine the percentage person trips shifting to cars and buses Free-flow travel time which is a constant  Equation 3 is specific to the corridor and does not need to be estimated each year. It will only be necessary to re-estimate them with an updated degree of convergence if a major change is made to the transit level of service or the highway structure.  Extrapolating Delay Savings Due to Transit While the MLC hypothesis proves to be valid during the peak period only, the delay savings due to transit can be estimated during off-peak as well. This metric can be estimated as the vertical difference between the ""without transit"" curve and the ""with transit"" curve. That is at a specific person trip volume, the difference in travel times between the two cases can be defined as ""the hours of delay saved due to transit"".  20   The estimated hours of delay savings due to transit are an aggregation of three different user savings: savings by Metro riders (market benefits), savings by highway users (club benefits), and savings by users of parallel highways (spillover benefits).    The market benefits are estimated based on delay saved (which depends on the distance traveled) for each rider within the common segment. The club benefits are estimated based on the volume on the common segment using origin-destination table and the daily trip distribution. The spillover benefits are estimated based on the savings per mile, traffic volume, and the distance traveled on segments parallel to the common segment. The spillover benefits are calculated by multiplying the traffic volume with a percentage of the delay savings. This percentage decreases as the distance between the common segment and the parallel highway increases.  Estimation of Corridor Performance without Re-calibration The framework, presented above, provides an MLC-based approach to making repeated measures of transit-induced savings in corridor delay without the need for repeated MLC surveys. The approach rests on the theoretical proposition that a stable and measurable relationship exists between roadway traffic growth over time and the inter-modal (highwaytransit) equilibrium dynamics that give rise to delay savings in a congested corridor. In the absence of major changes in the level of highway supply or transit service in the corridor, this measured relationship, or model, provides a formula-based performance measurement system in lieu of a survey-based approach. In addition to the obvious cost advantages, this approach provides FTA with (i) an efficient means of measuring and comparing transit performance in strategic corridors; and (ii) a consistent performance assessment tool for transfer to MPOs throughout the country.  The Survey Data Summarized Travel time surveys were conducted on the six transit corridors listed in Table 2.1. The Maryland I-270 corridor was selected to test the current methodology against analogous survey data collected in 1994. The I-270 corridor is very heavily traveled, served by a ten-lane interstate highway, a main arterial (SR-355), and heavy rail transit services. For illustrative purposes, the I-270 results are displayed Figure 2.1 above. Except for the Chicago Midway corridor, served by heavy rail, the remaining corridors are less heavily traveled and are served by light rail transit.  21   Table 2.1  Strategic Transit Corridors, 1998 - 1999 Surveys Butterfield North Hanley Gateway Park Lane Washington I-270 Midway Airport Sacramento, CA St. Louis, MO Portland, OR Dallas, TX Washington, D.C. Chicago, IL  To further illustrate the method, data for the Washington, D.C. I-270 Red Line corridor are arrayed in Table 2.2. Market benefits for transit passengers amounted to 10,095 hours saved in 1998. Motorists traveling between similar origins and destinations in the corridor were saved 8,196 hours daily as a motor ""club"" benefit. Spillover time savings to other motorists on the network were 5,860 hours daily. Translated into dollar values and summed annually, the total network benefit (in time savings alone) amounted to $90 million in 1998. The estimated costs of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Red Line for these trips, at $3.66 per trip (1997), totaled about $60 million. Table 2.2 Washington, D.C.

I-270 Red Line transit corridor. It illustrates how the model produces new outcomes in response to travel volume change over the three-year period. The benefit amounts in the last column would concisely illumine those moments when local budgets are asked to cover Red Line services. Row one in Table 2.4 presents the total daily time saving network benefits across the six corridors. The time savings are arrayed according to public choice transaction. In these six corridors, transit passengers saved 17,443 hours daily. By removing these would-be motorists from highway segments with the same destinations as transit, transit saved motorists an additional 21,981daily hours. Other highways on the local network received spillover savings of 20,691 daily hours.  22   Table 2.3  Summary Table of Delay Savings in the Washington, D.C.

Travel time savings to commuters in these four corridors are over 901,735 per day. Again, most of these savings are to motorists ($329,728 + $310,374 = $640,102) in the six corridors. Based on the typical 250 rush hour days per year (roughly corresponding to 250 work-days), these savings sum to $225 million annually in the six corridors surveyed.

Conclusion FTA research has created a new tool for the efficient measurement of network economies produced by rapid transit in congested urban corridors. Establishment of the corridor specific analytical model requires great care. But once in place, the model can be updated regularly with ongoing Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) travel databases. With widely accepted empirical data, the model results can tell decision-makers the dollar value of transit expenditures for congestion management on a periodic basis. 1. The interaction of transportation network components produces a benefit distribution for the network that corresponds analytically to three perennial public choice budget transactions: generalized costs savings for transit passengers in exchange for their fare payments--market benefits; 2. congestion delay savings for motorists with similar destinations, whose motor fuel taxes for highways are also used for rapid transit--""club"" benefits; and 3. spillover benefits--time savings for motorists, businesses, and households which rely on other portions of the general network. 23   24   Chapter 3. Transit Benefits Based on Standard Congestion Index and Equilibrium Corridor Dynamics: A Conceptual Framework Introduction The finding of an equilibrating effect of rail transit on highway and transit travel times suggests that the effect of rail transit on highway congestion can be predicted, and shaped, by transit policy. However, the quantitative relationship between the equilibrium effect and standard measures of congestion indices, has not been identified. The objective of this paper is to establish a conceptual framework within which the standard congestion index and the equilibrium corridor dynamics are used to develop a Transit Performance Index. This transit performance index will indicate the excess delay savings due to transit. Conceptual Framework The Annual Mobility Report issued by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) provides travel conditions, in the form of congestion indices, in major urban areas in the United States. While the report provides several congestion measures, it does not quantify nor mention the contribution of transit in congestion management in these areas. HLB, however, developed for the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), a performance metric which efficiently measures transit effectiveness in congestion management. The current paper builds on the TTI congestion index, mainly the Travel Rate Index (TRI), to derive a TRI in the absence of transit. To derive the modified TRI, the framework calls for the use of the following variables: Peak period travel rate for both freeway and principal arterial street Free flow travel rate for both freeway and principal arterial street Peak Period VMT The Convergence data that are based on door-to-door travel time surveys Using the TTI standard congestion index TRI to derive the TRI, in the absence of transit, provides the following advantages: TRI in the absence of transit will be consistent with the national standard congestion index TRI Since the corridor convergence levels are stable over time, TRI in the absence of transit can be updated yearly based on the standard TRI, therefore providing a transit performance trend. TRI in the absence of transit will be based on the widely accepted HPMS database. Figure 3.1 illustrates the conceptual framework of deriving the TRI in the absence of transit based on the TTI congestion index TRI. Plan of the Chapter This chapter develops the conceptual framework for estimating the delay savings due to transit during peak period in strategic corridors. Following this introductory section, we present the methodology of the index derivation for the corridor both in the presence and in the absence of 25   transit. This includes the calculation mechanism of the congestion index and the process to estimate the index in the absence of transit using the corridor convergence data. The methods material is followed by an example of estimating the transit delay savings. The example shows the index estimation for two corridors, I-270-Washington corridor and Butterfield  Sacramento corridor.

The methodology starts by adjusting the standard TRI for a specific corridor and then uses the corridor convergence, based on the door-to-door travel time survey, to derive the TRI in the absence of transit. TTI Congestion Indices In its annual mobility report, the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) provides a set of congestion measures for about 68 urban areas in the United States. These measures are categorized as individual, area-wide, and trend measures. Individual measures consist of: Travel Rate Index: which is the extra amount of travel time during peak period compared to free flow travel. Delay per eligible driver and per capita Wasted fuel per eligible driver and per capita Congestion cost per eligible driver and per capita Areawide measures estimate the impact the congestion have on the entire urban area and include: Areawide annual travel delay Areawide wasted fuel Areawide congestion cost Amount of roadway needed each year to address congestion Vehicle occupancy change needed each year to address congestion Trend measures quantify the change in congestion level (measures shown above) for each urban area over the years. The TTI database extends from 1982 to present. To estimate the transit benefit based on congestion index, this study uses the Travel Rate Index as the basis for the calculation of transit congestion management benefits. TRI is used because it relies on HPMS data, it is estimated based on the travel speed and the VMT during peak period, and it measures the excess delay during peak period. The next section provides a definition of the TRI as well as its mathematical derivation The Travel Rate Index (TRI) Definition The Travel Rate Index (TRI) measures the additional travel time that is necessary for an individual to make a trip during the peak period. In other words, TRI measures how much longer it takes to make a trip than would be the case if the trip occurred in free-flow conditions. The TRI equation, shown below, is a weighted average of the peak period travel rates on the freeway and principal arterial streets. The TRI calculation includes an estimate of only the delay due to high traffic volumes that typically occur in the peak period on weekdays. 27   The TRI equation can be written as follows: TRI = ((FPPTR / FFFTR) * FPPVMT + ((PAPPTR / PAFFTR) * PAPPVMT) (FPPVMT + PAPPVMT) Where FPPTR is the freeway peak period travel rate, FFFTR is the freeway free flow travel rate, FPPVMT is the freeway peak period vehicle miles traveled, PAPPTR is the principal arterial peak period travel rate, PAFFTR is the principal arterial free flow travel rate, and PAPPVMT is the principal arterial vehicle miles traveled. Standard TRI Estimation The TRI is defined as the travel rate, in minutes per mile, during the peak period, divided by the rate in the off-peak. A TRI of 1.50 indicates that the average peak trip takes 50 percent longer than a trip in free-flow conditions. For example, a 30 minute trip becomes a 45 minute trip. The freeway and principal arterial peak period VMT is calculated as follows: Peak Period VMT = Daily VMT * Percentage of Travel during Congested Conditions (1) The travel rate is calculated by converting the average speed, in miles per hour, to a travel rate in minutes per mile. Travel Rate = 60 / Average Speed For example, for a region of :       freeway peak period VMT of 10 million, principal arterial street VMT of 5 million (about 50% of daily VMT), a freeway peak period travel rate of 1.3, a freeway free flow travel rate of 1.0, a principal arterial street peak period travel rate of 2.0, and a principal arterial street free flow travel rate of 1.5. (2)  The TRI will be calculated as follows: 1.31 = ((1.3 / 1.0) * 10,000,000) + ((2.0 / 1.5) * 5,000,000)) (10,000,000 + 5,000,000) Modifying TRI From a Region Basis to a Corridor Basis Index TRI uses the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) using data submitted by State Departments of  28   Transportation (DOTs). The travel speed is estimated for each roadway link using daily traffic volume per lane values. Therefore, it is feasible to select roadways in a specific corridor instead of using the entire region roadways. In fact a TRI will be much more accurate for a specific corridor, than for the entire region, because of the small number of roadways, a much accurate traffic volume number, and a much precise traffic speed level. The TRI estimation function will be similar to the function shown as Equation 1 except that the metrics will be corridor specific.  TRI in the Absence of Transit The TRI in the absence of transit is estimated using the door-to-door travel time survey data and the corridor convergence level. The approach consists of four main steps: 1. Estimate the corridor travel time, in the absence of transit, based on the methodology presented in Chapter 2. 2. Convert travel time to traffic rate in the absence of transit based on the roadways length, traffic volume, and the average speed. 3. Calculate the freeway and principal arterial peak period VMT, in the absence of transit based on the corridor convergence level and the rail passenger diversion into cars and buses. 4. Estimate the TRI, in the absence of transit, using Equation 1 and the variables estimated in Steps 2 and 3. Travel Time in the Absence of Transit Based on the methodology developed in Chapter 2, in the absence of transit, the travel time Ta is estimated as: Ta = Tff * (1 + A (V*)) Where Ta is the door to door travel time in the absence of transit, Tff is the trip travel time at free-flow speed, V* is the volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, A is a scalar, and  is a parameter. Equation 3 implies that the door-to-door travel time in the absence of transit depends on the travel time at free-flow speed and the level of congestion on the road in the absence of transit. The volume of person trips by auto in the absence of transit, however, depends on several factors: The existing auto and bus person trips on the highway. The percentage of person transit trips shifting to auto The percentage of person transit trips shifting to bus The number of additional cars in the highway The number of additional buses in the highway The occupancy per vehicle in the absence of transit (3)  29   The volume of person trips by auto, in the absence of transit, can then be estimated as: V* = V1 + 1 Vc + 2 Vb Where V1 is the existing auto volume, Vc is the transit person trips diverted to cars, Vb is the transit person trips diverted to buses, and 1, 2 are the coefficients that incorporate the passenger car equivalent factor and the occupancy per vehicle (cars and buses). The trips diverted to cars and buses depend mainly on the degree of convergence in the corridor. This degree of convergence reflects the transit user behavior and the composition of these users. The transit users can be divided into 3 categories: Type 1: ""Explorers"" who are casual switchers who will divert to Single Occupancy Vehicles in the absence of transit. Type 2: Commuters with low elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost who will divert to use the bus or carpool. Type 3: Commuters with high elasticity of demand with respect to generalized cost who will forgoes the trip. The higher the degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close), the higher will be the shift of transit riders will be to cars and buses. Therefore, higher degree of convergence will lead to higher delay which translates into higher savings due to transit. Equation 3 shows that in the absence of transit and in the case of a high degree of convergence, the person trip volume is very high. This translates into a high trip time (excessive delay). The relationship between trip time and person trip volume can be expressed as a convex curve. As the volume increases, travel time increases at an increasing rate. The figure below illustrates the relationship between the volume and travel time in the presence and absence of transit. Converting Travel Time in the Absence of Transit to Travel Rate in the Absence of Transit The average travel speed, in the absence of transit, can be derived using the travel time in the absence of transit and the corridor length. The travel speed in the absence of transit (TSAT) is estimated as follows: TSAT = 60 * Corridor length Travel time in the absence of transit The travel rate in the absence of transit can be estimated as shown in Equation 2, that is dividing the free flow travel speed by the travel speed in the absence of transit. Estimation of Peak Period VMT in the Absence of Transit Peak period VMT (obtai transit. The the occupan Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), in the absence of transit, consists of the existing ned from HPMS databases) and the estimated generated VMT in the absence of generated VMT in the absence of transit depends on the rail transit ridership level, cy per vehicle (for cars and buses) and the level of convergence in the corridor. (5) (4)  30   Higher degree of convergence (auto and rail door to door travel times are very close) means a higher shift of transit riders to cars and buses. The peak period VMT in the absence of transit can be estimated as follows: VMT1 = VMT0 + ATL * TP * ( / CVO +  /BVO) Where VMT1 is the overall VMT in the absence of transit, VMT0 is the VMT in the presence of transit, ATL is the corridor average trip length, TP is the transit rail passenger (ridership volume), CVO is the corridor average vehicle occupancy for cars BVO is the corridor average vehicle occupancy for buses  is the percentage of rail passenger diverting to cars in the absence of transit  is the percentage of rail passenger diverting to buses in the absence of transit  and  depend on the convergence level in the corridor, the percentage of diversion to cars and buses is higher when a high convergence level exist between in the rail transit travel time and highway travel time. VMT1 will be estimated for both freeways and principal arterial streets and will replace the VMTs values shown in Equation 1. Similarly, travel rate in the absence of transit will be estimated for both the freeways and principal arterial streets and for both peek and off-peak periods to replace travel rates in Equation 1. Estimation of TRI in the Absence of Transit Estimating travel rate index in the absence of transit consists of updating Equation 1 using the corridor travel rates and VMTs, in the absence of transit, shown above. The TRI in the absence of transit (TRIAT) can be estimated as follows: TRIAT = (FSL / FTSAT) * FVMT1 + (PAFFTSAT / PATSAT) * PAVMT FVMT1 + PAVMT Where FSL is the freeway speed limit, FTSAT is the freeway peak period travel speed in the absence of transit FVMT1 is the freeway peak period VMT in the absence of transit PAFFTSAT is the principal arterial free flow travel speed in the absence of transit PATSAT is the principal arterial peak period travel speed in the absence of transit PAVMT is the principal arterial peal period VMT in the absence of transit Equation 7 will be estimated for a specific corridor instead of the region. The data to populate the model will be gathered from the HPMS databases and through the corridor travel time survey. 1 1  (6)  (7)  31   Transit Benefit Based on the TRI Congestion Index Once the TRI in the presence of transit and in the absence of transit have been calculated, the transit benefit can be estimated as the difference between the two indices. This difference can be interpreted as the percentage of travel time savings solely attributable to transit during peak period. A TRI in the presence of transit of 1.3 and in the absence of transit of 1.4 indicates that the average peak trip takes 10 percent longer in the absence of transit than in the presence of transit in the selected corridor. Using TTI measurements, the travel time percentage savings due to transit can be quantified as the annual total delay savings in the corridor, the delay per driver in the corridor, the delay per capita in the corridor, and/or the fuel consumption savings in the corridor. Example of Transit Benefit Estimation Using TRI We the this the now present an application example of the methodology, using the example of two corridors, I-270  Washington corridor and the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor. Since the purpose of paper is to build a conceptual framework to apply a standard congestion index to measure transit benefits, this example relies on assumptions and proxy data when necessary.  Corridors Characteristics The selected corridors are both listed within congested areas by the TTI. Table 3.1 summarizes HLB findings for these corridors and provides TTI findings on their respective urban areas.

TRI in The Presence of Transit TRI in the presence of transit is estimated for each corridor by estimating the travel rate and the VMT for the corridor roadways only. Table 3.2 shows the data used to estimate the TRI in the presence of transit for each corridor. 11 12  TTI findings are based on the region where the corridor is located Include savings by transit users and highway users throughout the network.  32   Table 3.2  Corridor Data* Used to Estimate the TRI in the Presence of Transit Corridor I-270 - Washington 1,756,387 962,500 60% 29.2 55 21.1 35 30 Butterfield-Sacramento 523,059 416,259 50% 44.3 60 23.2 35 30  Daily Freeway VMT** Daily Principal Arterial VMT Percentage of Travel during Peak Period Freeway Peak Period Travel Speed Freeway Free Flow Travel Speed Principal Arterial Peak Period Travel Speed Principal Arterial Free Flow Travel Speed Principal Arterial off peak Travel Speed  *The figures are based on HPMS data and data from local DOTs and MPOs (see corridor case studies for detail data on each corridor). ** The estimation assumes that the I-270 corridor represents about 5% of the total Washington region VMT. For the I-270 Washington Corridor, the TRI in the presence of transit (TRIPT) can then be estimated as: TRIPT Washington  ={(55/29.2)*(1756,387 * .60)} + {((35/21.1) / (35/30) ) * ( 962,500 * .60)} = 1.72 (1756,387 + 962,500) * .60  This TRI value of 1.72 indicates that it takes 72 percent longer to make a trip in the I-270 corridor during peak period than it would take if the travel occurred at free-flow speeds. Similarly, the TRI in the presence of transit for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor can be estimated as: TRIPT Sacramento  = {(60/44.3) * (523,059 * .50)} + {((35/23.2)/(35/30)) * (416,259 * .50)} = 1.33 (523,059 + 416,259) * .50  The TRI value of 1.33 indicates that it takes 33 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor during peak period than it would be if the travel occurred at free flow speeds. The calculation also shows that there is a higher level of congestion in the I-270 Washington corridor than in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor, mainly due to higher traffic volume and lower speed in the I-270 corridor. TRI in the Absence of Transit The estimation of the TRI in the absence of transit is conducted by substituting the VMTs and travel speeds in the presence of transit with the values estimated in the absence of transit. Table  33   3.3 shows the data used to estimate the TRI in the absence of transit. The free flow travel speed and the percentage of travel during peak period are similar to the ones listed in Table 3.2.

Using the estimated values, shown in Table 3.3, the I-270 Washington Corridor TRI in the absence of transit (TRIAT) can be estimated as: TRIAT Washington  ={(55/24.51)*(1,826,398*.60)}+{((35/17.9)/(35/15.04))*(1,009,174 * .60)}=1.98 (1,826,398 + 1,009,174) * .60  This TRI value of 1.98 indicates that it would almost twice longer to make a trip in the I-270 corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take if the travel occurred at free-flow speeds. Similarly, the estimation for the TRI in the absence of transit for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor can be estimated as follows: TRIATSacramento={(60/36.9) * (546,544 * .50)} + {((60/22.64) / (35/30)) * (431,916 * .50)} =1.49 (546,544 + 431,916) * .50 The TRI value of 1.49 indicates that it would take 49 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield Sacramento corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would be if the travel occurred at free flow speeds.  34   Transit Delay Savings During Peak Period The transit contribution in the reduction of travel time delays during peak period can be estimated by taking the difference between the TRI in the presence of transit and the TRI in the absence of transit. For the I-270  Washington corridor, the transit contribution to congestion management can be estimated as: TCCM Sacramento  = TRIATSacramento  TRIPTSacramento = 1.98 / 1.72 = 0.15%  The value of 0.26 indicates that it would take 15 percent longer to make a trip in the I-270  Washington corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take in the presence of transit. Using the annual person hours of delay estimated by TTI for the Washington region of 216 million, and assuming that the I-270 corridor VMT represents about five percent of the total VMT in the Washington region, the total delay savings attributed to transit in the I-270 Washington corridor will be over 4 million person hours that can be valued at about $62 million per year. Similarly, for the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor, the transit contribution to congestion management (TCCM) as: TCCM Washington  = TRIAT  Washington   TRIPT  Washington  = 1.49 / 1.33 = 0.12%  The value of 0.16 indicates that it would take 12 percent longer to make a trip in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor during peak period in the absence of transit than it would take in the presence of transit. Using the annual person hours of delay estimated by TTI for the Sacramento region of 35 million, and assuming that the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor VMT represents about five percent of the total VMT in the Sacramento region, the total delay savings attributed to transit in the Butterfield  Sacramento corridor will be around .86 million person hours that can be valued at about $13 million per year.  Conclusion The finding of an equilibrating effect of rail transit on highway and transit travel suggests that the effect of rail transit on highway congestion can be predicted, and shaped, by transit policy. However, the quantitative relationship between the equilibrium effect and standard measures of congestion has not been identified. In fact, while the TTI publications on mobility and the congestion levels in urban areas in the United States provide a quantification of the infrastructure needs to lower congestion, they do not mention the role and the effect of transit on congestion management. This paper develops the conceptual framework within which transit-induced changes in highway travel times (as a result of measured equilibrium effects) translate into reduced congestion, as measured by the TTI indices. The methodology in this paper uses the travel rate index TRI calculation framework to estimate the TRI in the presence of transit for a specific corridor. Then it uses the corridor convergence level to estimate the TRI in the absence of transit. The difference between the two indices measures the percentage of excess delay savings due to rail transit in the corridor. The paper uses data from two corridors to illustrate the estimation mechanism of the transit contribution to congestion management. Using the framework developed in this paper, transit is 35   found to save over 4 million person hours per year in excess delay during peak period in the I270 Washington corridor and about .86 million person hours per year in the ButterfieldSacramento corridor. These delay savings are estimated at about $61 million and $13 million, respectively.  36   Chapter 4. Economically Optimal Transit Subsidies in the United States, An Update for 1999 Introduction Transit and highways together comprise a system of urban transportation. The policy imperative for transportation is to recognize the reality of political and institutional barriers and to achieve efficient use of society's resources subject to those constraints. The lack of road pricing is a significant constraint on consumer sovereignty on the transportation system. Without a pricing mechanism as a means to save their own money or time by prudent use of the road network, motorists generate inefficient levels of highway congestion. Until market-based road and parking pricing become feasible on a significant scale, therefore, the optimal policy response to traffic congestion is to subsidize the transit mode, calculated at $19.4 billion for the U.S. in 1999. Congestion, Road Pricing and Welfare Prospective commuters weigh the benefits and costs that they face when choosing between alternative modes (i.e., transit or highways). The costs not fully borne by the individual, including the congesting effect of an additional private vehicle on the road, do not generally enter his/her calculations. ""Second-best"" policy options are pragmatic responses to the reality that absent marginal cost road pricing the congesting effect of travelers do not enter private calculations. Economic theory then suggests that all travelers, whether car users or not, can be made better off if the new users are charged a special toll. For instance, they could pay a toll to cover the additional social costs they impose (in economic terms, making consumers better off is also expressed as increasing their welfare). Of course, such a ""congestion"" toll (also known as road pricing) is unlikely, owing to institutional and political barriers. In effect, there remains a distortion in the price of road travel created by uncompensated social costs. Failure to address this price distortion leads to inefficient levels of congestion and slower travel times. Attendant negative effects include time and productivity losses for road users, higher costs of production, and possibly higher levels of pollution (NAS, 1994). The Case for Subsidizing Transit In the world as it is, all travelers can still be made better off (if not as well off as in the ""firstbest"" world) if a ""compensating variation"" can be introduced into prices in other, related sectors of the economy (Laffont, 1989). Indeed, the solution may seem paradoxical: if road travel is under-priced (i.e., there exists no road pricing to discourage additional congestion), then it is justified to under-price the cost of travel on other modes. More precisely, fares on public transit would be subsidized, so that transit users would pay less than what it costs to transport them. The reasoning behind this seeming paradox is the following: a subsidy draws potential auto travelers to transit, thus averting additional congestion (this result depends on the fact that mass transit causes less congestion than does road travel). In fact, in the absence of road pricing, subsidizing some travelers not to use roads makes everyone better off, road and transit users alike as long as the subsidy is less than the congestion costs imposed by each additional driver. Subsidies are set such that, for the last prospective auto traveler they attract to transit, they  37   exactly offset the additional congestion costs to all current road users that would have occurred had that person decided to use a car instead. Plan of the Report The next section reviews research on the pricing of public transit. It focuses on how both road and transit users' welfare can be maximized in the absence of road pricing. We then introduce a methodological framework to estimate ""second-best"" transit subsidies in the United States.  Background Studies by Glaister, Lewis (1978) and others in Europe during the 1970s and 80s indicate that subsidizing transit services is an economically efficient response to the political and institutional barriers to road pricing. The authors adapted the general theory of ""second-best"" in a methodology for calculating the optimal subsidy for public transit when roads are systematically under-priced. This methodology combines cross-price elasticities of the various transportation modes with the social marginal costs of each into a model that generates the optimal set of prices for each mode (cross-price elasticities refer to the responsiveness of consumers to price changes on alternative travel modes). The Social Costs of Road Travel The argument in favor of subsidizing public transit follows from the under-pricing of road travel. In the absence of marginal-cost pricing, individual drivers do not take into account the congestion they impose on others when making travel decisions. The theory of second-best says that, when prices deviate from their marginal (social) cost in one sector, then using marginal-cost pricing in other, related sectors will not lead to a social optimum. In the case at hand, road use is under-priced due to lack of tolls and intense congestion levels. Indeed, society would be better off by subsidizing transit fares, thus drawing travelers away from road use and reducing the social costs they previously imposed on other road users. Opponents of subsidies to public transit argue that cross-price elasticities are so small and transit's share of the total transportation market so insignificant that most analysts assume the optimal transit subsidies derived by this approach would also be insignificant. Evidence from Dr. Herbert Mohring and Dr. David Anderson (1996) suggests that, even in lightly congested urban areas such as Minneapolis/St. Paul, the optimal congestion toll on highways may be as high as $0.49 per mile (the study was conducted in 1996). Estimates of this magnitude suggest that the social costs of driving may be higher than previously thought. If the cross-price elasticities between road use and public transit were significant, then the subsidization of public transit would lead to large (social) cost savings. Furthermore, research by HLB Decision Economics Inc. indicates that a certain class of travelers may be especially sensitive to relative prices among transportation modes. These travelers are ""explorers"" who frequently switch modes. They are sensitive to price when choosing travel modes and might switch to transit based on the optimal transit fare. Taken together, the high social costs of congestion, the presence of ""explorers"" and the historically significant cross-price elasticities between road use and public transit argue for a thorough examination of transit subsidy policy. 38   The ""Second-Best"" Alternative Currently, transit operations and capital spending are subsidized by many levels of government. Since the distribution of transit operating funds does not currently account for the economic efficiency of the ""second-best"" optimal subsidy, it is likely that some of these current subsidies are too low or too high to yield the economically efficient fare structure given road underpricing. Subsidies can only be ""efficient"" in an economy operating in what economists have called a ""second-best"" world. The ""first best"" policy response to under-priced of roads would be to price roads at the social marginal costs of driving. Marginal cost pricing is a fundamental indicator of the efficient allocation of resources. The theory of ""second-best"" suggests other outcomes when this ""first best"" outcome is unachievable. The theory of ""second-best"" states, generally, that when a distortion (under-priced roads) exists in one sector, traditional optimality conditions (marginal cost pricing) do not necessarily apply in all other sectors. In essence, the results obtained in a ""second-best"" analysis may contradict the intuition based on a first best analysis. In this case, the optimality of transit subsidies derives from the under-pricing of roads. Since automobile travel creates negative effects in terms of congestion and pollution, reducing auto travel demand will have economic benefits as long as the marginal cost of inducing a driver to take transit is less than the marginal social cost imposed by driving.  Framework for Optimal Transportation Prices In the 1970's, Glaister and Lewis (1978) developed a method for calculating the optimal (i.e., welfare-maximizing) fare structure for public transit when road pricing is not a viable option. The author's method has withstood scrutiny since then and remains a standard reference in the literature on economic welfare and public transit. The argument is that since private vehicle users are charged less than their marginal social cost (the marginal social cost is the social cost associated with newest road user) of driving, particularly during congested conditions, there is an economic rationale for pricing public transport below its marginal cost to induce drivers to switch to public transit. This conclusion rests on the actual marginal social costs of driving and on the ability of reductions in transit fares to attract travelers away from road use. This paper adopts the Glaister and Lewis method and presents a new application of the model using risk analysis techniques. These techniques account for the inherent uncertainty in many of the model's inputs. The model also incorporates recent advances in the ability to determine the marginal social costs of automobile travel. The Framework A detailed derivation of the model is presented in technical form Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach. The central element of the ""second-best"" theory is the congestion to all traffic caused by an additional private vehicle during peak-period automobile travel. Under congested conditions, each additional automobile in the transportation network imposes high costs in terms of congestion (lost time and inconvenience) upon all vehicles in the affected  39   transportation network. Because each additional vehicle does not pay for the costs imposed on other transportation network users, it is referred to as an external cost. The theory incorporates this external congestion effect to show that, when the various transportation modes are substitutes for each other, transit subsidies can be an efficient (i.e., welfare-maximizing) policy response to congestion in the absence of correct road pricing. Implications of the ""Second-Best"" Result The degree to which transit subsidization creates net benefits depends on the ability of fare reductions for transit to attract travelers away from road use and, in addition, on volumes and shares on the various modes, and the actual marginal social costs of automobile travel. The ""second-best"" transit subsidy ensures that the price of transit, relative to automobile travel is optimal, or welfare maximizing. This results in the most efficient distribution of traffic across modes and ensures that transit and road users benefit mutually. The theory suggests that the optimal fares on public transit modes are below their marginal costs in both peak and off-peak periods. Subsidies are justified in the peak period because lower fares induce mode switching from auto to public transit, which reduces traffic congestion. Subsidies during off-peak periods are justified because they induce people to travel in the off-peak period, reducing peak-period congestion. Model Structure and Data The second-best solution to the transit subsidy problem uses an analytical method well grounded in economic theory to combine data on (i) the marginal social cost of automobile use; (ii) the marginal social cost of transit (for bus and rail separately); (iii) the responsiveness of the demand for bus and rail service to fare changes; and (iv) the responsiveness of the demand for auto use with respect to bus and rail fares. The complete derivation of the model is presented in the Technical Annex at the end of this chapter. Table 4.1 below presents the elasticities that were used in the analysis. These elasticities were estimated by Glaister and Lewis (1978) and represent conservative estimates compared to many recent studies in the literature (Button, 1993). They measure the responsiveness of travelers using a current mode of transportation (say, a car) to changes in the prices of other modes (say, a bus). For example, an elasticity of demand of 0.025 for auto travel with respect to bus fares would show that an increase of 100% in bus fares would lead to a 2.5% increase in the number of auto travelers. For higher elasticities between transit and auto use, drivers are more responsive to fare reductions, which would relieve congestion more easily. The elasticities used in this model would seem low, and the resulting benefits from congestion relief would be similarly conservative. The responsiveness of automobile drivers to transit fares is estimated to be extremely small. But even small degrees of automobile driver responsiveness to transit fares can translate into significant levels of efficient subsidies (see Table 4.3). The model is calculated using operating costs for seven metropolitan areas. It also includes capital costs in the amount used for current system renovation, maintenance and improvement, omitting all capital spending on new systems and segments.  40   Capital Subsidies Governments typically provide nearly all of the capital improvement budgets for transit agencies. This issue is problematic for the calculation of the optimal subsidies because the portion of the capital budget that is directed toward expanding capacity or extending a transit line will have demand impacts in the future that will not show up in current year data.

This analysis takes the current transportation infrastructure as given. A major portion of capital expenditures represents infrastructure expansions that become usable in the future. This analysis is a tool for determining the optimal transit subsidies, given the current infrastructure, and does not give any guidance regarding the wisdom or impact of new capital expenditures. New investments should be subjected to rigorous cost-benefit analysis to determine whether they yield adequate net benefits. Some portion of capital expenditures is used for general maintenance of the current infrastructure. This amount should be considered part of current operating subsidies since this spending is required to maintain the transportation system in its current state (see Table 4.2). Unfortunately, current data on the precise distribution of capital costs does not exist for most transit agencies.

Data regarding the distribution of capital costs were, in fact, collected by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) up to 1991 only. By calculating the percentage of capital funds applied to existing infrastructure in 1991, and applying this percentage to capital funding levels in 1993, an estimate of the capital funds applied to existing infrastructure has been generated. The implicit assumption in the calculation is that the composition of capital spending in 1993 is approximately the same as 1991. The present report considers that capital spending on existing equipment and infrastructure in 1997 is equal to what it was in 1993. Operating expenses, on the other hand, have been updated with 1997 data.13  Results and Conclusions In order to account for uncertainty in model inputs, the second-best model was applied using risk analysis techniques. Rather than relying on point estimates for model inputs, the risk analysis approach uses ranges for all model inputs to account for uncertainty. The risk analysis results provide policy makers with a quantitative basis to make decisions that fully accounts for uncertainty. Model Results Optimal fares were calculated for seven large U.S. metropolitan areas14 and for the nation as a whole. The simulation results are presented in Table 4.3 below. The table shows the subsidies that should be given to transit authorities in order to enable them to charge a welfare-maximizing or ""second-best"" fare given their current operating costs and capital expenditures on current infrastructure. Since the second-best model developed in this paper assumes that the infrastructure is given, the correct subsidy predicted by this model should be interpreted as an operating and maintenance subsidy. Conclusions The results of our analysis confirm that subsidizing public transportation can be the best public policy approach to utilizing the transportation infrastructure in the absence of road pricing. This analysis suggests the optimal subsidy levels in major metropolitan areas can be large (see Table 4.3) based solely on transit's congestion management benefits (transit costs include many costs not related to congestion management - examples of these are paratransit services and low-cost mobility programs, among others). The optimal subsidy exceeds the current subsidy in many of these systems and the nation as a whole.  13  Capital expenditures on existing equipment and infrastructure represent a relatively small portion of the social costs of operating transit systems. The impact of using 1993 instead of 1997 capital cost estimates is, therefore, likely to be small. As defined in the 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration  14  42   The central result of this study is that all travelers on the highways and transit systems could be made better off by increasing transit subsidy levels in several major metropolitan areas. This conclusion is, of course, a ""second-best"" argument where alternative policies toward congestion management, such as road pricing, are deemed not feasible for political or practical reasons. The model presented here would suggest that the optimal subsidy would decline as the fees that drivers face approach the marginal social cost of automobile travel.

The ""second-best"" approach provides a means of improving the allocation of resources among the available transportation modes when the first best approach is unavailable.  Risk Analysis We attached probability density functions to each variable in the second-best model and applied Monte-Carlo simulations in order to gain an appreciation of sensitivity in the results.

The model could benefit from a further refinement, given the conservatism of the elasticities used in this paper. Indeed, the likelihood of drivers switching to transit when fares decrease could be understated. The elasticities, which measure this responsiveness, could be re-estimated based on current data specific to each metropolitan area. Incorporate Environmental Impacts into the Model. This model, in focusing on congestion costs exclusively, does not account for other costs of automobile use. Significant among these are the environmental costs of automobile emissions. Including the social marginal costs of automobile based pollution would improve the analysis and would increase the estimated optimal subsidy level. Research on the costs of pollution could be integrated into the ""second-best"" model in future applications. In concluding, the results of our analysis confirm that subsidizing existing public transportation can cause congestion relief benefits. This conclusion is, of course, in a ""second-best"" world where significant road pricing remains either politically or institutionally infeasible.  44   Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach Throughout this paper and in keeping with the original Glaister - Lewis framework, we use the following indices: 1 : Peak hour private vehicle 2 : Off-peak private vehicle 3 : Peak hour bus Elasticities The cross-price elasticity of demand for transportation services on mode i with respect to prices on mode j will be given by the standard equation for price elasticity as follows: 4 : Off-peak bus 5 : Peak hour rail 6 : Off-peak rail  p j X i pj = i = i X ij , i, j = 1, ... ,6 X p j X i j  (1)  Where pi Xi are the prices on mode i in $ per passenger mile, and are the demands on mode i in passenger miles.  If cross-price elasticities of auto travel with respect to public transit fares are estimated to be zero, implying that there is no way of persuading automobile users to switch to buses or rail transit regardless of price, then the Glaister-Lewis model would predict that transit fares should be set at the marginal cost of delivering service. If these elasticities do not equal zero, some level of transit subsidy will be efficient in the absence of road pricing. Deriving the Equation System Glaister-Lewis conceived of the consumer's problem as a maximization of the consumer's expenditure function less the operating costs of the various public transit modes. The maximization, following the Glaister-Lewis paper, can be expressed as follows: 1 3 max {G ( 3 ,  4 ,  5 ,  6 , X ( 3 , ... ,  6 ), X ( 3 , ... ,  6 ), p, u ) 6  p3 , p 4 , p5 , p  - G ( p3 , p 4 , p5 , p6 , X 1 ( p3 , ... , p6 ), X 3 ( p 3 , ... , p6 ), p, u ) - [C 3 ( X 1 , X 3 ) - p3 X 3 ] - [C 4 ( X 4 ) - p 4 X 4 ] - [C 5 ( X 5 ) - p5 X 5 ] - [C 6 ( X 6 ) - p6 X 6 ]}  45   Where G(p, X1, X3, p,u) Xi (p3,...,p6) p u C i  is the expenditure function aggregated across individuals, is the traffic level for mode i is a vector of transit fares, is a vector of all other prices including p1 and p2., is a vector of constant utility levels, and are the operating costs of the public transit modes.  The expenditure function, representing the long run demand responses to prices, depends on peak car and bus traffic levels because of the negative effects of congestion on consumer utility. This relationship implies that for a given vector of prices, an increase in peak traffic requires a compensating increase in income to maintain the previous level of consumer utility. This relationship is known as the compensating variation and is given by the difference between expenditure function evaluated at the ""reference"" prices i and a lower set of prices pi. The compensating variation is the amount of money that would be required to compensate for an increase from p3,...,p6 to 1,..., 6, where the i's represent higher peak-hour congestion levels than the p's. The other terms within the [ ] are the operating subsidies required for the peak and off-peak bus and rail transit services. The compensating variation and the public transit fare revenues (piXi) represent consumers' total willingness-to-pay from which the transit systems' operating expenses (Ci(Xi)) must be subtracted. Equation 2 is differentiated with respect to p3, p4, p5, and p6. Differentiating Equation 2 with respect to p3 yields one of four first-order conditions for a maximum as follows: -  G G 1 G 3 31 33 X3 - X 3 - C1 X 3 - C 3 X 3 + X - 1 p 3 X X 3 4 3  3 6 3 6 3  3 4 + p3 X 3 - C 4 X  + p4 X  4 3  5 - C5 X  5 3  + p5 X  5 3  6 - C6 X  + p6 X  =0  (2) Similar expressions are obtained from differentiating with respect to p4, p5 and p6. Using the following properties and definitions:  G = p i   h  g h = pi   h  i xh = X i ,  S1 =  G C 3 G C 3 + 1 and S3 = + . X 1 X X 3 X 3  (3)  Where S1 is the marginal social cost of peak automobile travel per passenger mile and S3 represents the marginal social cost of peak bus travel per passenger mile.

Optimal Fares and Subsidies System of Equations The equation system that allows the calculation of the ""second-best"" optimal fare derives from the four first-order conditions for the maximization problem in Equation 2. The first order conditions, after converting to elasticity form, reduce to:  [ [ [ [  4 5 6  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  3 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  3 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  3 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 3  6  ] ] ] 6  1 S1 X 1 S1 X 1 S1 X  1  = = = 1  1 3   3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  4 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 4 4 4 4 4  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  5 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 5 5 5  6  1  1 4  6  1  1 5  4  3 ( p 3 - S 3 ) X 3 +  63 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 +  5 ( p 5 - C 55 ) X 5 +  6 ( p 6 - C 66 ) X 6 6 6  ]  1 S1 X  =  1 6  (5 a-d) This system of equations fully identifies the optimal transit pricing structure in the absence of road pricing. This system can be written in matrix notation as follows:         3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6       4 3 4 4 4 5 4 6       5 3 5 4 5 5 5 6       6 3 6 4 6 5 6 6          ( p3  ( p4  ( p5   ( p 6  - - - -  S3 C4 C5 C6  )X 3 )X 4 )X 5 )X 6       1 =   S1 X 1        1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6         (6)  47   Solving the System The preceding system of equations is a set of four equations with four unknowns, which is solvable using linear algebra techniques. The object of this project is to determine the values of the p's in the equations from which the optimal subsidy levels can be calculated. This model can be applied to transportation systems with automobile, bus and rail modes. When rail is not available, the system of equations reduces to two equations with two unknowns as follows:  [ [  4  3 ( p3 - S3 ) X 3 +  3 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 3  4  ] ]  1 = S1 X 1 1 = S1 X 1  1 3  (7)   3 ( p3 - S3 ) X 3 +  4 ( p 4 - C 44 ) X 4 4  4  1 4  The difficulty in solving the system increases rapidly with the number of modes and periods under consideration. This system can be expressed as a linear system and solved using matrix inversion. This system does not provide explicit solutions for the optimal fares, but these can be calculated using some assumed functional forms for the demand and cost functions. Applying matrix inversion and solving for the auto-bus-rail system will result in a numerical solution for the column vector (the auto-bus case results in numerical solutions for the first two elements of the following vector):  ( p3  ( p 4 ( p5   ( p 6 - - - - S3 C4 C5 C6 )X )X )X )X 3 4 5 6    1  S1 X     1  (8)  Estimates for Si, Ci, and Xi can be obtained or estimated from secondary sources and using standard functional forms for the cost and demand functions. The pi`s can then be determined by simple algebra.  48   Annex 4.2 Data for the ""Second-Best"" Model Secondary data sources provide a set of parameters with which to calculate the optimal subsidies for a set of transit systems. The original Glaister-Lewis paper relied on a set of secondary sources augmented by sensitivity analysis to account for uncertainty in some of their variables. This application of the methodology is augmented by risk analysis to account for uncertainty surrounding the values chosen to estimate the equation system. Input Requirements In order to estimate pi, the second-best price for each mode on-peak and off, all other variables in the system, presented in Annex 4.1 ""Second-Best"" Technical Approach, must be estimated or identified. The inputs needed to solve this system are presented in Table 4.5. Table 4.5 Variable i j  Input Requirements for Second-Best Model Description Cross-price elasticity of demand* for mode i with respect to prices on mode j for i,j {1,...6}. Marginal social cost of private vehicle travel per passenger mile during peak hour. Marginal social cost of bus travel per passenger mile during peak hour. Operating costs of the off-peak bus transit per passenger mile. Operating costs of the peak rail transit per passenger mile. Operating costs of the off-peak rail transit per passenger mile. Demand for peak auto travel in passenger miles. Demand for peak bus travel in passenger miles. Demand for off-peak bus travel in passenger miles. Demand for peak rail travel in passenger miles. Demand for off-peak rail travel in passenger miles.  S1 S3 C C C 4 5 6  X1 X3 X X X 4 5 6  * The cross-price elasticity of demand for commodity i with respect to the price of commodity j is the responsiveness of the consumers' demand for commodity i (in percentage terms) to a change in the price of commodity j (also in percentage terms).  Data Sources and Tables We have chosen to adopt the Glaister-Lewis estimates for the elasticities, as updated by HLB. These elasticities were derived from the economics literature and from previous work by Lewis (1977). Table 4.1 above displays the adopted elasticity estimates. The marginal social cost variables need to be determined. The marginal social cost of bus service is a combination of congestion costs and system operating costs. The estimates used in this analysis were obtained from Mohring and Anderson (1996) and combined with bus system operating costs as reported in Section 15. The results are shown in Table 4.6 below.  49   Table 4.6  Marginal Social Cost Estimates Variable Marginal Social Cost of Car Travel Marginal Social Cost of Bus Travel Adopted Value $0.57 per passenger mile $0.46 per passenger mile  Source:  Mohring, H. and D. Anderson (1996), TTI 1999 Annual Mobility Report and HLB estimates.  Operating costs for the public transit system are based on available system operating cost data found in the 1997 National Transit Database Transit Profiles (FTA). In the model, there are no congestion costs off-peak. The only justification, according to this modeling structure, for subsidizing off-peak transit service is to shift travelers from peak to off-peak period travel, reducing peak congestion. Demand estimates for 1997 were derived from the National Transit Database Transit Profiles and from the Texas Transportation Institute 1999 Annual Mobility Report (TTI, 1999). A log-linear functional form was assumed for the demand function based on price of service and the elasticity estimates in Table 4.5. Other functional forms can be used in this model depending on the preference of the analyst. The only limitation on the adoption of functional demand equations, is that functional forms must contain variables that are either determined by the model or known values, in order to maintain the solvable ""four equations and four unknowns"" equation system structure presented in Annex 4.1.  50   Table 4.7  Summary Table for Model Inputs BUS RAIL 1.736 1.157 5.068 $0.201 $0.469 1.396 0.931 6.937 $0.223 $0.519 1.865 1.243 5.684 $0.185 $0.431 2.029 1.353 9.212 $0.183 $0.427 3.990 2.660 11.009 $0.166 $0.388 0.644 0.429 9.844 $0.254 $0.592 20.390 13.593 6.644 $0.166 $0.388 34.690 23.126 6.933 $0.177 $0.412 AUTO Free / Expressways 27.250 AUTO Principal Arterials 20.138  BOSTON, MA  PHILADELPHIA, PA-NJ  WASHINGTON, DC-MD-VA  SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND, CA  CHICAGO, IL NORTHWESTERN, IN LOS ANGELES, CA  NEW YORK, NY NORTHEASTERN, NJ NATION WIDE ESTIMATES  Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak Passenger Miles per Day Passenger Miles per Day Average Trip Length Operating Expense per P Peak Off-Peak  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  0.473 0.316 2.717 $0.396 $0.924 0.785 0.524 3.033 $0.378 $0.882 0.812 0.542 3.448 $0.384 $0.896 1.331 0.888 2.955 $0.351 $0.820 1.558 1.038 2.901 $0.370 $0.862 3.018 2.012 3.788 $0.275 $0.641 6.164 4.109 3.817 $0.328 $0.766 28.763 19.175 3.805 $0.324 $0.757  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  29.425  26.988  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  41.675  24.113  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  53.206  17.556  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  58.500  50.375  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  146.150  106.625  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  118.444  73.263  - Peak - Off Peak assenger Mile  1,277.720  802.400  Source:  The 1997 National Transit Database, Federal Transit Administration; The 1999 Annual Mobility Report, Texas Transportation Institute.  51   References Button, Kenneth.

Econometric Analysis of Transit and Agglomeration Introduction This chapter provides an econometric investigation Its purpose is dual: first, it assesses the relevance of between transit presence, agglomeration economies relationship between transit presence and economic about transit and agglomeration economies. the hypothesis of a positive relationship and productivity; second it investigates the growth in metropolitan areas.  The report is organized as follows. The next section introduces a detailed methodology to test the two hypothesized relationships described above. This is followed by the data used in the analysis and then the empirical results with an interpretation. Figure 5.1 below summarizes the methodological framework developed by HLB.  Survey of the Literature  Agglomeration Economies  Transit and Agglomeration Economies  Agglomeration Economies and Urban Efficiency  Data on Urban Productivity, Agglomeration and Transit Presence  Hypothesized Relationship between Transit, Agglomeration and Urban Efficiency  Test on the Coefficient of the Transit Variable Predefined process  Study Element  Data  Results and Policy Implications  Output  Figure 5.1  Overview of the Methodology   Methodological Framework Here we introduce a framework to test the contribution of transit to urban efficiency and economic growth. The first hypothesis under examination is that the presence of an extended and well-functioning mass transit system promotes the realization of agglomeration economies and thereby stimulates economic efficiency (measured by labor productivity) in large urban areas. This relationship is expressed in a convenient analytical form below. The second hypothesis is that transit presence stimulates economic growth. Testing this hypothesis is the object of the succeeding section. Testing the Relationship between Transit and Productivity A simple functional form for the first hypothesis under examination is introduced to explain how the actual test has been implemented, drawing heavily from empirical studies in the economic literature. The framework presented here is an extension of existing models, where the presence of transit is explicitly accounted for. A Testable Hypothesis for the Role of Transit The null hypothesis under analysis can be summarized as follows: ""Transit provides no measurable benefit to regional economic productivity."" To test this hypothesis, one needs to control for the impact of other variables: multiple regression is the most appropriate framework in this case. HLB proposes to estimate the following relationship from a cross-section of U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA): Yi = a + b1 X1i + b2 X2i + b2 X3i + ... + bn Xni (1)  Where Yi is a measure of productivity in region i (e.g. output per employee, per capita income): X1i is a measure of agglomeration in region i (e.g. population, density); X2i is a measure of transit presence in region i, expressed in either a dichotomous form based on a threshold of service, or expressed in terms of normalized continuous output measure, such as transit employees per capita, revenue miles of service per capita, etc.; Xji, j = 3...k are other control variables (e.g. region size, location dummies, industrial composition, capital endowment, labor force quality, etc.) Productivity could be measured for a specific industry or for the whole economy of the region. Industry-level data would allow testing for the extent of localization economies whereas economy-wide data would allow testing for urbanization economies. Evaluating the Coefficient on the Transit Variable Testing the null hypothesis ""Transit provides no measurable benefit to regional economic productivity"" implies the following set of equations: H0: b2 = 0 54  (2)   HA:  b2  0  (3)  The statistic for the test is the t-statistic associated with the coefficient on the transit variable X2. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows a t-distribution with (n-k) degrees of freedom, where n is the number of observations used in the regression and k the number of explanatory variables. If the calculated statistic departs significantly from its theoretical counterpart, i.e. from the value read in the t-table, the null hypothesis is unlikely to be ""true"". It can be rejected. Rejection of the null hypothesis would indicate that transit does indeed contribute to urban efficiency. On the other hand, if the calculated statistics lies within a reasonable interval form the tabulated value, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Failure to reject the null hypothesis would indicate that (i) transit does not contribute to urban efficiency; or (ii) transit does contribute to urban efficiency but this effect is not captured by the data at hand. Comparing Two Regressions The previous section offers a framework to test the impact of transit on productivity holding everything else constant, i.e. independently from any agglomeration effect (this effect being captured by the variable X1). A slightly different hypothesis can also be tested: does transit affect the magnitude of agglomeration economies and, thereby, indirectly promote urban efficiency? Two methods can be used to test this new hypothesis: a Chow test (or test for structural break) and the introduction of a dummy and a slope dummy variable into the estimating equation. In a Chow test, the initial sample is divided into two sub-samples. Then, separate regressions (one for each sub-sample) are run. The Chow test determines whether the quality of the fit is significantly improved by splitting the sample. It allows determining whether the individuals in one sub-sample (the MSA in the present case) are structurally different from the individuals in the other sub-sample. Conducting a Chow test will allow to test whether MSAs with low transit presence are structurally different (with respect to the factors influencing productivity) from MSAs with extended transit presence. The alternative approach consists of introducing a dummy and slope dummy variable in the model to test for a potential interaction between transit presence and agglomeration. If the slope dummy (transit presence dummy times measure of agglomeration) is found positive and significant, this will imply that the impact of agglomeration on productivity is stronger in areas with more extended transit presence.16  Testing the Relationship between Transit and Economic Growth HLB proposes to test the hypothesis that transit affects economic growth in metropolitan areas by estimating the following equation:  16  As long as the transit dummy is 1 for areas with relatively more transit of course.  55   Yi = a + b1 X1i + b2 X2i + b2 X3i + ... + bn Xni Where: Yi is a measure of economic growth in region i between two given years; X1i is a measure of productivity in region i in the initial year (e.g. output per employee, per capita income);  (4)  X2i is a measure of agglomeration in region i in the initial year (e.g. population, density); X3i is a measure of transit presence in region i in the initial year, expressed in either a dichotomous form based on a threshold of service, or expressed in terms of normalized continuous output measure, such as transit employees per capita, revenue miles of service per capita, etc.; Xji, j = 4...k are other control variables (e.g. region size, location dummies, industrial composition, capital endowment, labor force quality, etc.) Again, the t-test will serve as a benchmark to reject (or fail to reject) the null hypothesis.  Data Description Now for a brief description of the data used in the study (additional descriptive statistics are provided in Annex 5.1 through Annex 5.6). First, we focus on data collection, followed by an explanation of how to populate the productivity model and the growth model. Data Sources Most series in the database were bought from the Minnesota IMPLAN group. Information on transit presence was also provided by the National Transit Database. The Minnesota IMPLAN Group The Minnesota IMPLAN Group is a private firm developing software and data sets for use in economic modeling and marketing analysis. Typically, data sets provide information about 528 industrial sectors (generally 3 or 4 digit SIC code) for all states, counties and MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Areas) in the United States. The data were collected in 1996 (most recent available data) and in 1991 to see the impact over time of the presence of transit. Only the 100 densest MSA have been selected in the sample because they are more likely to feature well developed transit systems. The IMPLAN data set used in the report consists of the following five main components and their respective sub-components: 1. General information Population Land area (square miles) Density (population/area)  56   2. Employment (annual average number of jobs) 3. Industry output ($ millions) 4. Value added ($ millions) Employee compensation (wages and benefits) Proprietary income (self-employment income) Other property type income (corporate, rental income, interest income) Indirect business taxes (payments to Government other than end of year income taxes) 5. Final demands ($ millions) State & local government education purchases (expenditures for Public education) Gross private capital formation (purchases of capital goods and services) In order to measure the presence of transit in terms of Value added or Employment, the following sectors are aggregated:   (433) Railroads and related services: ""establishments furnishing transportation by linehaul railroad (interurban railways), and switching and terminal establishments."" (434) Local, Interurban Passenger Transit: ""establishments primarily engaged in furnishing local and suburban passenger transportation, such as those providing passenger transportation within a single municipality, contiguous municipalities, or a municipality and its suburban areas, by bus (intercity bus lines), rail, or subway, either separately or in combination, and establishments engaged in furnishing transportation to local scenic features. Also included are establishments primarily engaged in furnishing highway passenger terminal or maintenance facilities."" (510) Local Government Passenger Transit: portion of Local, Interurban Passenger Transit owned by State and Local Government.    The National Transit Database Transit presence can also be measured by the number of vehicles (typically, buses and trains) directly operated in maximum service in each transit agency. The service that is provided by a transit agency is considered directly operated when the agency is responsible for generating the service to the public. These data are available online at the National Transit Library.17 They are part of the annual report on National Transit Summaries and Trends. Since an MSA usually has more than one agency, the data are aggregated at the MSA level when necessary. Data Selection and Model Specification From this data set, HLB proposes to define the dependent variable and the explanatory variables of each model as follows: 17  http://www.fta.dot.gov/ntl/database.html  57   Productivity model:   Dependent variable (1996) Productivity = Value added / Employment Independent variables (1996) Presence of transit = Number of vehicles directly operated in maximum service in transit agencies; alternatively, Transit employment; Agglomeration = Other variables = Population; Gross private capital formation (investment);  State and local education purchases (labor force quality); Economic region dummies;18 Industrial composition.19 Growth model:   Dependent variable (1991-1996) Economic growth = Productivity = Percentage change in value added between 1991 and 1996. Value added / Employment Independent variables (1991) Presence of transit = Number of vehicles directly operated in maximum service in transit agencies (1996); alternatively, Transit employment; Agglomeration = Other variables = Population; Gross private capital formation (investment);  State and local education purchases (labor force quality); Economic region dummies; Industrial composition. In Figure 5.2, the dependent variable of the productivity model (value added per employee) is related to a measure of transit presence (the number of vehicles directly operated in maximum 18  The regions used in this study are those defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: Region I  Boston; Region II  New York; Region III  Philadelphia; Region IV  Atlanta; Region V- Chicago; Region VI  Dallas; Region VII  Kansas City; Region VIII  Middle West; Region IX  San Francisco; Region X  Upper Northwest. Ten major sectors (SIC) were considered: Agriculture, forestry and fishing; Mining; Construction; Manufacturing; Transportation and public utilities: Wholesale trade; Retail trade; Finance, insurance, and real estate; Services; Public administration. A subcategory of Transportation was created for Transit (Railroads and related services; Local, interurban passenger transit; and Local government passenger transit).  19  58   service in transit agencies). The scatter diagram clearly shows a positive relationship between the two variables: higher levels of transit presence are associated with higher levels of productivity. 80 , 0 0 0  70 , 0 0 0 P r o d uc t iv ity ( U S $)  60 , 0 0 0  R e gr e s s io n l i ne  50 , 0 0 0  40 , 0 0 0  30 , 0 0 0 0. 000 0  0. 000 2  0. 000 4  0. 000 6  0. 000 8  V e hi cl es d ir e c t l y o p e r a t e d p e r c a p it a  Figure 5.2  Productivity and Transit Presence  Empirical Results and Interpretation Here we report the results of estimating the productivity model and the growth model developed by HLB. First is a summary of various descriptive statistics. Second, the results of testing the role of transit on productivity. Third, the influence of transit on economic growth. Some Descriptive Statistics The sample used to estimate the productivity model is described through basic descriptive statistics in Table 5.1 below.20  20  Since the number of vehicles directly operated (VDO) is missing in 9 M.S.A., the VDO per capita series is completed as follows: the series is sorted by transit employment per capita, then the average of the four VDO per capita values surrounding each M.S.A. is computed.  59   Table 5.1 Variable Name  Descriptive Statistics (1996 Data) Average Std Dev Minimum Value 116,176 MS A Bloomington, IN Oklahoma City, OK Muncie, IN Value 20,175,070 Maximum MS A NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint, MI Lansing-East Lansing, MI NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island  Population  1,713,308  2,851,489  Density  465.36  267.26  241.71  1761.25  Employment Value added ($ millions) Value added per capita Productivity GPCF ($ millions) GPCF per capita State and local education purchases ($ millions) State and local education purchases per capita Number of vehicles directly operated VDO per capita  1,012,453  1,586,142  68,471  10,931,743  55,872.6  102,144.5  2,663.5  Muncie, IN McAllenEdinburgMission, TX McAllenEdinburgMission, TX Muncie, IN BrownsvilleHarlingen-San Benito, TX  770,660  29,180  5,921  11,371  49,111  48,385  6,351  32,415  70,497  7,849  12,550  337  76,814  4,528  2,332  1,192  15,930  2,987  5,101  170  Altoona, PA  40,694  1,838  711  949  SarasotaBradenton, FL Fort PiercePort St. Lucie, FL GreenvilleSpartanburgAnderson, SC McAllenEdinburgMission, TX  6,500  Bloomington, IN NYC-Northern New JerseyLong Island SeattleTacomaBremerton, WA Altoona, PA  521  1,427  15  12,374  Transit  0.000198  0.000134  0.00004  0.000729  Transit employment per capita  0.003627  0.002669  0.000505  0.016591  Obviously, the New York  Northern New Jersey  Long Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is predominant. Of course, one can expect this MSA to be far ahead of the others in 60   Employment and Value Added because of its mere size. However, it also ranks in first position in several per capita series, such as Productivity, reflecting its economic dynamism. Compared to 1991, the situation remains broadly unchanged (see Annex 3).  Transit and Productivity Below, the productivity model is estimated with 1996 data. Various tests are performed to determine whether (more) transit contributes to urban efficiency. Regression Results The model has been run using the OLS method with different functional forms (semi-log, double-log) and explanatory variables (population or density; number of vehicles directly operated or transit employment).

However, all remaining explanatory variables have a significant coefficient at the 5 percent level and their respective standard errors are low, which implies the absence of multicollinearity. The only noticeable exception is the variable for Labor force quality LEDUEXPPC. Quite unexpectedly, its coefficient estimate is negative. State and local education purchases may not be the appropriate measure for this variable. As a consequence, it is dropped further in the analysis. Since we are using a log-log model the slope coefficient b2 measures the constant elasticity of Productivity with respect to the number of Vehicles directly operated per capita (VDOPC). For instance, a 10 percent change in VDOPC will result in a 0.4 percent change in Productivity (see Table 5.3). As expected, b2 is positive and its t-statistic (2.58) is significant therefore the null hypothesis can be rejected. The R-squared, measuring the goodness of fit, is rather satisfactory: its value of 0.721408 means that about 72 percent of the total variation in Productivity across the MSA is explained by variations in the explanatory variables. The main conclusion to draw from these results is that the contribution of transit to urban efficiency, though small, is proved. Using Transit employment per capita (EMPTRAPC) as the measure for transit presence, instead of VDOPC, leads to very similar results (b2 has a value of 0.036971 and it is significant at the 5% level, see Appendix 4) and thus confirms this interpretation. Chow Test Results In addition to the efficiency effect, transit may also add weight to the agglomeration effect generated by Population in the regression. To address this issue, a Chow test is performed. First of all, the original sample is divided into two sub-samples: the first sub-sample consists of the MSA with VDOPC above the median level  62   of employment, and the second sub-sample consists of the MSA with VDOPC below the median. Then, separate regressions are run.21 Table 5.3 Change in Transit Presence and Change in Productivity Effect on Productivity 0.04% 0.40% 1.00% Margin of Error  0.02% 0.15% 0.38% Change in Transit Presence Transit presence vs. no transit 10% Increase in Transit presence 25% Increase in Transit presence  To test for a structural change in the productivity model, the F-statistic is computed in the following way: (0.518648 - (0.202401 + 0.252883) / 11 F[11, 78] =  = 0.98687 (0.202401 + 0.252883) / (50 + 50  22) Table 5.4 Summary Statistics for the Restricted and Unrestricted Regressions Restricted Equation C LPOP LVDOPC LGPCFPC AGG_SER Std. error of the regression Sum of squared residuals 9.559663 0.082592 0.033416 0.067053 -0.009400 0.076338 0.518648 Unrestricted Equation Unrestricted Equation (High Transit) (Low Transit) 9.741423 0.085194 0.023770 0.033706 -0.010298 0.072040 0.202401 10.03547 0.066193 0.073967 0.078435 -0.009909 0.080524 0.252883  Since the critical value for an F statistic with 11 and 78 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.90 (at the usual 5 percent risk level), the null hypothesis according to which the sub-samples are not structurally different cannot be rejected. In other words, the Chow test does not seem to support the hypothesis that areas with larger transit presence are structurally different from areas with lower transit presence.  21  There is no MSA in Regions 8 and 10 for the Low Transit presence equation. Therefore their respective dummy variables are removed from all regressions.  63   Slope Dummy Regression Results However, the Chow test applies to the entire model. Another way to test for the null hypothesis is to focus on the agglomeration variable only and insert a dummy and a slope dummy variable into the regression to measure the increase in the agglomeration effect due to transit. Table 5.5 C LPOP LGPCFPC R1 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 AGG_SER D_VDO D_VDO*LPOP R-Squared Adjusted R-Squared Standard Error of Regression Where: D_VDO = dummy variable for Transit presence, with a value of 1 when Transit presence is above the median and zero otherwise. D_VDO*LPOP = slope dummy variable to account for the combined agglomeration effect of Population and Transit presence. The results show that the total agglomeration effect in MSA with high transit presence is stronger (0.067583 + 0.040483 = 0.108066) than in MSA with low transit presence (0.067583 only). Thus, they validate the hypothesis that transit strengthens the effect of agglomeration on urban efficiency. 64  Regression Results with a Dummy and Slope Dummy Variable Variable Name Coefficient 9.725277 0.067583 0.047101 -0.033181 -0.038853 -0.071501 -0.135559 -0.121286 -0.072653 -0.139697 -0.003618 -0.105723 -0.010938 -0.551886 0.040483 0.727508 0.677313 0.073349 t-Statistic 33.52478 3.679613 1.991721 -0.615634 -0.952268 -1.841619 -3.332609 -2.935082 -1.548613 -2.233720 -0.076052 -1.689656 -3.814205 -1.702329 1.699805 Sum of Squared Residuals F-Statistic Probability (F-Statistic) Probability Value 0.0000 0.0004 0.0500 0.5400 0.3440 0.0694 0.0013 0.0044 0.1256 0.0284 0.9396 0.0952 0.0003 0.0928 0.0933 0.408883 14.49340 0.000000   Transit and Economic Growth The purpose of this section is to show that there exists a positive relationship between transit presence and economic growth. It is commonly accepted that productivity is one of the main factors of growth along with investment and education. The findings of the study indicate that, indirectly, transit is contributing to economic activity via productivity. But, does transit stimulate growth independently from its effect on productivity? The equation to be estimated differs from the initial one in the dependent variable: value added growth, as a measure of economic growth, replaces productivity, which becomes a new explanatory variable. All the other explanatory variables remain the same but they are observed in 1991. The model can be written as follows: Log (Value added growth) = b0 + b1 Log (Productivity) + b2 Log (Population) + b3 Log (Transit Presence) + b4 Log (GPCFPC) + b5 Location Dummies + b6 Services + u 4.1+ The dependent variable represents the increase in value added in each MSA from 1991 to 1996. Since the data for VDOPC were not available in 1991, this variable was replaced by LEMPTRAPC, measured employment in the transit sectors. The testing procedure is based again on the null hypothesis that the coefficient on the transit variable, b2, is equal to zero: H0: b2 = 0 vs. HA: b2  0  As shown in Table 5.6, the model explains about 43% of the variations in growth rate across MSAs. The F-statistic and the associated probability indicate the model's coefficients are jointly different from zero. Contrary to the previous regressions, the coefficient estimates on Location dummies are positive and are all significant at the 5 percent level. In the same way, b2 is positive and significantly different from zero. The coefficient estimate implies that the presence of transit does contribute to economic growth. However, the coefficient on Productivity is quite unexpectedly negative.  65   Table 5.6  Transit and Economic Growth  Regression Results Using Employment in the Transit Sector as a Measure of Transit Presence (1991 and 1996 Data) Variable Name C LPDTY LPOP LEMPTRAPC LGPCFP R1 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 AGG_SER R-Squared Adjusted RSquared Standard Error of Regression Coefficient 16.62411 -1.486048 0.157273 0.102318 0.149067 0.434140 0.499105 0.658507 0.428978 0.562827 0.523175 0.785211 0.484474 0.675694 -0.027453 0.430256 0.336416 0.289141 t-Statistic 4.499072 -3.544343 3.604159 1.906883 1.153178 2.398879 3.013435 3.898174 2.642363 3.360149 2.835229 3.114393 2.810975 2.613021 -2.898315 Sum of Squared Residuals F-Statistic Probability (FStatistic) Probability Value 0.0000 0.0006 0.0005 0.0599 0.2521 0.0186 0.0034 0.0002 0.0098 0.0012 0.0057 0.0025 0.0061 0.0106 0.0048 7.106199 4.584994 0.000004  Where: LVAGTH, the natural log of Value added growth, is the dependent variable; and LEMPTRAPC is the natural log of Transit employment per capita.  The Economic Impact of Transit Presence It is possible to use the coefficient estimates found in the previous sections to evaluate the average impacts of the presence of transit on productivity and economic growth. Table 5.7 and Table 5.8 summarize the results of this benefits analysis. These numbers are reliable considering the high significance of the coefficient on the Transit variable. Moreover, similar calculations based on other estimates of transit presence lead to the same levels of benefits. 66   The results indicate that, on average, a 25% increase in the presence of transit creates: About $20 million worth of value added through the impact of transit on productivity and; About $18 million worth of value added through the impact of transit on economic growth over a 5-year period. The two tables present benefit estimates for three possible changes in transit presence. Note that a 1% increase in transit presence represents about 5 extra transit vehicles or 62 extra employees in the transit sector in each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) (evaluated at average). Table 5.7 Impact of Transit on Productivity Percentage Change in Productivity + 0.04% + 0.40% + 0.10% Average Productivity Gains per Employee $19 $192 $480 Total Productivity Gains per M.S.A $19.4 million $194.3 million $485.9 million Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  Given the data at hand, the coefficient estimate of the transit variable in the growth model measures the impact of transit presence over a 5-year period. The annual impact of transit presence was derived by dividing the 5-year impact by 5. Table 5.8 Impact of Transit on Economic Growth Added Economic Growth (5-year) + 0.10% + 1.02% + 2.56% 5-year Growth Effect per 1-year Growth Effect per MSA MSA $18.0 million $180.3 million $450.8 million $3.6 million $36.1 million $90.2 million Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  Using the above results, the estimated aggregate effect by multiplying the value added per worker with the number of workers, about 127 million workers. Table 5.9 shows the aggregate effect of transit in the United States for a total of 276 MSAs. Table 5.9 Aggregate Impact of Transit in the United States Value Created Yearly due to Productivity Gains $2.4 billion $24.3 billion $60.9 billion Value Created Yearly Total Annual Economic Benefits due to Added Economic Growth $0.5 billion $5.3 billion $13.2 billion $3 billion $30 billion $75 billion Change in Transit Presence + 1% + 10% + 25%  67   Conclusions This chapter reports on an investigation on the influence of transit on the economic performance of large metropolitan areas. Econometric evidence has provided support to the idea of a positive impact of transit on productivity and economic growth: the hypotheses under consideration have been supported by various testing procedures. This conclusion has been reached under different model specifications. For instance, measuring transit presence by the number of employees in the transit sectors or by the number of operated vehicles has changed neither the direction nor the significance of the results. The results provided in this paper are also consistent with the findings of previous studies of agglomeration economies (see Henderson, 1988 for example).  68   Annex 5.1  Economic and Demographic Characteristics of the Sampled MSA (1996 Data) PRODUCTIVITY ($) 49,246 52,851 41,105 45,108 56,318 48,662 43,411 44,371 42,683 51,351 36,304 56,114 33,087 49,073 42,879 49,972 53,503 45,965 59,848 50,307 50,095 42,474 46,661 49,621 59,591 47,301 37,522 52,947 46,525 57,730 40,313 46,853 43,807 51,873 43,954 V.

Commercial Property Benefits of Transit Introduction This Chapter reports on Commercial Property Benefits of Transit. The goal was ""to research and develop a practical methodology for estimating the effect of the proximity of transit on commercial property value."" Therefore, the objective of this report is to present a detailed review of the literature focusing on methodological issues, to propose a methodology that allows the estimation of the impact of transit on commercial property and to describe the implementation of this methodology on a selected set of data. Methodological Framework Two approaches have been used in the literature to address similar issues: regional scale analyses and property level analyses22. The former focuses on the changes in commercial property values brought about by a change in the transit system (the opening of a new bus line for example) for a particular region; the latter concentrates on the differential impact that public transit has on surrounding properties. This Chapter used the latter approach to estimate the effect of the proximity to transit on commercial properties. The best technique to evaluate this impact consists of estimating a hedonic price model, where the value of selected commercial properties would be regressed on a set of property characteristics. To run these regressions, FTA collected three types of data: real estate, geographical and socioeconomic data. The estimated coefficients of the hedonic price equation were then used to evaluate the impact of transit on commercial property value within the area of study. This impact was then expressed as a dollar increment in property value per foot of proximity to transit. It was then a straightforward task to evaluate the average and the total impact of transit within the area of study. Figure 6.1 illustrates the methodology. After this introduction, the next section presents a review of the literature. This review starts with general considerations about the benefits of transit in increasingly congested urban areas. The nature of commercial property benefits provided by transit is explored. Next, two measurement methods are described that have been commonly used in the literature: hedonic pricing and stated preference methods. Then we discuss more closely the implementation of hedonic models, concentrating on the choice of explanatory variables in existing studies of commercial property values. We will then describe the actual methodology. After an overview of the task, some methodological issues are considered: which type of commercial properties should be included in the analysis? What is the appropriate area of study? Do different forms of public transportation have different impacts on property values? Finally, How should the properties be selected? This discussion then specifies the model; it addresses the choice of the appropriate functional form and the selection of the variables entering the model. The chapter concludes with the empirical implementation of the model, describes the data used in the study and provides estimates of the  22  Alex Anas and Regina Armstrong, ""Land Values and Transit Access: Modeling the relationship in the New-York Metropolitan Area"", Federal Transit Administration, Final Report, September 1993.   impact of transit on commercial properties.

Environmentalists are concerned with the dangerous levels of air pollutants in many cities. The inefficiencies and costs of traffic congestion and the burden it places on the regional economies worry the economists. The reliance on primarily imported oil concerns planners and policy-makers alike. Commuters, who experience the regular extended traffic congestion, complain about the associated stress and unpleasantness. In recent years, residents in hundreds of U.S. suburbs have come to regard traffic congestion as their most serious environmental problem. The statistics suggest that congestion is rising primarily in metropolitan areas that are either very large -those with a population of two million or more- or fast growing. Most strikingly, for a given area, traffic on highways can grow even faster than population and employment (that was the case, for example, for Montgomery County, Maryland, in the 1978-1988 period; see Downs (1992)). The same pattern has been observed also in national highway travel data over recent decades. The causes of rising congestion can be divided into two basic categories: immediate and long term. At least four immediate causes can be mentioned: rapid population and job growth, more intensive use of automotive vehicles, failure to build new roads, failure to make drivers bear the full costs they generate. Long term, or indirect, causes include: concentration of work trips in time, desire to choose where to live and work, desire for low-density neighborhoods, preference for low-density workplaces, and desire to travel in private vehicles.23 Traffic congestion problems as well as the solutions to these problems may vary from one city to another. The next section describes the three types of city that have been identified in the literature: monocentric, polycentric and edge cities. We then introduce transit as a way to solve or at least reduce - congestion problems. Monocentric, Polycentric, and Edge City Models The models of residential location in urban land markets originally developed by Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) have long since established themselves as the foundations of urban economic theory. The fundamental results of the basic model are that the spatial distribution of land and housing prices, consumption of land (and other housing attributes), and the spatial arrangement of residents are determined by the transportation costs to the Central Business District (CBD). In particular, the principal qualitative hypotheses which the standard model generates are: (1) the price of land declines with distance from the CBD (the negative rent or land price gradient); and (2) the consumption of land per household increases with distance from the CBD (the negative density gradient). The obvious fact that only a small portion of metropolitan area jobs are found in the CBD does not necessarily undermine the predictions of a model that assumes that all jobs are located in the CBD24. Even if the fraction of CBD jobs is small, money wages would have to fall with distance from the CBD to compensate workers for longer commutes and to attract them 23 24  Downs (1992) Richardson, Harry W. (1988)  83   from locally available jobs. Richardson (1988) also points out that the predicted negative gradients are actually observed (in house prices, land rents, output of housing services per unit land, population densities), and their relative rates of change are plausible and internally consistent. In the homogeneous income case, the essential condition of the standard monocentric model is that the marginal decline in housing expenditures with outward movement should exactly compensate the marginal increase in commuting costs so that households are indifferent among locations. Coulson (1991) tests the monocentric model in the framework of a hedonic model, where the selling price of a house is regarded as a function of housing attributes, including distance to the CBD. The empirical results show that housing prices fall at a rate approximately equal to the increase in transportation costs, as predicted by the model. However, most metropolitan areas are not monocentric: they have subcenters where a substantial amount of employment is located. These subcenters are usually a result of decentralization and urban sprawl. Each of them may have rent gradients of their own, which will collide with the CBD's gradient, and with each other's. Thus, while the monocentric model can be relevant within each submarket, it will appear irrelevant for these metropolitan areas as a whole. Both the huge proportion of non-CBD employment and the continued strength of agglomeration economies (as economies of spatial concentration, not centralization) imply the presence of these employment subcenters that pull in workers from their immediate locale (Richardson (1988)). Muth (1985) argues that the existence of substantial non-CBD employment also explains why central vs. suburban income differentials are much narrower than those predicted by the standard monocentric model. In his framework, since local and non-local homogeneous workers have to be offered the same wage, there is no negative wage gradient. Furthermore, the sites close to the subcenter workplace will be at a premium because of the supra-equilibrium wages offered there; in other words, there is no negative land rent gradient either. What is the driving force of the polycentric model? The strength of the CBD relies on the comparison of CBD agglomeration economies with CBD congestion costs, both as a function of city size. As the city becomes very large, the gap between the two functions narrows. By the time the functions intersect, the CBD retains no locational advantage over alternative metropolitan sites. Richardson (1988) points out that there is substantial empirical evidence to support this view. For example, Anjomani and Chimene (1982) test the monocentric density gradient hypothesis with 1950 and 1970 data. They find a significant gradient in 40 out of 46 cities in 1950 but fail to identify such gradient in more than half of the cities in 1970. In another study25, 58 polycentric population density peaks were identified in the five-county Los Angeles area. This study also showed that a polycentric ""density surface"" was more appropriate than the traditional monocentric gradient for the area under examination. Richardson (1988) notes that subcenters can also be identified in terms of: office space, in- and out- commuting, employment, employment density, worker amenities, influence of suburban nodes on housing prices and land values, and significance of a CBD accessibility variable.  25  Gordon, P., Richardson, H., and Wong, H.: The Distribution of Population and Employment in a Policentric City: The Case of Los Angeles, ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING (1986). Cited in Richardson, Harry W. (1988)  84   With respect to commutes, Richardson (1988) mentions several studies suggesting that polycentric spatial structures facilitate commuting economies. In particular, these studies have shown that: (1) residential densities and commuting times are positively associated, which is consistent with the idea that low-density metropolitan areas and their decentralized employment centers facilitate shorter work trips26; (2) people with the shortest commuting times are those who live and work in the suburbs, while the worst-off are those who live in the suburbs but work in the CBD (the typical commuter in monocentric cities); (3) travel speeds do not vary with city size; (4) peak travel speeds improved between 1977 and 1983. This research suggest that firms and households have been relocating and settling close to each other, facilitating shorter trips and relieving core-area congestion. Edge cities provide another perspective on the spatial organization of production in metropolitan areas. Contrary to traditional suburbs, edge cities are not simply bedroom communities or a product of urban decentralization. They are the creation of strategically controlled office development by large-scale land developers. Edge cities are new cities, created since 1965, outside major central or core cities - they are typically based around one of the great American ports (e.g. Boston, Chicago, Houston, New York, and San Francisco) and centered around enormous tracts of mixed-use office space. They are complete cities, offering jobs, residences, shopping facilities and services for their inhabitants. They are planned entities with rules and limits to their growth. Edge city developers make strategic choices in terms of office space capacity, location vis--vis the central city and other edge cities, industry- and job-mix. Their location and capacity choices are strategic because they engage the passive core city and potential competitors in a struggle for the metro area resources. To illustrate this, Henderson and Mitra (1996), present a decision model for an edge city developer who chooses business district capacity and location with a view to maximize profits. Moving closer to the core city enhances production efficiency by increasing the efficiency of the exchange of information between businesses in the core and edge city. On the other hand, it increases typical residential rents and commuting costs (and hence wages demanded by employees) and weakens the developer's local monopsony power. Assessing Transit-Oriented Solutions Given the increasing problems associated with automobile dependence, many planners, policymakers and others are examining potential alternatives to decrease the reliance on automobile travel. Transit-oriented development for residential and mixed-used areas offers one possible solution. Public transit can be expanded through bus, fixed-rail, or light rail systems. Fixed-rail services of all types are feasible only if they converge on relatively large downtown areas. On the other hand, light rail lines cost less to build than full-scale fixed-rail systems with underground segments through downtown areas. However, aside from a few large cities with extensive mass transit systems, public transit is not widely used for work trips. Public transit usage is even lower among workers living in suburbs. According to Downs (1992), it appears that persons most likely to use public transit for work trips are those who (1) have no automotive vehicle available to their household, (2) live in a central city and work in its CBD, and (3) live in a densely settled community. However, in generating transit usage, the residential density of an 26  Downs (1992)  85   area is less significant than its location. The study also shows that the density of nonresidential clusters is much more important in generating public transportation usage than residential density, other things equal. Among the public policies that can be implemented in order to increase public transit ridership we can mention: (1) cutting transit or bus fares, (2) cutting transit or bus running time, (3) cutting transit or bus waiting time by increasing service frequency. Downs (1992) also discusses whether greater use of public transit would be achieved by concentrating more jobs in large clusters outside the CBD. In metropolitan areas dominated by geographically large local governments, such as the county governments around Washington, D.C., additional jobs could be steered into a few major centers. This would convert now sprawling but inefficient offices in these centers into more compact, downtown-like districts and -if these centers were served by rapid transit- would encourage more commuting off the highways. The Nature of Commercial Property Benefits from Transit The urban economics literature has early on established that access to transit, as a positive amenity, will be ""capitalized"" in the value of land and residential - or commercial - property. It is the purpose of this section to explain why the proximity of transit may enhance commercial property value. It turns out that the nature of these benefits is dual: the proximity of transit may not only facilitate the access to customers but also the access to the work force. Before turning to these issues, it is necessary to introduce two important benefit concepts: present value and willingness-to-pay. Benefit Concepts The market value of land equals the present value of the stream of rental income generated by the land. The present value is the maximum amount that an investor is willing to pay for an asset, given an alternative investment. In other words, the market value of land is the present value of the annual rental payments from the land. In contrast with agricultural land, which can deteriorate with use, developed land does not deteriorate. Therefore, the market value of developed land equals the annual rent divided by the interest rate27. This concept can be extended to commercial property value. Income from Commercial Property and Willingness-to-Pay The maximum price a firm is willing to pay for any site is a function of its anticipated future returns when operating at the site28. The annual return can be thought of as the excess of total annual revenue over total annual costs, for all factors of production other than land. It follows that changes in the value of a commercial property (a stock measure) will represent the discounted anticipated changes in the income revenue from the property (a flow measure). In this context, a bid-rent function can be defined. This function indicates how much a firm is willing to pay for different office sites. Assuming perfectly competitive markets, economic profit will be 27  O'Sullivan, Arthur: Urban Economics (1996)  28  Downing, Paul B.: Factors Affecting Commercial Land Values: An Empirical Study of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, LAND ECONOMICS, 49:1, Feb. 1973  86   zero in equilibrium and the amount paid by the firm will equal the excess of total revenue over non-land costs.29 From all that, commercial property value will be affected by the proximity of transit as long as transit affects anticipated future revenues or total costs. Access to Labor Supply The impact of transportation changes on labor markets can be quite extensive and can occur at a number of different levels. In a study about labor markets and high-speed trains, Haynes (1997) divides this impact into supply-side and demand-side effects. On the supply side, transportation affects both the micro level search behavior of job seekers and the meso level tradeoffs between commuting and labor migration. Specifically, the latter implies that transportation improvements that lower the cost of migration increase certainty by reducing information decay (i.e. the decline in information about job availability produced by distance) or search costs, lower the cost of labor market adjustments, and increase the efficiency of labor migration. On the demand side, firms that demand labor will have a broader pool to select from at lower prices (as they will have to pay a lower wage premium for extra commuting) with the potential for a more targeted or specialized fit between jobs and employees. White (1988) examines workers' commuting behavior in an urban model with decentralized employment. This behavior will in turn influence firms in their location choice. The paper shows that in cities with decentralized employment, a ""commuting indifference"" property holds, but only in special cases. In general, households' rent offer curves for housing depend on their workers' job locations. It is also shown that workers' wage offer curves for different job locations vary with their households' residential locations. Specifically, workers having different job locations may segregate into different residential rings. The paper shows a pattern in which workers living in particular residential rings have preferences over where they work. In equilibrium, it is likely that workers' residential and job locations will be non-negatively related to each other. If we consider the case of workers with different skills, the model predicts that firms have stronger incentives to suburbanize as the average skill level and wage rate of their workers rise. Therefore, the composition of a firm's workforce (i.e. the relative mix of high-wage versus low-wage workers) influences the firm's location. And there is no generalized indifference property applying to commuting journey lengths in cities with decentralized employment. Rotemberg and Saloner (1990) argue that firms locate together to commit to compete for labor and not pay monopsony wages. This effective commitment enables firms to attract labor in the first place. Haynes (1997) explores the impact of high-speed train on labor markets for three cases: Japan's Shinkansen, France's TGV, and Germany's ICE. In Japan, station locations generated higher population growth levels when an information exchange industry (business services, banking and real estate development), universities and expressway access were also present. In general, the empirical studies indicate that transportation improvements taken together are often 29  O'Sullivan: op.cit.  87   complementary. Station effects and expressway effects also contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income. On the other hand, a heavy concentration in manufacturing industry and an aged population were growth limiting variables. Access to Consumers Stores and personal businesses will seek to locate close to where potential customers can access their services. First, the accessibility of a site for potential customers will directly affect anticipated future net returns. Second, the knowledge potential customers can have on the firm's location and existence is also likely to affect expected revenues (see Downing (1973)). Glaeser et al. (1992) observe the presence of ""urbanization"" externalities: different industries locate in a city because local demand is high there, and so they can sell some of their output without incurring transport costs. In the same spirit, Krugman (1991) presents a model of city formation based on local demand. The evidence presented in Glaeser et al. (1992) strongly supports the urbanization externalities hypothesis. Additionally, Moses and Williamson (1967) show that firm size must be taken into account when analyzing location patterns, since small firms may be more constrained regarding this issue. In other words, larger firms can move longer distances because they are more independent of suppliers or buyers at a particular location. Property Value and Access Sivitanidou (1996) explains that ""the contemporary land market theory has early on established that differential firm access to business activity clusters must elicit significant effects on commercial land markets"" (page 126). She stresses in particular ""the importance of forward (clientele-related) and backward (input-related) linkages between firms providing or using such support services as advertising, accounting, financial, business, and legal"" (page 127). Finally, she notes that these linkages ""necessitate frequent travel by top-level executives whose time carries significant opportunity costs"" (page 127). In addressing the role that business centers play within polycentric Los Angeles, Sivitanidou (1995) presents a model that builds upon previous urban spatial studies postulating joint household and firm equilibria. In this model, property value per unit land is a function of both property specific traits and location attributes. Property traits include standard building attributes (age, area per floor, elevator, parking, etc.). Location attributes include business centers (main or secondary) accessibility and a set of control locational traits (local service and transportation access, location prestige, worker amenities, and land supply constraints). Center accessibility is measured as the distance to each center, whereas transportation access is measured as the distance to the closest major airport and freeway. The model also allows for different specifications regarding the relative importance and degree of substitutability of secondary business centers. The empirical findings based on this model not only confirm the hypothesis that firms value main center accessibility, but they also show that secondary center accessibility matters too. Both factors generate nontrivial land market effects. The study also shows that distance to airport exhibits the expected (negative) sign, and is statistically significant. Downs (1992) suggests that public transit usage affects nonresidential density. He notes that Washington D.C.'s Metro rail system appears to have encouraged more downtown development than would otherwise have occurred. Metro rail converges on downtown from all directions, with 88   the result that the city center has become a better labor market for employers. He concludes that one way to strengthen the market for office and other space within a business center is to build more off-road transit facilities to serve it. Downing (1973) presents regressions of land sales prices as a function of distance to CBD, distance to shopping center, traffic level on main street, area population, median income, amenities, and area dummies. He concludes that these variables explain a substantial portion of the variations in commercial land value for the study area (the city of Milwaukee). One hypothesis of the paper is that the distance to the CBD might be associated with the firm's cost of obtaining goods and services. Although it is recognized that travel time to CBD would be a more appropriate variable than distance to CBD, the latter is used; the associated coefficients are significant only when the distance is substantial. Therefore, the empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that greater accessibility to transportation increases land values. Nakamura and Ueda (1989) present empirical evidence of a substantial station driven commercial land value increase for the case of Japan's Shinkansen. This increase is even higher than the expressway driven value increase. For the cases of France's TGV and Germany's ICE, there is also empirical evidence of commercial land value and demand increases due to station effects.  The Measurement of Transit's Impact Hedonic Pricing Methodology Many commodities can be viewed as bundles of individual attributes for which no explicit markets exist. Although it would be of interest to estimate structural supply and demand functions for these attributes, the absence of directly observable attribute prices poses a problem for such estimation. A hedonic price equation is a reduced-form equation reflecting both supply and demand influences. The hedonic regression reveals implicit prices of these attributes, and may provide a starting point for recovering underlying supply and demand functions. Unfortunately, the appropriate functional form for the hedonic price equation cannot in general be specified on theoretical grounds. Downing (1973) does not address the issue explicitly. He uses both linear and non-linear forms to evaluate the impact of the distance to the CBD and the distance to the nearest shopping center on land value. His results are unaffected by the choice of the functional form. However, since the non-linear form is more consistent with traditional theory and was found to substantially improve the fit in the residential land value regressions, non-linear form results are generally reported in the literature. Grass (1992) uses a semi-log form while Sivitanidou (1996) uses a log-linear, or double-log, function. Although some earlier writers30 had employed the Box-Cox model, it is since Halvorsen and Pollakowski's (1981) contribution that this model has become widely employed in hedonic studies. The authors stress that the lack of a firm theoretical basis for the choice of functional form is unfortunate since, in their opinion, the results obtained using the hedonic approach 30  Linneman, P.: Some empirical results on the nature of the hedonic price function for the urban housing market, JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS 8, 1980. Cited in Cheshire and Sheppard (1995)  89   depend critically on the functional form. Therefore, the authors recommend the use of a flexible approach that does not require the specification of a functional form per-se: the Box-Cox model. Graves et al. (1988) address the issues of functional form and error distribution in the context of estimating hedonic prices for urban air quality. The authors point out that the empirical magnitudes of the hedonic prices may vary substantially, depending on how these issues are addressed. In order to make the functional form sufficiently general, they employ the Box-Cox model. They conclude that most of the functional forms encountered in the environmental literature can be rejected for their data set. However, they cannot assess the relative impact of functional form variations on hedonic price estimates. In fact, if the estimated prices are relatively insensitive to functional form, the commonly used forms may provide relatively precise benefit estimates. Finally, the authors want to evaluate the presence of a bias in parameter estimates derived from the assumption of normality. Their estimates from an alternative, robust estimation technique (minimum absolute deviation) do not differ substantially from least squares estimates. They conclude that least square estimation can be relied on. In the specific case of land value, it is important to distinguish between the hedonic price of land and the amount for which vacant land might sell in the actual market. Theories of the urban land market typically focus on the intrinsic usefulness of land, and on the differential accessibility of land at various locations. The combination of these two forces determines an equilibrium price for land and it is this price that Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) define as the hedonic price of land. In normal circumstances such a price will be less than the observed sales price of vacant land since the latter would include the value of local amenities. In Cheshire and Sheppard's (1995) specification of an hedonic model applied to residential land, they group housing characteristics in dwelling-specific and location-specific. The paper outlines a technique which, under appropriate conditions, can provide estimates of the marginal value of neighborhood characteristics: value that will be capitalized into, and is often confused with, the value of land. By successively adding sets of location-specific characteristics to this model, it is possible econometrically to simulate the capitalization of these characteristics into land values. The results suggest that, if location-specific characteristics of housing are appropriately measured, monocentric models can perform well. Concerning the functional form, the authors point out that their results would justify the choice of the Box-Cox transformation. The hedonic approach to benefit evaluation relies on the cross-sectional capitalization hypothesis which assumes mobility of people between different locations. Property prices are higher in an area with better amenities - or better public services - because otherwise many individuals would want to move into the area and would bid up property prices. Perfect mobility between different areas, therefore, ensures that property prices reflect the benefits of amenities. Kanemoto (1988) points out that the use of hedonic prices in benefit estimation tends to result in over-investment in amenities. More precisely, if the costs and the benefits of a project are evaluated at preimprovement prices, the hedonic measure will overestimate the benefits of the project. However, this result requires the assumption that migration between regions is free and cost-less. If mobility is imperfect, capitalization tends to be less than perfect, which creates a counteracting tendency for underestimation, and the net result is uncertain. Similarly, Bartik (1988) shows that the property value increases due to amenity improvements predicted by an hedonic function will generally be overestimated, thus allowing the ex-ante calculation of an upper bound for the benefits associated with these improvements. If consumer marginal willingness to pay for amenities can be estimated, a lower bound for the benefits can be 90   computed as well. But estimating consumer willingness to pay is difficult and the upper bound will often be the best benefit measure available... Stated Preference Methods An alternative to the hedonic methodology is to directly ask households or individuals to state their willingness to pay for public goods using survey techniques. The survey approach for valuing public goods has received considerable theoretical scrutiny. Randall et al.(1974), Bohm (1972), and Brookshire et al. (1976) modeled the survey approach using standard concepts of consumer surplus; in addition, the latter two analyses also focus on the possibility of strategic behavior. Despite arguments that strategic bias will invalidate survey results, there is the need for an alternative to the hedonic approach, as the latter cannot always be applied. The considerable empirical evidence now available suggests that strategic bias may be of little consequence both in survey work31 and in experimental economics32. The hypothetical nature of the questions used in survey analysis may substantially reduce incentives for strategic behavior. However, respondents may also have little incentive to provide accurate answers concerning willingness to pay for public goods. Thus, it has even been suggested that the survey approach produces ""noise"" since responses are purely hypothetical and have no necessary connection to actual budgetary decisions. The results of using the survey approach for estimating the value of public goods appear to be internally consistent, replicable and consistent with demand theory33. Brookshire et al. (1982) report on an experiment designed to externally validate the survey approach by comparing it to a hedonic property value study. The authors provide a theoretical model that predicts that survey responses will be bounded below by zero and above by rent differentials derived from the estimated hedonic rent gradient. The empirical results do not allow the rejection of either of the 31  see the following articles:  Bishop, R., and Heberlein, T.: Measuring Values of Extra-Market Goods: Are Indirect Measures Biased?, AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, December 1979.

Adapting the Residential Benefits Model to Commercial Property The impact of transit systems on urban property values has been widely studied. Since rapid transit is an important means of travel to the CBD in many cities, Dewees (1976) analyzed the relationship between travel costs by rail and residential property values. He found that replacing a street-car with a subway increased the site rent perpendicular to the facility within a one-third mile walk to the station. Damm et al. (1980) showed that the distance of a parcel to the nearest Metro station was a statistically significant determinant of the transaction price of an urban parcel, while Wolf (1979) similarly showed the positive influence of permanent transportation improvements on parcel values. The methods developed by these authors are applied in Grass (1992). This article analyzes the individual Metro station effects on residential property values, for Washington D.C.. A hedonic price equation is estimated, where the dependent variable is the average property value for each area. The equation includes among its independent variables a dummy for the ""impact area"" (i.e. the area less than one-quarter mile from the station). This study reveals a significant direct relationship between the opening of Metro stations and residential property values.  Implementing Hedonic Models Hedonic price estimation is performed using multiple regression techniques. In the present study, property value would be regressed on a set of explanatory variables including property and location characteristics. This section focuses on the description of the variables that have been previously used in the literature. Variable Selection in the Literature Downing (1973) computes property values in terms of actual purchase price. Sivitanidou (1996) uses assessed property values but mentions that there is a high correlation between assessed and actual market values. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the listed asking price, although they realize that the actual transaction price would be the usual variable to include. Finally, the dependent variable can be expressed in terms of property values per unit - per square foot for example - as opposed to non-normalized property values. Independent variables can be grouped in different ways, but the distinction between location attributes and property-specific traits seems the most fundamental. Additionally, the former may in turn be decomposed into a set of accessibility characteristics and another set of control location traits. FTA compiled a list of explanatory variables used in the literature. This list is summarized in Table 6.1. Note that each class of variables has a reference number (2) to (18). (2) Distance to Central Business District. Moses and Williamson [M&S] (1967) use this variable, as it is inversely correlated with the rent gradient. They find a significant and negative coefficient. According to Downing [D] (1973), this variable is associated with the firm's cost of obtaining goods and services, and also measures access to major transportation links. He uses the straight line distance from the site to the CBD but notes that a more appropriate measure would be the time it takes to travel from the site to the CBD. He finds that this variable is not  92   Table 6.1 (1)  Variable Selection in the Hedonic Measurement Literature Dependent Variable area units Independent Variables Category Variable dCBD dSBD type of street or traffic level dairport dummy bus dummy station or land use rail or dstation [D][G][M&W][S][C&S] [S] Sivitanidou [C&S] Cheshire & Sheppard [D] Downing [S] [C&S] [G] Grass [M&W] Moses & Williamson [M&W] [S] [D] [M&W] [S] [D] [C&S] [D] [C&S] Source See notes on [S], [G] and [C&S] Source Purchase Value of Land [D]  (2) (3) (4) (5) Location Attributes: (6) Accessibility (7)  (8) (9) (10) (11)  dummy freeway or dfreeway Population Population density average income or median income or blue collar or ethnic  (12) Other Location Attributes (13) (14) (15) (16) Property (17) Characteristics (18)  new construction around or [C&S] [G] deteriorated around or [D] prestige %commercial use worker amenities lot size corner building traits [S] [M&W] [C&S] [S] [S] [C&S] [D] [G] [C&S] [D] [G] [C&S] [S] density commercial or [HLB]  land supply constraints [S] [M&W]  93   significant, except for the case of substantial distances. Grass [G] (1992), Cheshire and Sheppard [C&S](1995), and Sivitanidou [S] (1996) also use this variable. In Grass (1992) this variable is not significant. He points out that a possible explanation would be that the spatial pattern of parcels is not smoothly sloping. Sivitanidou (1996) shows that this variable is negative and significant. (3) Distance to Secondary Business District(s). Sivitanidou (1996) provides three alternative specifications of the effect of this variable. Each specification embodies different assumptions on the degree of substitution between the service ""bundles"" offered by the area's centers. This variable is found negative and significant. (4) Type of street. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) divide roads into five categories from cul-desac to main roads. Each type of street (except one) is assigned a dummy variable. Their aim is to reflect the level of both traffic disturbance and pollution to which a site is subject. They also notice that location on larger roads might provide an increased level of accessibility and -in the case of residential property- the possibility of conversion to commercial use. The actual observed effect would be the net outcome of these two effects. Downing (1973) also mentions the possibility of using distance from the main street as a variable. Downing (1973) includes traffic level on the main street, measured in thousands of vehicles per 24 hours. The variable is significant and has the expected (positive) sign. (5) Sivitanidou (1996) includes distance to closest major airport among the variables. This variable is negative and significant. (6) Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use a dummy for bus route near the site but this variable is not significant. (7) Grass (1992) uses a dummy for rail station in the area. This variable is significant and positive. Percentage of land used for transportation other than highway in a given area is included by Moses and Williamson (1967). In their study, this variable is not significant. (8) Dummy for freeway. This variable is one if there is a freeway in a given zone, and zero if there is none. It is used by Moses and Williamson (1967). The variable turns out to be not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) includes distance to closest freeway in the model. Contrary to her expectations, the variable is not significant. (9) Population. Downing (1973) notes that a larger population in the area surrounding the site would increase anticipated sales and thus land values. He runs separate regressions for populations living within different radii. He finds that this variable has the expected (positive) sign, but it is significant only for long radii. (10) Population density in a given zone. This variable is a good measure of the availability of labor, sometimes seen as a surrogate for the wage gradient. It is introduced by Moses and Williamson (1967) but is not significant in their study. (11) Sivitanidou (1996) uses a variable measuring per capita income in the census tract each property is located in. This variable is intended to capture the quality of a property's surrounding  94   neighborhood, and is included among ""worker amenities"". The results show that it is positive and significant. Median income reflects the fact that firms expect to draw most of their customers from the area surrounding the site. Downing (1973) uses this variable; his results show that it is significant, but -contrary to what he expects- negative. Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) include a variable representing the proportion of blue collar within total labor force in a given area; the variable is not significant. Racial/Ethnic factors. Downing (1973) uses the percentage of non-white population in an area to measure the effects of racial diversity. He finds that this variable is significant and negative. In their study on two English cities, Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the percentage of urban Afro-Caribbean population in an area. The variable turns out to be significant but -contrary to what they expected- positive. (12) A dummy variable for new construction (1 if majority of observations in the area are new) is included in Cheshire and Sheppard (1995). This variable is positive and significant for one case (city of Darlington) and not significant for the other (city of Reading). Grass uses the percentage of new houses around the site to account for this factor. The variable is found significant and positive. Downing (1973) uses the percentage of deteriorating or dilapidated units in the block as a measure of visual amenities. As expected, the variable is significant and negative. Sivitanidou (1996) uses a dummy for area prestige, intended to capture the positive effect of prestigious addresses on commercial property values. This variable is found to be positive and significant. (13) Proportion of land used for commercial purposes. Moses and Williamson (1967) use the percentage of land in manufacturing use. This variable is significant and positive. For the same variable, Cheshire & Sheppard's (1995) results show that it is not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) uses a measure of employment concentration in finance, legal, and business services in the property's immediate environment. This variable is also called ""local service"". It is significant, and it exhibits the expected (positive) sign. (14) Worker amenities. Perceived as important exogenous determinants of worker utility and, as such, residential land values and local wages, worker amenities are proxies in Sivitanidou (1996) by average crime rate in the city, retail and motion picture employment per resident population, and distance from each property to the ocean (the study is about Los Angeles). These variables are positive and significant. Cheshire & Sheppard (1995) use the percent of land in either accessible or inaccessible open space around the site. Although the sign is always positive, significance depends both on the sample and the kind of amenity. (15) Land supply constraints. Moses and Williamson (1967) use the percentage of vacant land zoned for manufacturing and commercial purposes. In their study, this variable is not significant. Sivitanidou (1996) proxies land supply restrictions with the percentage of commercially zoned land measured at the city district level. The variable is significant and negative. (16) Lot size. According to Downing (1973), a trade-off exists between the size of a lot purchased by a firm and the cost of constructing improvements. Increasing the size of a site will reduce improvement costs. However, the greater the increase in site size, the smaller the 95   marginal improvement cost savings. Thus, it is expected that the value of land per square foot decreases as the size of the lot increases. The empirical results show that this variable is significant and negative. This variable is also used in Grass (1992) and Cheshire & Sheppard (1995). (17) Corner influence is measured by determining the last two digits of the site address, subtracting them from the last two digits of the estimated middle-of-the-block address, and squaring the result. Thereby, sites located close to the ends of a block would receive a higher weight than those located close to the center. This procedure is used in Downing (1973): the variable is found significant only for long blocks. (18) Building traits. Grass (1992) uses the number of bathrooms (significant, positive) and the building size (significant, positive). Cheshire and Sheppard (1995) use the number of bedrooms (positive, significant), the number of bathrooms (positive, significant), the number of floors (positive, significant), the size in square feet (positive, significant), the width of the plot (not significant), and dummies for terrace-style (negative, significant), semi-detached (negative, significant), flat (negative, significant), parking (not significant), garage (positive, significant), and central heating (positive, significant). Sivitanidou (1996) uses the age of the building (negative and significant), the average floor area (not significant), the number of elevators (positive and significant), and dummies for metal frame (negative and significant), external glass walls (positive and significant), external wooden walls (negative and significant), and subterranean parking (positive and significant). Additional Comments on the Selection of Variables Area Dummies. Several articles use area dummies in addition to the variables listed above. Downing (1973) takes into account development intensity regulation zoning, and assigns variables to all zones, except the one where development regulations are more strict. Thus, each variable will measure the value of an allowed increase in the intensity of use over the least intense zone. It is expected that each variable will have a positive influence on land value and the value of the regression coefficients should increase with the intensity of use allowed. His results show that these variables are significant. Moses and Williamson (1967) include a dummy variable indicating whether the zone is outside the city (Chicago). It was introduced to catch the effects of zoning policies, property tax rates, etc. between the central city and the surrounding area. This variable is not significant. Finally, in their study of residential property values in two English cities, Cheshire & Sheppard (1995) include area dummies that account for the particular secondary school catchment zone where each house is located. Differences Among Land Markets. According to Downing (1973), there are at least two reasons why residential, industrial, and commercial land uses can be treated as distinct markets for the purposes of determining the factors which affect land value. First, there are certain barriers and institutional restraints to the transfer of land from one use to another. Second, even if the land market were one market, there is every reason to believe that the different possible uses would bid for the land for different reasons. Thus, the relative importance of the different factors will vary among types of land use. In order to test this hypothesis, Downing runs two Chow tests. He rejects the hypothesis that residential and commercial data come from the same population, and reaches a similar conclusion for commercial and industrial data.  96   Framework and Methodology Methodological Framework As stated in the introduction, the purpose of this report was ""to research and develop a practical methodology for estimating the effect of the proximity of transit on commercial property value."" FTA looked at a cross-section, a sample, of commercial properties located in a specific urban area, to evaluate the distance between these properties and the closest transit stop and then, to estimate the impact of the proximity-to-transit attribute on the properties' value. This evaluation was performed through the use of multiple regression techniques. In the present case, the value of commercial properties was regressed on a set of characteristics, including proximity-to-transit. The estimated coefficient on this variable measured either directly or indirectly the marginal effect of a change in the distance-to-transit on property values. The theoretical underpinning of this type of approach is the hedonic model presented in the literature review. Methodological Issues to Consider Several methodological issues need to be addressed before discussing the estimation procedure itself: Which type of commercial properties should be included in the analysis? What is the appropriate area of study and, in particular, what is the shape of the city under examination? Do different forms of public transportation have different impacts on property values? And finally, how should the commercial properties be selected? There are roughly four types of commercial properties: (1) retail stores, (2) personal businesses, (3) offices and (4) industrial properties such as factories or warehouses. As explained in the literature survey, the nature of the benefits of the proximity of transit will vary across property types. Public transit facilitates customer access to retail stores and personal businesses. Other things equal, the shorter the distance between a store and a transit stop, the larger the expected volume of sales generated by that store. This excess volume of sales will be capitalized in the ""value"" of the store. The value of office spaces and industrial properties is enhanced by the proximity of transit because it lowers the cost of accessing the workforce. A firm located near a transit stop will benefit from an implicit, or explicit, reduction in costs. This cost reduction will be capitalized in the value of the firm. From all that, it is preferable to differentiate between stores on the one hand and offices and industrial properties on the other hand. This can be done by either conducting two separate analyses - separate samples - or by using dichotomous dummy--variables in a single ""model"". What is the appropriate area of study? The initial area of study will be a major metropolitan area. It will be either a monocentric city, a polycentric city or an edge city. Should we expect the proximity of transit to have a different impact in different cities? A priori, yes. The impact of transit is likely to be weaker in polycentric or edge cities where economic activity is more dispersed. Besides, the analysis of polycentric cities would require the introduction of additional explanatory variables into the model: the distances to the secondary business districts. Ideally, the analysis should be performed for one city of each type. FTA started with Washington D.C., which can clearly be viewed as a monocentric city.  97   Do different forms of transit have different impacts on property values? Previous studies have shown that the proximity to a metro station had a greater impact on residential property values. Similar findings are expected for commercial property values. Thereby, the data used in this report will include the distance to the closest bus stop and the distance to the closest metro station. Separate regressions can be run to evaluate which mode of transportation has the greater impact on commercial properties. How Should the Commercial Properties Be Selected? In some earlier studies, commercial - or residential - properties have been selected within radiuses around a pre-defined set of transit stops. In other words, in these studies, the researcher first chose a sample of Metro stations or Bus stops and then randomly selected a set of properties located around these stations and stops. An alternative approach consists in randomly selecting a set of properties within the area of study and then, identifying the Metro stations and Bus stops located near these properties. This is the approach followed here. Specification of the Model Specifying a model implies several steps. The first step consists in defining the variable of interest, the variable that will be ""explained"" by the model. In the present study, it is the value of commercial properties located within the study area. The variations in value across properties can be explained by a limited set of characteristics, including the proximity of transit. Therefore, the most general form for the model will be: Y=f(X,d) With Y: the dependent variable, some measure of commercial property value; f: a function to be specified; X: a set of characteristics (building traits, neighborhood characteristics, etc.); d: a variable measuring proximity to transit. The Dependent Variable (Y) The endogenous variable will be the assessment value, the listed asking price, of a commercial property divided by the size of the property. The unit of measurement for this variable will be dollars - or thousands of dollars - per square foot. The actual transaction price would be the appropriate variable for an hedonic study but: (1) the number of transactions is likely to be rather small, (2) the assessment value is generally a good proxy for the actual selling price and (3) the use of actual transactions might create a ""selectivity bias"". If actual transactions were used, the commercial properties in the sample would presumably have characteristics that explain why they have been sold during the particular period under examination. These ""hidden"" characteristics are also likely to influence the value of these properties. Theory shows that in this case, estimating price equations without correcting for the selection process might yield biased estimates of the model coefficients. Explanatory Variable Selection (X and d) The model should include a limited set of variables that account for as much variation in commercial property value as possible. Omitting relevant variables or including irrelevant 98   variables should be avoided. Two important issues must be considered: (1) the existence of substitutes to public transportation, in particular the access to low-cost parking space or the proximity of a large, non-congested road; (2) the homogeneity of the area under examination. As stated in the review of the literature, hedonic prices reflect supply and demand equilibria. The problem is to define the relevant market for the study at hand. The real estate market being a collection of relatively separate sub-markets, a common problem in real estate studies consists in aggregating heterogeneous areas in the same analysis, in committing the aggregation error34. In order to avoid such error, the researcher can either perform separate analyses or control for the areas' attributes through the use of dummy variables. Another concern is the presence of multicollinearity, i.e. collinearity among explanatory variables. A good example here would be the relationship between employment density and proximity to transit. Holding other things constant - with or without transit stop, in particular - a property will be more expensive in a commercially active area. In such areas, we expect to find more transit stops i.e. shorter walking distances for all shops of the sample located in the area. In other words, the employment density and the proximity of transit are likely to be positively correlated. When multicollinearity is severe, it is very difficult to estimate individual regression coefficients precisely35. In other words, the estimation results are not reliable. In the present example, it would be very difficult to isolate the effect of proximity to transit from the pure density effect. What can be done? There are two options: the first consists in suppressing redundant variables, the second in performing factor analyses to ""summarize"" redundant variables into a single ""factor."" From all that, the model will be specified to include a mix of property characteristics (real estate data) and location characteristics (geographical and socioeconomic data). Real Estate Data: Relevant property characteristics will include the size of the property in square feet and a set of building attributes: age of the building, availability of parking space and other items. The value of a commercial property per square foot is likely to decrease as the size of the property increases. In other words, the coefficient associated with the size variable is likely to be negative. Other things equal, retail stores and offices located in more recent buildings are likely to be ""more expensive"". Similarly, the proximity of parking space is likely to enhance the value of commercial properties. Geographical Data: The model will include various location attributes that are thought to affect the value of commercial properties: distance to the CBD, to the closest bus stop or metro station, to the closest airport, and to the closest freeway. The inclusion of ""distance to the CBD"" among the explanatory variables results from the conclusions of basic urban economic models where the spatial distribution of land prices is determined by the transportation costs to the CBD - the negative rent or land price gradient. Since the price of land should decline with distance from the CBD, the corresponding coefficient is expected to be negative. Distances to the closest airport and to the closest freeway account for the value associated with transportation accessibility; both are expected to have a negative coefficient. Type of street, traffic level or distance from the main street can be used to account for access to consumers, but also for the level of traffic disturbance 34  Mahlon Straszheim, ""Hedonic Estimation of Housing Market Prices: A Further Comment"", in The Review of Economics and Statistics, 1973, pp. 404-6 Damodar Gujarati, ""Basic Econometrics"", Second Edition, 1988, pp. 283-315  35  99   to which a site is subject. As the actual observed effect would be the net outcome of these two effects, the expected sign is uncertain. The variable of primary interest is the distance to the closest transit stop. The coefficient associated with this variable is expected to be negative. Socioeconomic Data: Various neighborhood characteristics will be included in the model: population or employment density, median income, density of commercial activities and, if possible, some proxy for the availability of worker amenities. A larger population should positively increase expected sales and labor availability. We expect this variable to have a positive sign. The neighborhood's median income reflects customers' purchasing power and the quality of a property's surrounding neighborhood. Therefore, this variable is likely to have a positive coefficient. The density of commercial activities and the availability of worker amenities are also likely to influence the value of commercial properties. While the former is intended to reflect urbanization externalities, the latter should positively influence workers' location. Both are expected to have a positive effect on commercial properties. Functional Form Selection In the literature, non-linear functional forms have been preferred on theoretical and empirical grounds (see Section 2.3). In particular, log-linear and semi-log models have been used repeatedly in hedonic studies. HLB proposes to try a more flexible approach: the use of a BoxCox transformation. A rapid review of the different forms that could be used in the study is presented below. The Linear Model: Pi =  0 + p   k =1   k x ki + d i + i  With Pi: assessment value of the ith commercial property; xki: kth characteristic of the ith property; di: distance to the closest metro station or bus stop; i: error term, what is left unexplained by the model; 0, k, : coefficients to be estimated. The coefficient of interest is . The value of this coefficient can be interpreted increase in property value brought about by a one-unit change in the proximity assumption of linearity implies that whatever the distance to transit, a one-unit distance to transit produces a constant  dollars per square-foot increase in the The Semi-Log Model: ln Pi =  0 + p  as the average of transit. The reduction in the property's value.   k =1   k x ki + d i +   i  Where ln P is the natural logarithm of P.  can be interpreted here as the relative or percentage change in property value produced by a one-unit change in the distance to transit. This model implies the existence of a linear relationship between the log of the dependent variable P and the explanatory variables (see Figure 6.6 in the Annex).  100   The Log-Linear Model: ln Pi =  0 + In this specification,  is the relative percent change in distance to transit. to as a constant elasticity model: the the elasticity of P with respect to d The Box-Cox Model: Pi =  0 +   k =1  p   k ln x ki +  ln d i +   i  or percentage change in property value produced by a oneThe log-linear, or double-log, model is sometimes referred percentage change in P for a given percentage change in d is constant throughout the range of the variable d.  x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    k D     k x ki +   l C    l  i  With D: set of indices for dichotomous characteristics, dummy variables C: set of indices for continuous variables : transformation parameter to be estimated The Box-Cox model allows for greater flexibility than any of the models presented so far. No functional form36 is chosen a-priori. Instead, the choice of the ""best"" functional form is part of the estimation. From the above formula, it can be shown for example that if  = 1 the model is linear but if  = -1 it is reciprocal in the independent variables. In the estimation,  is treated as an additional unknown parameter. In other words, the estimation procedure consists in determining the parameters and the functional form that best fit the data. This should be contrasted to a typical linear regression where the functional form is set, and where the estimation procedure ""optimizes"" over the parameters of the linear function only. Note from the formula that the dummy variables are not transformed. Finally, the right-hand side variable can also be transformed by the parameter : pi - 1 = 0 +   k D     k x ki +   l C    l   x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    i  In principle, a different transformation parameter (other than ) could be used on the left-hand side variable. But according to Greene (1993), this transformation is often ""more cumbersome than necessary."" Also, it could be possible to allow for different non-linearities on the distance variable. In fact, each regressor could be transformed by a different parameter. But again ""this generality becomes excessively cumbersome in most applications"" Greene (1993). At any rate, the most flexible model that could be estimated for this study is: pi - 1 = 0 +   k D     k x ki +   l C    l   x li - 1 d i - 1 + +    i  Where:  is the transformation parameter for the dependent variable P; 36  Some authors consider the Box-Cox specification as a functional form. For the sake of clarity, we differentiate between the Box-Cox and the (traditional) functional forms: linear, log-linear, s"

The most successful transit systems are those which take people from where they are to where they want to go, when they want to go, at a price they can afford, and do so safely and securely.  These principles are the basis for Federal Transit Administration policies and programs.   At this time, Americans are concerned with a variety of transit issues.  These include providing greater mobility, especially for those with disabilities, the elderly, those in need, and those living in rural areas; improving air quality by such means as use of alternative fuels, clean diesel engines, and such devices as particulate traps or catalytic converters on transit buses; taking advantage of advanced transit technologies in areas such as navigation, information, and communication; and making all transit systems safer and more secure by such means as training, development of regulatory guidelines, and an intensive drug and alcohol information and testing program.  These, and a number of other areas of concern to the public and the transit industry are being treated by the projects listed in this directory of Transit Planning and Research Programs.   The directory will provide you with information on grants and contracts in such areas as advanced public transportation systems, clean air, finance, human resources and productivity, information, policy analysis and evaluation, regional mobility, safety and security, technology development, transit accessibility, planning and project development, and transit cooperative research.  All are aimed at assisting communities and transit operators in their efforts to provide the best possible service to users within available resources.          Gordon J.

Project Title:  Drug and Alcohol Management Information System      Grantee/ Contractor:  Battelle Memorial Institute     Location:  Columbus, Ohio     Funding:  $185,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judy Meade  Project Number:  OH-26-0001           Description:  The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 provided the Federal Transit Administration with a mandate that requires its grantees to develop and implement drug and alcohol programs.  The FTA drug and alcohol rules require grantees to submit annual reports on their testing programs.  These reports serve not only as a compliance tool, but will also provide FTA with data necessary to evaluate effectiveness of the regulations and support any future modifications to the program.  In order to analyze the content of the reports, FTA must establish and maintain a computerized management information system capable of generating information in the form of an annual summary to be utilized by the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, FTA, Congress, and the transit industry.  This funding will serve to develop the management information system, process and analyze the first year's reports from grantees, and generate the first annual summary.     Project Title:  Enforcement and Compliance Strategies for Drug and Alcohol   Regulations      Grantee/ Contractor:  Battelle Memorial Institute     Location:  Columbus, Ohio     Funding:  $50,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judy Meade  Project Number:  OH-26-0001           Description:  The current strategy of the Federal Transit Administration for compliance monitoring of its drug and alcohol regulations has three components:  (1) self-certification, (2) annual reports, and (3) triennial reviews.  However, after three years, the other Department of Transportation operating administrations, which utilize formal and frequent site visits by inspectors to employers, have discovered numerous and serious instances of drug rule compliance failures.  In addition, it has become apparent that collection site and medical review officers are frequently in violation.  Because it has a statutory mandate to withhold funds for failure to comply with the rules, the Federal Transit Administration must be certain that its funds support only those grantees meeting requirements of the rules.  It is recognized that the ability of grantees to comply is related directly to availability of increasingly scarce resources because of Americans with Disabilities and Clean Air requirements.  This think piece project is exploring any additional strategies that FTA may wish to consider for future action.

Grubb  Project Number:  WA-26-9001           Description:  Guidance is being developed on how to incorporate transit facilities and operations into high occupancy vehicle facility design.  For HOVways on freeways, it will consider the number, location, and design of transit centers of stations, the number and location of bus bays and shelters at park-and-ride lots, T-ramps, or other means to provide bus access between the HOVways and transit centers, and buses to move between HOV lanes and other lanes.  The project will also look at signalization options to give buses priority or to allow buses to maneuver across lanes to make turns or pick-ups on arterial HOV facilities.  In conjunction with any HOVway, the study will consider investment in bus fleet expansion to provide new or enhanced service, use of articulated buses, and new or expanded bus maintenance garages to accommodate additional buses.  A guidance manual on these issues is being developed and information from the manual disseminated through conferences, Transportation Research Board papers and journal articles, and other means.        Project Title:  North-South Station Rail Link Feasibility Study      Grantee/Contractor:  KPMG Peat Marwick     Location:  Vienna, Virginia     Funding:  $125,566  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Sheila Cohen  Project Number:  VA-26-9001           and       Grantee/Contractor:  STV/Seelye, Stevenson, Value and Knecht     Location:  New York, New York     Funding:  $77,505  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Sheila Cohen  Project Number:  NY-26-9001           Description:  The feasibility of a rail connection between North Station and South Station in Boston is being analyzed.  Connecting these two stations would better serve commuters to Boston as well as Amtrak riders traveling through the city.  Two tunnel alignments are being studied, one following Congress Street and the other along the Central Artery alignment.     Project Title:  Alternatives Analysis Staff Support      Grantee/Contractor:  S. G. Associates, Inc.     Location:  Annandale, Virginia     Funding:  $115,355  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9002           Description:  The number of new start projects is far in excess of the ability of the Federal Transit Administration to provide technical oversight in a timely fashion.  Without this oversight, FTA cannot satisfactorily manage the new start program and provide useful cost effectiveness data to top management and the Congress.  Task order contractors are providing technical support to the Office of Grants Management in review of project planning studies.  Areas of review are capital operating and maintenance costing, financial assessment, environmental impact assessment, and ridership forecasting.     Project Title:  Travel Behavioral Research      Grantee/Contractor:  Federal Highway Administration     Location:  Washington, D. C.     Funding:  $200,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9014           Description:  Conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act and difficulties with past transit projections imply that significant improvements are needed in current model structures.  The objective of this study is to discover travel behavioral correlations which will result in improved travel demand model structures.  The determinants of travel behavior are being studied using data which has been collected from comprehensive travel behavioral surveys conducted recently.  The comprehensive nature of this survey allows for examination of many travel demand issues which have been unresolved due to limited data.    Project Title:  Travel Time Budgets      Grantee/Contractor:  Federal Highway Administration     Location:  Washington, D. C.     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Ronald Jensen-Fisher  Project Number:  VA-26-9015           Description:  In the 1970's, the theory was advanced that individuals have a travel time budget and a travel cost budget.  These budgets serve as limits to how much travel individuals are willing to do.  This project is examining available data to determine whether evidence exists to either support or refute this theory.  Information being examined includes panel surveys, recent home interview surveys, the National Personal Transportation Survey, and other sources.  Conclusions will be drawn on the validity of travel budgets and methods of incorporating budgets into the traditional travel forecasting process.  The Federal Highway Administration and Federal Transit Administration are jointly undertaking a major update of the travel forecasting process.  This project ties directly into that effort.  Establishing the travel time budget theory would directly improve the ability to forecast individual response to additional highway capacity, supporting the alternatives analysis process.  Further, the concept has implications for analysis of air quality.      Project Title:  Portland Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Greater Portland Council of Governments.     Location:  Portland, Maine     Funding:  $65,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Judith A. Molloy  Project Number:  ME-26-0002           Description:  The City Manager has requested funding to develop an intermodal terminal for Portland.  The Federal Transit Administration recently awarded a project to the Maine Department of Transportation for a study of commuter rail from Boston to Portland which included selection of a station site from three potential sites in Portland.  This project is for preliminary design work for the station and includes layout, vehicular traffic access, intermodal connections, rail operations assessment, and integration with other existing and potential uses.     Project Title:  Orlando Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Orange-Seminole-Osceola Transportation Authority     Location:  Orlando, Florida     Funding:  $400,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Brian A. Glenn  Project Number:  FL-26-0003           Description:  In 1988, Florida enacted the Maglev Demonstration Act which authorized the granting of a State franchise for private sector development of a demonstration of Maglev technology in Florida.  In June of 1991, the Governor and Florida Cabinet awarded a franchise for this demonstration to MAGLEV Transit, Inc.  MTI is an American company with considerable Japanese and German involvement.  The Bechtel Corporation will build the system.  A preliminary site selection study was completed and now a site planning study for the International Drive Station and support facilities is required.  The private developer has completed conceptual plans for this station, but these do not include capacity and interfaces with local transit, Orlando Airport, and intercity bus and rail services.  There is a need for the State, local governments, and the developer to complete preliminary design studies to accommodate all of these services.  The study will include plans for an interface with local transit providers and hotel shuttles, highway access and parking, and interface with amusement park transportation. The Orlando Airport is planning for the Maglev to enter the airport using AIP funds, and looks on the International Drive Station as an off-site airline.     Project Title:  Chicago Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Illinois Department of Transportation.     Location:  Chicago, Illinois     Funding:  $160,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Carlos Peña  Project Number:  IL-26-0003           Description:  Chicago is a key hub in a midwest high speed rail network of lines linking St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee.  These lines have been designated a high speed rail corridor under Section 1010 of Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act and show great promise for development.  A key element of this high speed rail system is linking downtown areas with the airports.  Routes to St. Louis, Detroit, and Milwaukee will link airports as well as city centers.  Chicago METRA and the city have been discussing the possibility of an intermodal terminal at O'Hare Airport which joins METRA and Amtrak service with local bus service and the airport people mover.  The airport has major ground access problems and is looking for an alternative bus marshaling site.  The terminal would be located on an airport satellite parking lot crossed by a rail line owned by the Wisconsin Central Railroad which, according to the DOT, is in favor of shared use of the line.  A site selection study was done by METRA and a preliminary design for a bus terminal has also been completed.  By combining public transportation providers and tour operators, the resulting enclosed multi-use facility will result which would provide a direct link between O'Hare and the entire midwest rail passenger network.     Project Title:  Milwaukee Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Wisconsin Department of Transportation     Location:  Madison, Wisconsin     Funding:  $100,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Carlos Peña  Project Number:  WI-26-0001           Description:  Milwaukee to Chicago is on one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  It is important that Milwaukee have a well designed, high capacity, downtown passenger terminal which combines public transit with intercity service providers.  The high speed rail line planned to Chicago could connect to General Mitchell Airport outside Milwaukee and would provide an important link in the midwest network and with O'Hare Airport.  This project is preparing a plan to develop an intermodal transportation center in the Milwaukee area with necessary facilities and connections to efficiently link inter- and intra-regional transportation modes serving the area.  Inter-regional modes to be served include existing Amtrak service, potential future high speed rail passenger service linking the Milwaukee and Chicago areas, commercial air passenger service, and intercity bus service operated by private carriers.  A consensus is being developed on the location and development of an intermodal transportation terminal and connections to efficiently link inter- and intra-regional travel modes in the greater Milwaukee area.  Currently, these facilities are located in individual terminals with no connectors.  The implementation of an intermodal transportation terminal after completion of this study is expected to significantly enhance the use of multimodal transportation in southwestern Wisconsin and lessen dependence on the private auto for travel.    Project Title:  Denver Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Denver Regional Council of Governments     Location:  Denver, Colorado     Funding:  $93,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Donald D. Cover  Project Number:  CO-26-0002           Description:  Denver Mayor Webb has requested funding for further study of rail to both Stapleton Airport and the new International Airport from downtown Denver.  Because of its study of airport access improvement alternatives, the Federal Transit Administration has recommended a study with exclusive focus on an airport-CBD rail link.  The Federal Railroad Administration and FTA believe that a study element focusing on improved access to existing intercity rail and bus facilities should also be added to the proposed scope.  FTA and FRA are in agreement that a study of airport access alternatives should be included in the next phase of work.  The City of Denver has informally agreed to this.  The project is part of a draft unified plan work program voted on in November 1992.  The Denver Regional Council of Governments has informally agreed to provide funds to the City for the study.  This project is only for a planning study conditioned on inclusion of a study of airport access options.     Project Title:  Seattle Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Washington State Department of Transportation     Location:  Olympia, Washington     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Rita M. Healy  Project Number:  WA-80-X003           Description:  Seattle is one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  The corridor extends from Eugene, Oregon, through Portland and Seattle into Vancouver, British Columbia.  This is Phase II of a study for a downtown intermodal terminal at the southernmost station of Seattle's bus subway.  The impetus for this is growth of traffic and pollution problems.  The city recently completed a study of commuter rail service possibilities for the area and is discussing operating requirements and costs with Amtrak, Burlington Northern, Union Pacific, and others.  The city has also studied a high speed connector to SEATAC airport.  In January 1992, the Federal Railroad Administration gave $500,000 to the State toward a high speed rail feasibility in the Vancouver-Seattle-Portland area.  The funding requested for an intermodal terminal study would connect these rail systems with city transit, Greyhound Bus, tour operators, and other transportation providers at the Burlington Northern downtown station.      Project Title:  San Antonio Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  San Antonio-Bexar County Management Planning Organization     Location:  San Antonio, Texas     Funding:  $93,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Margaret J. Crist  Project Number:  TX-26-0008           Description:  The State of Texas submitted an application for a Section 1010 grant for the corridor between San Antonio and Monterrey, Mexico.  This corridor was not selected , but an application by the Metropolitan Planning Organization to study development of an intermodal terminal on San Antonio's east side has strong local, State, and private backing.  The MPO is planning a feasibility study for an intermodal terminal for downtown San Antonio near the current VIA local transit operator-owned rail station to result in a conceptual design for the project, capital and operating cost estimates, and a financial and implementation strategy.  The specific scope of work is being overseen by a public/private steering committee composed of representatives from Amtrak, Greyhound, Kerrville Bus Company of Texas, High Speed Rail, the San Antonio-Laredo-Monterrey operator, the Texas Department of Transportation, VIA Metropolitan Transit, the City of San Antonio, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads.     Project Title:  Detroit Intermodal Terminal Study      Grantee/Contractor:  Michigan Department of Transportation     Location:  Lansing, Michigan     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Mary J. Campbell  Project Number:  MI-26-0004           Description:  Detroit is one of the high speed rail corridors selected under Section 1010 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  The City and State Departments of Transportation have completed a site selection study for an intermodal terminal and have determined it should be at New Center located at the junction of heavily traveled Woodward Avenue and a major rail corridor.  The terminal blends Amtrak, local/regional transit, intercity bus, taxi, airport shuttle, and highway travel modes together in one centralized connecting hub.  The center will also support anticipated new services, including regional rail, VIA Rail Canada, and planned high speed intercity rail operations and serve as an effective mechanism to interface literally all local, regional, and intercity transportation resources with major economic, social, educational, and commercial activities within the City of Detroit and throughout the southeast Michigan region. Funds have been requested for a planning and engineering design study.  This terminal has been designed to serve as a strategic transportation hub to facilitate not only expanded intermodal mobility benefits, but also contribute directly toward a variety of urban development opportunities within the Woodward Corridor area.  The center will link all existing and future rail passenger services directly to this area which is the most heavily traveled transit artery in the region.  This important new rail/transit link is further complemented by intermodal links with airport shuttle service to Detroit Metropolitan and Detroit City Airports and with intercity bus, taxi, and highway services.       Project Title:  Review of Local Planning Processes and Products Staff Support      Grantee/Contractor:  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center     Location:  Cambridge, Massachusetts     Funding:  $150,000  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Deborah Burns  Project Number:  MA-08-9030           Description:  The number of ongoing urban transportation planning efforts is far in excess of the ability of the Federal Transit Administration to provide technical and administrative oversight in a timely fashion.  Without this oversight, FTA cannot satisfactorily manage the Section 8 planning program to assure compliance with Federal statutes and regulations.  Therefore,  ongoing support for FTA Headquarters and Regional staff in their review of local planning processes and the products derived from them is being provided by the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center.  The Clean Air and Americans with Disabilities Acts focused new attention on transportation improvement programs as well as adopted long range and State implementation plans developed as part of the ongoing transportation planning process.  There is also a need for review of ongoing efforts for compliance with joint Federal Transit Administration/Federal Highway Administration metropolitan planning regulations.      Project Title:  Evaluation of Construction Projects      Grantee/Contractor:  FAI, Inc.     Location:  McLean, Virginia     Funding:  $117,091  Funding Source:  Section 26     Project Manager:  Salvator S. Caruso  Project Number:  VA-26-7003           Description:  Cost overruns typically experienced on major transit capital projects suggest that transit agencies may be using weak contracts.  A study of 13 fixed guideway projects indicates that capital cost variances for these projects range from 26 to 150 percent.  Change orders and claims were major contributing factors.  Several Federal Transit Administration project management oversight contractors indicated that improved contracts may reduce the amount of capital cost variance.  Consistent with the National Transportation Policy and the FTA Strategic Plan, this project is evaluating contracts used by transit agencies for design and construction of capital projects, including new fixed guideway systems and maintenance facilities.  Based on these evaluations, the contractor will make recommendations for elimination of ambiguities and contradictory language in contracts to better define responsibilities and provide more effective incentives to control change orders and avoid claims.  This project will improve productivity and reduce cost of transit construction projects.

GX234-05-9814982	June 13, 1997   For more information contact:  Samil Sermet, 515-237-3309      DOT HONORS TOP IOWA TRANSIT AGENCIES       AMES, IOWA -  Transit systems from Ames and Davenport have been honored by the Iowa Department of Transportation for their accomplishments during the 1996 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 1996.    The Ames Transit Agency (CyRide) won the Transit System of the Year award for urban systems.  For regional systems, the award went to Great River Bend Services Inc. of Davenport.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.    Ames Transit Agency, headed by Robert Bourne, director of transportation, posted an 11.6 percent gain in ridership while decreasing the cost per ride 6.3 percent during fiscal year 1996.  Increased marketing, increased ridership on the Iowa State University campus, and containment of operating costs helped the system become the most improved urban transit system.    Ridership on the Great River Bend Services Inc. system increased 13.0 percent while the cost per ride dropped 8.2 percent.  This earned them the Transit System of the Year Award for regional systems.  Ermadel Ludwick, executive director of the system, attributed the 1996 gains to a new contract with the Davenport school system, and to significant increases in ridership in several existing contracts, combined with reduced maintenance and administrative costs.     The awards were announced June 12 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Ottumwa.  The conference is a training conference sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.    At the conference, Roger Anderberg, director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies which had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Creston (Area XIV Agency on Aging, Southern Iowa Trolley), Ottumwa (Ten-Fifteen Regional Transit Agency), and Sioux City (Siouxland Regional Transit System); and the urban transit systems in Muscatine (City Transit System/MuscaBus), Council Bluffs (City of Council Bluffs), and Marshalltown (Marshalltown Municipal Transit).    There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #

It is a conception           of the future, proposing the direction for transit in Florida into the           21st Century.                                      Developed           by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) in collaboration           with state and local government agencies, transit providers, community           leaders and the general public,  Transit 2020            articulates a common vision of the future of public transit in           Florida's urban areas.                                                  As the           transit element of the  Florida Transportation Plan ,            Transit 2020  will help provide the policy           framework that links Florida's transportation goals and objectives           with FDOT's annual budget and 5-year work program.                                                  The           primary purpose of  Transit 2020  is to support           the development of a transit system that provides Floridians and           visitors with an effective, efficient and customer-friendly transit           service in a transit-friendly environment. The plan reexamines the           role of transit in the context of a changing transportation           environment. Through an analysis of the strengths, weakness,           opportunities and threats to Florida's transit industry, it defines           the industry's emerging core values, mission and vision.                                                  It           should be noted that because the Florida Commission for the           Transportation Disadvantaged (CTD) is primarily responsible for           paratransit planning in Florida, the scope of  Transit 2020             is limited to those services provided by Florida's 20 fixed-route           urban transit systems.                                                  This           document summarizes the key issues, goals, objectives, strategies and           tasks developed with information gathered over the past 18 months from           members of District and Statewide Transit Strategic Plan Advisory           Committees, stakeholder interviews, focus groups, a statewide transit           survey, FDOT staff, research and analysis by the project team, and           comments from the general public. It also includes a summary           implementation program and guiding principles for  Transit           2020 .                                                                                                    The three key issue areas are: transit service,           funding and planning/policy. For each issue, a goal and a set of           objectives, strategies and tasks have been identified to set the           priority direction for transit in Florida as we move into the 21st           Century. Context           and Vision                                      Florida's exceptional natural           environment and strong economic growth continue to make it a very           attractive place to live and work and one of the world's leaders in           tourism. Between 1990 and 1997, Florida's population grew by about 14           percent to 14.7 million, making it the fourth most populous state in           the nation. This rapid growth and development has placed tremendous           pressures on Florida's transportation system. Heavy volumes of traffic           in most of the state's urbanized areas have created excessive           congestion. Increasing suburbanization of population and employment           has resulted in greater automobile use. Given the continuing dispersal           of jobs and residents, roadway congestion is likely to worsen. In some           metropolitan areas, transportation systems are expected to become           increasingly saturated, even with implementation of roadway           improvements defined in current long-range transportation plans.                                                                                                   In view of the above trends in           Florida's growth and development, members of the Transit Strategic           Plan Advisory Committee recognized that land use patterns have great           implications for transit effectiveness and resoundingly approved the           following vision for transit in Florida:                                                                                                                                                   Excessive                 congestion created by heavy volumes of traffic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Florida's Choice:            User-friendly transit and transit-friendly development             It is a vision of a Florida in which transportation and land           use planning are coordinated; customer-oriented transit services           provide seamless intermodal travel; and residents and visitors view           transit as a realistic and viable alternative to the personal           automobile. Above all, it is a vision of the quality of life in           Florida.                                                 Goal 1:                         Transit Service                                     Implement a transit system that improves and expands           travel choices for Floridians and visitors.                                                 Issue:                                                  The level of transit service for most Floridians is inadequate and will           worsen given current trends.                                        Background:                                                  Existing           levels of transit service make it unattractive as an alternative           travel mode for most Floridians except for those who do not have other           means of travel. Existing transit services can fairly be characterized           as marginal due to limited service hours, infrequent service, and lack           of service to many employment centers, commerce, education and           recreation, particularly in the suburbs. The average transit headway           in Florida is one hour and the average daily span of service is 13           hours. Florida's revenue miles per square mile (a measure of service           supply) is 23 percent lower than the national average.                                                  The Department is committed to expanding travel choices for           Floridians and visitors.    Transportation           needs into the 21st Century cannot be met with highways alone.           Improved public transportation is crucial to expanding travel choices.                                                                           Objective 1.1:                           Improved Core Service                                     Achieve the quantity and quality of local transit (core) service           sufficient to increase transit ridership in Florida at twice the           average rate of population growth through 2020.

Issue:                                                 Current           transit funding levels are inadequate to fund existing as well as           expanded capital, maintenance and operating programs; several funding           sources lack stability and flexibility.                                        Background:                                                 Existing transit funding levels           from all sources are inadequate. A recent study by the University of           South Florida indicated a shortfall of $9 billion (over 20 years) in           12 of the 25 local long-range plans. The remaining long-range plans           did not distinguish shortfalls between modes. Existing funding streams           may not be sufficient to maintain current service. As discussed           earlier, current service is far short of what is needed. Existing           funding levels are not sufficient to provide expanded capital,           maintenance, and operating programs that will be required to improve           overall service quantity and quality.                                                  In addition to the general insufficiency, some existing           funding sources lack stability and flexibility. The lack of stability           makes it difficult for transit agencies to plan service, even in the           short run.                                                                                                                Objective 2.1:                           Adequate Funding                                     Achieve           adequate and stable funding levels to meet transit needs for service           preservation, operating and capital expansion, and technological           innovation.

Background:                                                 Transit performance is ultimately           affected by a number of planning and policy related factors including           land use, institutional practices and public perception. Current land           use and urban design patterns characterized by sprawling low density           developments are not conducive to efficient transit operations. To           improve its performance, transit needs to be better integrated into           the transportation and land use planning process. The institutional           roles and responsibilities of Florida's major transit partners are           sometimes fuzzy and overlapping, creating the potential for           ""passing the buck"" and duplication of effort. Furthermore,           poor coordination among transit partners results in a dissipation of           effort and lack of clear and coherent public communication on the           benefits of transit to the community. As a result, the public is often           unaware of available transit services and the potential benefits of           transit. Lacking information on transit and its benefits, the public           withholds its political support for transit.                                          The success of transit in Florida ultimately requires the           coordinated effort of all levels of government working with the public           to promote transit as a public good.                                                                                                  ""The problems we face today cannot                 be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we                 created them""                                                                                                                                                                                           - Albert Einstein                                                                                               Objective 3.1:                           Transit-Oriented Development                                     Promote           land use planning and urban design practices that facilitate transit           service and access.

There is no doubt that the overall quality and content of  Transit           2020  has been greatly enhanced by the diligent and           dedicated participation of these Floridians in the public meetings,           stakeholder interviews, focus groups and survey. The very effective           citizen participation in the development of  Transit 2020             makes it truly a transit plan for Florida by Floridians.                                                  We           extend special thanks to the men and women who guided the development           of the plan through their service on the District and Statewide           Advisory Committees.

Davenport CitiBus won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional systems went to 10-15 Regional Transit Agency of Ottumwa.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.     Davenport CitiBus posted a 7.1 percent gain in ridership, which helped reduce the cost per ride by 5.4 percent during fiscal year 1998.  CitiBus is operated under contract by Rock Island County Metropolitan Mass Transit District, headed by Jeff Nelson.  Byron Baxter, director of transportation with the City of Davenport, attributed the 1998 gain to an extension of one route to new business developments on the east side, and to the stability of existing routes and fares.     Ridership on the Ottumwa based 10-15 Transit increased 13.9 percent, while the cost per ride dropped 3.8 percent.  Pam Ward, transit administrator for both the 10-15 Regional Transit Agency and the Ottumwa Transit Authority, explained that a significant portion of the increase occurred in three communities that hosted the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa.  Shuttle service between campgrounds and local attractions for RAGBRAI visitors was provided by 10-15 Transit.  This was the third ""System of the Year"" award for 10-15 Transit, and the second award since Ward has been the administrator. The awards were announced June 10 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Fort Dodge.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.     At the conference, Thomas Parham, deputy director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies that had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Mason City (North Iowa Area Regional Transit System), Creston (Area XIV Agency on Aging, Southern Iowa Trolley), and Davenport (Great River Bend Services, Inc.); and the urban transit system in Mason City.     There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #"
GX233-63-11071625	June 23, 1998   For more information contact:  Samil Sermet, 515-237-3309   BURLINGTON, DECORAH TOP TRANSIT AGENCIES FOR 1997    AMES, IOWA - Transit systems from Burlington and Decorah have been honored by the Iowa Department of Transportation for their accomplishments during the 1997 fiscal year which ended June 30, 1997.    Burlington Urban Service (BUS) won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional systems went to Northeast Regional Transit System (NERTS) of Decorah.  The awards were based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.    Burlington Urban Service, headed by Larry Gantz, posted a 4.8 percent gain in ridership, which helped reduce the cost per ride by 15.3 percent during fiscal year 1997.  New bus purchases improved rider satisfaction and reduced road calls/breakdowns.  These factors and local cost-containment measures helped the staff at BUS make service improvements.    Ridership on the Decorah based NERTS, managed by Northeast Iowa Community Action Inc., increased 13.5 percent during fiscal year 1997.  Marian Peter, NERTS manager, attributed improved ridership to    coordination efforts that focused on meeting local service needs under innovative contracting arrangements that entailed shared use of state and federal funding.  A significant portion of the NERTS ridership increase during 1997 occurred in three communities that hosted the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa.  NERTS provided shuttle services for RAGBRAI visitors between campgrounds and local attractions.  NERTS drivers also attribute much of the 13.6 percent improvement in cost per ride to the more flexible passenger seating of the new vehicles, which improved dispatching efficiency.    The awards were announced June 18 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Iowa City.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.    At the conference, Larry Jesse, director of the DOT's Office of Local Systems, also recognized other transit agencies that had made improvements.  These included the regional transit systems in Mason City (North Iowa Area Regional Transit System), Waterloo (Iowa Northland Regional Transit Commission), and Cedar Rapids (East Central Iowa Transit); and the urban transit system in Mason City.    There are 16 regional and 19 urban transit systems in Iowa.    #

City Transit System/MuscaBus of Muscatine won the award for the most improved urban transit system of the year.  The award for regional transit systems went to Northeast Regional Transit System of Decorah.  The awards are based on a combination of ridership increases and decreases in the cost per ride.   MuscaBus, which was headed by Kathy Meier, posted an 8.9 percent gain in ridership that helped reduce the cost per ride by 2.4 percent during fiscal year 1999.  Increased service to the elderly and persons with disabilities, as well as to students and plant workers, helped the system make these improvements.  This is the second ""System of the Year"" award for MuscaBus, which is currently managed by Karen Wilcox.   Ridership on the Decorah-based Northeast Regional Transit System, which is managed by Northeast Iowa Community Action Corp., increased 19.9 percent while the cost per ride dropped 18.2 percent.  Earl Henry, manager for NRTS attributed the 1999 gains to better coordination efforts that resulted in significant increases in ridership in several existing contracts, coupled with reduced maintenance and administrative costs.  This is also the second ""System of the Year"" award for NRTS.   The awards were announced June 15 at the Iowa Public Transit Conference in Dubuque.  The conference is sponsored jointly by the Iowa Public Transit Association and the Iowa DOT.   At the conference, DOT officials recognized other transit agencies that had also made improvements.

Transit-oriented            development is a planning concept that seeks to use mass transit stations            as building blocks for economic revitalization and environmental improvement.            In September 1999, groundbreaking took place on a $100 million mixed-use            development adjacent to the Fruitvale Bay Area Rapid Transit District            (BART) station in Oakland, California. Fruitvale, one of Oakland's seven            community districts, is a low-income, predominantly minority community            experiencing economic stress. This case study focuses on the incorporation            of environmental justice principles into the planning and design of            the Fruitvale Transit Village.                   The            Fruitvale Transit Village is the brainchild of the Unity Council, a            community development corporation formed in 1964 by activists who wanted            to create a forum for working on issues important to Fruitvale's Latino            community. The origins of the project date back to 1991, when BART announced            plans to construct a multi-layered parking facility next to the Fruitvale            station. Although the community agreed that new parking            was necessary, the design and location of the facility did not sit well            with Fruitvale residents and business owners. Members of the community            were concerned that the proposed structure would increase traffic and            pollution and further separate the Fruitvale neighborhood from the BART            station. The Unity Council galvanized neighborhood opposition to the            parking structure design and location, arguing that any development            around the BART station should be guided by a broad-based community            planning process.                   Faced            with this strong community opposition, BART withdrew its proposal and            agreed to work with the Unity Council on a plan for the area. During            the next several years, the Unity Council engaged local stakeholders            in a comprehensive visioning and planning process that laid out the            parameters of the Fruitvale Transit Village. Plans for the Transit Village            include a mixture of housing, shops, offices, a library, a child care            facility, a pedestrian plaza, and other community services all surrounding            the BART station. The project is expected to reduce traffic and pollution            in and around Fruitvale because community residents will have access            to a range of goods and services within easy walking distance of the            transit station.                   The            Fruitvale Transit Village project illustrates a number of key themes            and effective practices that are central to incorporating the principles            of environmental justice into transportation planning and design. First,            it demonstrates an effective use of partnerships to generate funding            and other resources necessary to plan and implement a costly and complex            project. The Unity Council's            success in building relationships with a wide range of key players helped            overcome the formidable legal, regulatory, and financial hurdles the            project initially faced.                   In            addition, the project illustrates a strong commitment to public involvement            by the lead agencies involved. Typically, either city officials or private            developers represent the driving force behind large-scale development            projects such as this. Under the best of circumstances, community residents            are usually in the position of responding to plans that are initiated            by others. In this case, however, the Unity Council's leadership role            in the project helped ensure that the community's            own vision for the transit station and its surrounding area served as            guiding principles for the planning and design process.                   Finally,            the planning effort behind the Fruitvale Transit Village represents            an innovative strategy for using mass transit as a lever for revitalizing            an urban community. While transit-oriented development has been successful            in a growing number of affluent suburban locations, the Fruitvale Transit            Village sets a precedent for such projects in lower-income, inner-city            communities.                                                      ""Transportation            planning should be about more than concrete and steel. It should be            about building communities and we are all looking to Fruitvale as an            example of how that can happen.""                             -- Rodney Slater            U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Fruitvale BART Station,             Formal Launch of the Fruitvale Transit Village, July 9, 1999                                                                                                                   What                  is Transit-Oriented Development?                               Transit-Oriented                  Development (TOD) is a simple concept: moderate and high density                  housing, along with complementing public uses, jobs, retail and                  services, are concentrated in mixed-use developments located at                  strategic points along the regional transit system. Each TOD has                  a centrally located transit stop and core commercial area; accompanying                  residential and/or employment uses are within an average 2,000                  feet walking distance. The location, design, configuration, and                  mix of uses in a TOD provides an alternative to current suburban                  development trends by emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented environment                  and reinforcing the use of public transportation.                               This                  linkage between land use and transit is designed to result in                  an efficient pattern of development that supports the transit                  system and makes significant progress in reducing sprawl, traffic                  congestion, and air pollution. The TOD's mixed-use clustering                  of land uses within a pedestrian-friendly area connected to transit                  provides for growth with a minimum of environmental and social                  costs.

The            Region and the Community         Oakland            is situated on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay. With a population            of 395,000, Oakland is California's sixth largest city. A thriving port,            an international airport, and major transit facilities have made Oakland            the major hub for commerce, transportation, and international trade            in the Bay Area.                   Oakland            is a diverse community. African Americans and whites are the largest            racial/ethnic groups, with 43 percent and 28 percent of the city's population,            respectively. The other major groups are Asian Americans and Hispanics.            Seventy-two percent of Oakland's population consists of minorities.            Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood, by contrast, is over 90 percent minority,            with Hispanics, Asians, and African Americans representing the neighborhood's            largest population groups.                   Fruitvale            earned its name in the 1800s when German settlers immigrated to the            area to plant fruit orchards. The            community developed a significant manufacturing base anchored by canneries            that served local orchards. Fruitvale became a prosperous neighborhood,            its vibrant business activity earning it a reputation as Oakland's ""second            downtown."" This boom continued through World War II, when the area            experienced an influx of war industry workers, bringing the first significant            numbers of African-American and Hispanic residents to the community.                              Fruitvale's            troubles began during the 1950s, when the construction of new freeways            created opportunities for manufacturers to take advantage of cheap land            and labor in suburban areas. Canneries and factories located in Fruitvale            began leaving the area, accompanied by many of the community's white,            middle-class residents. With the erosion of its customer base, the Fruitvale            business district went into decline. By the 1960s, Fruitvale had become            a distressed neighborhood, plagued by joblessness, inadequate housing,            and other problems characteristic of low-income, inner-city communities.                              In            spite of all this, Fruitvale retained a number of significant assets            that represent potential building blocks for community revitalization.            One such asset was the neighborhood's strong network of community-based            organizations, including the Unity Council. Founded in 1964 by Arabella            Martinez, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health,                   Education            and Welfare under the Jimmy Carter administration, the Unity Council            developed a solid record of success in bringing together residents,            community-based organizations, and businesses to deliver important community            projects. The Unity Council's programs include the development and management            of affordable housing, business assistance, historic preservation, facade            improvements, community festivals, home ownership assistance, job readiness            and employment services, Head Start and Early Head Start child development            programs, the Fruitvale Senior Center, open space development, and environmental            programs.                   The Fruitvale BART Transit    Village is the outgrowth of a growing interest on the part of the Unity Council    in developing a project that would have a large impact on the community of Fruitvale.    According to Arabella Martinez, ""We felt we needed a project of scale,    that a single housing project wasn't going to change the neighborhood.""    The Fruitvale Transit Village presented such an opportunity.

What                  Happened                              When                  BART announced plans in June 1991 to construct a multi-level parking                  facility adjacent to the Fruitvale BART station, the community's                  response was less than enthusiastic. As it was, the area around                  the station was increasingly distressed. The station's crime rate                  was the second highest in the entire BART system. At a public                  meeting organized by BART to present its proposal, community residents                  and business owners complained that the proposed new facility                  would worsen crime and blight, exacerbate existing air quality                  and traffic problems, and cut off pedestrian access from the station                  to the downtown business district.                               The          Unity Council led the opposition to BART's plans. When it became obvious          that the project did not have the support of the Fruitvale community,          BART withdrew its proposal and agreed to work with community leaders on          an alternative plan for the area.                The          vocal and sometimes contentious meetings between BART and community representatives          that followed helped give birth to the idea for the Fruitvale Transit          Village.

In February 1992,                  the City of Oakland awarded the Unity Council $185,000 in Community                  Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to initiate a community planning                  process for revitalizing the area around the Fruitvale BART station.                  That year, the Unity Council held a series of workshops bringing                  together different stakeholder groups from around the community.                                                Impressed                  with the Unity Council's community involvement strategy and ongoing                  progress, the U.S. DOT awarded the agency a $470,000 FTA planning                  grant for the Fruitvale Transit Village in April 1993. The Unity                  Council used the money to conduct a series of community workshops                  and carry out economic, traffic, and engineering studies about                  the immediate station area.                                                       In            May 1993, the Unity Council partnered with the University of California            at Berkeley's National Transit Access Center (UC NTRAC) to sponsor a            community design symposium at which architects translated ideas of participants            into a plan for the station area. One of the main themes articulated            by participants was the need            for revitalization of existing neighborhood businesses and a plan to            better integrate businesses into transit station development. Some 60            people, including Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris and Oakland BART Director            Margaret Pryor, attended the event. This was followed by a series of            community planning meetings to further develop the plan.                   As            the scale of the Transit Village project continued to grow by leaps            and bounds, the project's three central players decided to formalize            their relationship. In 1994, the Unity Council, BART, and the City of            Oakland signed a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the   Fruitvale            Policy Committee   to guide further planning and development activities            at the station. The Policy Committee was a very different approach to            project development for BART and one of several ways that BART exhibited            flexibility and innovation during the planning and design phase of the            project. The Policy Committee members included two representatives from            the Unity Council, one representative from BART, the Mayor of Oakland,            and the city council member representing the Fruitvale district.                                                                     Meanwhile,                  the Unity Council continued to engage in intensive community planning                  efforts for the Fruitvale BART station area. In the spring and                  summer of 1995, the Council organized a series of community site                  planning workshops to help stakeholders reach a consensus on a                  conceptual site plan. At the first workshop, participants were                  asked to identify both positive and negative qualities of the                  Fruitvale community and to indicate their development preferences                  for the Transit Village. Participants identified crime, lack of                  retail businesses and community services, the area's negative                  image, and the lack of connection between the BART station and                  the community as issues of concern. Positive qualities cited included                  the area's diversity and strong tradition of community involvement.                  This workshop attracted about 30 people.                                                Participants at the second workshop were asked to develop more                  specific goals for the Transit Village. Some                  of the goals identified included job creation, improved public                  safety near the BART station, increased availability of retail                  goods and services in the community, provision of high-quality                  affordable housing, and better local air quality. This workshop,                  attended by nearly 50 individuals, also featured a walking tour                  of the site.                                                                                         The                  9-acre BART parking lot will become the site of the Fruitvale                  Transit Village.                                                       At            the third and final workshop, participants were asked to provide feedback            on two alternative land-use plans prepared by the project design team.            Once consensus had been reached on a site plan, the Unity Council initiated            the technical phase of the project, conducting a final traffic study            and financial feasibility studies.                   By            this time, the project components of the Fruitvale Transit Village were            more or less settled. The Village would be located on the existing BART            parking lot, a nine-acre site adjacent to the station. The centerpiece            of the project would be an elegant, tree-lined pedestrian plaza connecting            the BART station entrance with the 12 th  Street business district            one block away. The plaza would be lined with restaurants and shops            and serve as a venue for neighborhood festivals and concerts. The surrounding            area would include a mixture of retail development, housing, and social            service agencies, all easily accessible by foot from the BART station.                                                                                Project                  Chronology                               1991           BART announces          plans to build a multi-level parking facility at the Fruitvale rapid transit          station. The Fruitvale community opposes the project.                               February 1992                    The Unity Council          receives $185,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds to develop          an alternative plan for the station.                               April 1993           The Unity          Council is awarded a $470,000 Federal Transit Administration (FTA) planning          grant.                May 1993            The National          Transit Access Center at UC Berkeley and the Unity Council hold a community          design symposium.                July 1994            The Unity          Council, BART, and City of Oakland sign a Memorandum of Understanding          to form the Fruitvale Policy Committee.                Spring/Summer          1995            The Unity          Council holds a series of community site planning meetings.                1996            The City of          Oakland passes a zoning ordinance capping parking space construction in          the Transit Village area.                1997            The Unity          Council creates the Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC).                1998            The Unity          Council gains control of the Village site through a land swap with BART.                         September 1999                     BART receives          $7.3 million from the FTA to build replacement parking near the Fruitvale          station.                September 1999                     Groundbreaking          for construction of the Fruitvale Transit Village project takes place.                                                                           Architects            translated the ideas from community workshops into a plan for the station            area.                   Overcoming            Barriers.  In 1996, the Unity Council established a nonprofit subsidiary corporation            called the Fruitvale Development Corporation (FDC) to serve as the developer            for the Transit Village and manage contracts. Normally, BART uses a            competitive bidding process to identify developers for projects on BART            properties. However, BART policy allows the agency to                   award            sole-source development rights if such an arrangement is deemed to be            in the best interests of the District. Given the Unity Council's stature            in the Fruitvale community, its success in raising funds for the project,            and BART's participation in the Fruitvale Policy Committee, the BART            Board of Directors acted positively on a staff recommendation to award            the Unity Council an exclusive negotiating agreement for the project.                              By            the mid-1990s, considerable progress had been made on the planning and            design of the Transit Village, yet the project still faced a number            of significant hurdles. Chief among these was the issue of ""land            assembly,"" that is, the need to assemble all parcels of land within            the development site under single ownership. BART still owned much of            the development site and, due to a long-standing policy requiring the            agency to retain ownership of land around transit stations for effective            long-term planning, it could not easily part with the property. The            challenge for the Unity Council was to persuade BART to make an exception            to this policy and accept a fair market price for the property.                                            Transit            Village streetscapes are designed to maximize pedestrian comfort, safety,            and access to local businesses.                   Here            once again, BART exhibited considerable flexibility. The land assembly            problem was addressed in 1998 through a complicated ""land swap""            orchestrated by the Fruitvale Policy Committee, which awarded the FDC            a 96-year lease on the property. In return, BART received a parcel behind            the transit station owned by the Unity Council and several nearby vacant            parcels owned by the City of Oakland, enabling BART to maintain the            existing value of its land holdings in the area. The land swap gave            the FDC and the Unity Council proprietary rights to the entire development            site without reducing the value of BART's land assets near the transit            station.                                                                                                  The                Transit Village plaza will serve as a venue for neighborhood festivals                and concerts.                                                A                  second hurdle was posed by the issue of BART parking capacity                  at the station. BART policy required that every parking spot removed                  for a project be replaced elsewhere. According to Unity Council                  Chief Executive Officer Arabella Martinez, ""the parking was                  a critical issue."" Ultimately, the Unity Council helped negotiate                  an agreement allowing BART to construct a parking garage on property                  owned by Union Pacific Railroad west of the station, replacing                  about 500 lost spaces. In addition, the Unity Council helped BART                  secure a $7.3 million grant from the FTA to construct the new                  facility.                               Finally,                  in order to maintain the pedestrian-oriented character of the                  Transit Village site and to support community preferences for                  less traffic congestion and better air quality, the Unity Council                  petitioned the City of Oakland for a zoning ordinance that would                  ban construction of any additional parking spaces within the area                  around the Transit Village. The City passed the ordinance in 1996.                  In addition, the City agreed to abandon half of the East 12th                  Street right-of-way along the southwest border of the Transit                  Village and narrow the street to one lane.                                                       During            the next several years, the Unity Council and its partners were able            to secure two more significant federal grants to financially anchor            the project. In 1999, BART received $780,000 from the FTA in flexible            funds transferred from the FHWA to construct the pedestrian plaza portion            of the Transit Village. BART was also awarded a $2.3 million grant through            the FTA's  Livable Communities Initiative , which uses sustainable            design concepts such as transit-oriented development to strengthen linkages            between transportation services and communities. This grant provided            funding for construction of the project's child care center, which will            be developed by the Unity Council.                   FDC            architects finished the comprehensive plan for the Fruitvale Transit            Village in 1999, and groundbreaking for the project took place later            that year. To date, FDC has secured over $82 million of public and private            financing for the $100 million venture.                                                                                                                                         Components                        of the Fruitvale Transit Village                                                                                               45,000 ft 2  Retail/Restaurant Use                                                                         54,000 ft 2  Nonprofit Health-Care Clinic                                                                         55,000 ft 2  Child Care Facility                                                                         15,000 ft 2  Library                                                                         45,000 ft 2  Executive Offices                                                                         68 Units of HUD Housing                                                                         220 Units of Mixed-Income Housing                                                                         2 Parking Garages for 1,500 Cars                                                                                                                                        Effective                  Environmental Justice Practices                                                The                  Fruitvale Transit Village represents an innovative strategy for                  using public transit to stimulate community development and achieve                  environmental improvements in a low-income, minority neighborhood.                  The project illustrates a number of effective practices for incorporating                  environmental justice principles into project planning and design:                                                Effective                  Partnerships.  All major development projects face certain legal, regulatory, and financial                  hurdles. However, such obstacles tend to be more pronounced in                  built up urban areas, particularly in less prosperous inner-city                  neighborhoods.                                                                                     Difficulties with land assembly, potential for environmental contamination,                and negative perceptions of such areas on the part of private investors                are just some of the obstacles that development projects in lower-income                central city neighborhoods may face. The Unity Council's success                in negotiating the Fruitvale Transit                Village through a formidable series of hurdles is                due, in large part, to the effective partnership that it entered                into with BART and the City of Oakland, institutionalized with the                establishment of the Fruitvale Policy Committee in 1994. Importantly,                both BART and the City of Oakland stood to gain from their participation                in the project. The City of Oakland anticipated rising property                tax revenues and other benefits associated with new investment activity                in a formerly distressed area, such as job creation and reduction                of crime. BART expected the new development would add from 300 to                600 new daily riders at its Fruitvale station.                                                                           The                  plan for the station area incorporates the community's desire                  for a better connection between the community and the transit                  station.                                                        9                  The            Transit Village will feature a mix of uses - including child care and            other community services, retail, and housing - within easy walking            distance of the BART station.                   Flexibility            and Innovation by Project Partners.  Project            partners acted in creative and sometimes unorthodox ways to overcome            key barriers. BART entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement with            the Unity Council, agreed to a land swap and relocation of its parking            facilities at the Fruitvale station, and worked collaboratively  with             a community on a project initiated  by  the community. The City            of Oakland capped parking in the Transit Village and relinquished a            portion of its right-of-way on East 12 th  Street. The Unity            Council provided the vision for the project, demonstrated effective            leadership, and helped to orchestrate the necessary public support.                              Use            of Creative Financing.  The Unity Council and its partners tapped diverse sources of public and            private funds. For example, a housing complex for seniors is being funded            through a combination of grants, loans, and land and equity capital            from seven different entities, including private banks, the City of            Oakland, a federal housing program, and the Unity Council. Project partners            worked effectively to overcome constraints on the use of certain funds.            For instance, since the Unity Council was not an eligible recipient            of FTA grant funds for construction of the project's child care center,            BART agreed to accept the funds and allocate them to the Unity Council.                              Effective            Public Involvement.   It is noteworthy            that the Fruitvale Transit Village began as a proposal for nothing more            than a simple parking facility, an idea opposed by the community. Without            the strong and sustained public involvement effort that followed BART's            proposal, that would have been the end of the story. The Fruitvale Transit            Village is an unusual development project in the sense that a community-based            organization - the Unity Council - eventually served as the lead agency            and developer for the project. The planning process led by the Unity            Council            featured creative public involvement strategies such as community site            planning meetings, workshops, and a community design symposium. This            process helped to articulate a broad set of concerns focused around            traffic congestion, air pollution, and the need for neighborhood revitalization.            Once such concerns were effectively incorporated into the planning process,            the project moved forward with enthusiastic community support.                   Use            of Transportation Assets as a Community Building Tool.             The Fruitvale Transit Village is based on the proposition that public            transit facilities can be used to stimulate economic development and            promote environmental improvement in a low-income, urban community.            Transit-oriented development, a planning concept that has been used            successfully in various suburban locations, is largely untested in the            inner city. Since central city neighborhoods are often better served            by mass transit than suburban areas, the Fruitvale Transit Village may            hold valuable lessons about the potential for using mass transit as            a tool for the revitalization of low- and moderate-income inner-city            communities.                   Challenges            Ahead                   The            planning and design phase of the Fruitvale Transit Village featured            strong community participation, effective leadership by the Unity Council,            and a willingness on the part of BART authorities to participate in            a community-based planning process. As the project moves into the construction            phase and beyond, a number of key challenges lie ahead:                                                                  The concept of the ""transit village"" should serve as a                guiding principle for future planning and development within the                project area. The investment of substantial amounts of public and                private funds in the immediate vicinity of the Fruitvale BART station                will no doubt spark interest in the area on the part of private                developers, many of whom will have no particular                interest in or commitment to environmental justice, transit-oriented                development, or other project goals. Unless the City of Oakland                continues to work closely with BART and Fruitvale community leaders                to manage future development in the area in accordance with the                transit village concept and the community plan for the area, the                original focus of the project may be lost.                                                                    The Fruitvale Transit Village could become the victim of its own                success if redevelopment activity drives up property values and                property taxes in the surrounding area to the point that existing                residents and businesses are forced out of the community. City officials                and community leaders should be on the lookout for signs of gentrification                and be prepared to work together on a plan to minimize displacement                in the event such steps become necessary. Possible actions include                the capping of property tax increases for long-term residents and                businesses in the area.                                                                    The Fruitvale Transit Village could become a model for additional                transit-oriented development projects serving low-income, minority                communities located along the BART system. Whether or not this occurs                depends to a large extent on the commitment of BART and Bay Area                city officials to pursue such opportunities and the presence of                committed and effective community-based organizations like the Unity                Council in neighborhoods where such projects are viable and appropriate.                                                                                                                         The                planning process for the Fruitvale Transit Village included creative                public involvement strategies such as community site planning meetings,                workshops, and a design symposium.                                                                                                   ""The                  collaboration between the Unity Council, BART, and the City of                  Oakland was the key to the success of this project.""                                    -- Patricia Hirota Cohen                  Senior Real Estate Officer, BART                                                                                                            Lessons            Learned                                                                 Community-based organizations are typically well positioned to identify                community preferences, needs, and concerns. They are often better                equipped than government agencies to determine whether or not a                project is appropriate for a given community and how well it is                likely to be received. The idea for the Fruitvale Transit Village                originated within the Fruitvale community, following a proposal                by BART to construct a parking garage at the Fruitvale BART station.                That proposal generated little community support. To BART's credit,                it changed course quickly once it recognized the community's desire                for a different type of project developed through a more inclusive                planning process.                                                                    Partnerships can be an effective tool for overcoming barriers posed                by the expense and complexity                of certain projects. The Fruitvale Transit Village survived various                legal, financial, and regulatory challenges in large part because                of the leadership of the Unity Council and the willingness of key                players like BART and the City of Oakland to actively participate                in the project.                                                                    Public transit facilities are valuable assets for certain low-income,                minority communities in urban locations. Such facilities already                play an important role in providing inner-city residents with access                to jobs, shopping, and other key destinations. To the extent that                projects like the Fruitvale Transit Village prove successful, transit                facilities may also be used increasingly as anchors for neighborhood                revitalization.

Neighborhood residents and businesses will experience less traffic                    and better air quality as a result of planning efforts emphasizing                    alternatives to automobile use.                                                       New investment activity around the transit station will provide                    jobs, increase property values, improve the appearance of the                    area, and, ideally, transform the commercial core of Fruitvale                    into a convenient and healthy place in which to live, work,                    and shop.

New development around the Fruitvale BART station will lead                    to an increase in the number of transit users passing through                    the station each day, boosting BART's ridership.                                                       Both BART and the City of Oakland have learned valuable lessons                    about the planning and design of transit-oriented development                    projects, knowledge that can potentially be applied at other                    transit stations, both in Oakland and throughout the BART system.

This billion-dollar initiative will strengthen the federal government's role as a partner with the growing number of state and local efforts to build ""livable communities"" for the 21st century. Recognizing that our business is about more than concrete, steel, rail, and rubber, the Federal Transit Administration is completely committed to the use of improved transit in the development of livable communities. As we seek to meet the mobility needs of the American public and commit ourselves to what Secretary Slater refers to as the human dimension of transportation, our Livable Communities Initiative, described in this booklet, equips communities with the tools to develop transit facilities and services that meet their needswith intelligent land use planning, pedestrian access, and urban design. Enhancing personal mobility while building stronger, more vibrant communities will both build transit patronage and improve the quality of life. These community-sensitive facilities make customer information readily available, help customers feel safe and secure, ensure sufficient open space, provide pedestrian and bicycle access, and manage parking carefully. Customer-friendly, community-oriented transit facilities and services don't just happen. They are the result of a coordinated and participatory community-based planning process and people-oriented design. I encourage you to review this booklet thoughtfully and carefully. It will help all of us work together to meet the challenges of tomorrow. Gordon J. Linton   P  REFACE  that walking to and from these facilities requires little effort. Better connections between different modes of transportation are making it easier to transfer from one transportation mode to another. Local governments are implementing transit supportive policies such as mixed-use zoning, parking management, and traffic calming. Additionally, special attention is being given to creating accessible transit for people with disabilities and the elderly, and communities are asking for transit stations and stops which are safer and more secure. This booklet presents some of the successesin terms of planning, development, and implementationof the community-sensitive transportation facility development process. Although a comprehensive process is described here, not every project involves the full range of steps. By applying the techniques outlined in this booklet, transportation agencies, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments, and communities can help achieve transportation goals beyond ""asphalt, concrete, and steel""to reap quality-of-life rewards involving the economic, social and environmental benefits of transit investments. States and local governments are implementing transit supportive policies such as smart growth legislation, mixed-use zoning, parking management, and traffic calming.  A  cross the country, communities are becoming actively involved in enhanc-  ing the connections between transit and local quality of life. This is being accomplished by locating development near transit stops and stations so  1   C  ONTENTS  INTRODUCTION . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 M P P P ETROPOLITAN  PLANNING . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8  ROGRAMMING ROJECT  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21  DEVELOPMENT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 AND  ROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  OPERATIONS  M  AINTENANCE  APPENDIX . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23  TABLES 1. 2. 3. 4.

Metropolitan growth and resulting sprawl development patterns have led to increasingly longer trips, poor pedestrian access, traffic congestion, and adverse environmental impacts. These factors are diminishing the quality of life in the nation's communities and reducing effective and efficient operation of public transportation systems. Transit-oriented development and community-sensitive transit can help reverse these trends. Transit-oriented development  NTRODUCTION densities, suitable job/housing balance, and effective parking management policies can reduce auto trips as much as 18%. Furthermore, developments which incorporate site design amenities (e.g., sidewalks, lights, seats, intermodal connections, and onsite services) can increase transit ridership by 4% or more. In Corpus Christi, Texas, the Regional Transit Authority RTA has experienced a 6% increase in ridership on the routes served by the transit centers, as well as a 19% increase in the systemwide ridership. Current technologies permit implementation of more innovative, efficient, and responsive transit services.  involves mixed-use development on air rights or near transit stations and stops, safe and secure pedestrian access, parking management, and other transit-supportive traffic management techniques. Transit-oriented developments which involve Federal Transit Administration (FTA) financial assistance are defined as joint development. Transit-oriented development can be enhanced with community-sensitive transit consisting of real-time customer information, innovative transit services, on-site customer services, and other amenities. Research has shown that land use strategies involving mixeduse development with higher  FEDERAL TRANSIT  IMPACTS MEASURES Vehicle Trips  OF TRANSIT ORIENTED RESULTS  DEVELOPMENTS  ADMINISTRATION'S LIVABLE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE The FTA Livable Communities Initiative is demonstrating ways to improve the link between transit and communities.

The FTA's Strategic Plan specifically envisions a stronger link in the relationship between transit and communities. Under the Livable Communities Initiative, FTA has awarded funding to 21 projects that demonstrate the characteristics of community-sensitive transit. Demonstration projects were chosen using the criteria shown on Table 1. Table 2 lists the projects and the Appendix provides summary descriptions of each of the selected demonstration projects.  The goal of the Livable Communities Initiative is to strengthen the link between transit and communities by improving personal mobility, transportation system performance, and the quality of life in communities by:  strengthening the link between transit planning and community planning, including land use policies and urban design suppor ting the use of transit, and ultimately providing physi cal assets that better meet community needs;  stimulating increased par ticipation in the decisionmaking process by com munity organizations, minority and low-income residents, small and minor ity businesses, persons with disabilities, and the elderly;  increasing access to employment, education facilities, and other com munity destinations through high quality, community-oriented, and tech nologically innovative tran sit services and facilities; and  leveraging resources avail able through other Feder al, State, and local programs.  secure environment; sufficient pedestrian and bicycle access; and architecture that reflects the values of the community. The Initiative recommends that transportation agencies and local governments introduce proposed transportation improvements to communities in the early stages of the planning process. When communities are afforded an opportunity for greater involvement in the decision-making process, the true objectives of a livable community are more likely to be accurately addressed and achieved. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and FTA strategic plans place emphasis on putting people  EFFECTS OF LAND USE AND URBAN DESIGN TRANSIT MODE SHARE Availability of Convenience Services Mix of Land Use Accessibility of Services Areas Perceived as Safe Aesthetically Pleasing Environment  ON  URBAN DESIGN/LAND USE CHARACTERISTIC IMPACT ON TRANSIT 3.7% increase in transit 3.5% increase in transit 3.3% increase in transit 1.8% increase in transit 4.1% increase in transit  Source: The Effects of Land Use and Travel Demand Management Strategies on Commuting Behavior, November 1994, Cambridge Systematics.  4  I  n t ro d u c t i o n   TABLE 1:  EVALUATING COMMUNITY-SENSITIVE TRANSIT FACILITIES CRITERION COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT  AND SERVICES  CHARACTERISTICS Inclusiveness Town Meetings Planning Workshops Design Workshops  R  ESULTS  Supportive of transit Better problem definitions Consensus on alternatives Better project definition  ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFECTS  Transit-Oriented Comprehensive Plan Catalyst for revitalization Employment Creation Job increase Local Property Tax Base Increased property values Additional Indirect Effects Source of non-farebox revenues Transit-Oriented Development Increased transit ridership Efficient land use management Reduced auto trips Improved transit operations Increased transit modal shar e Allocation of funding requirements Prioritization of scarce resources Transit agency income Risk management Reduction in crime and accidents Improved time management Travel time savings Operating efficiency Neighborhood/historical preservation Trip reductions Aesthetically pleasing environment Improved access to services Better functional relationships Greater operations efficiency Increased mobility Greater pedestrian movement Better line haul access Improved access In-vehicle travel time savings Improved network efficiency Increased work and non-work transit trips Percent transit ridership Improved air quality, reduced VMT  LOCAL LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION POLICIES  Transit Priority Treatments Parking Management PROJECT FINANCIAL IMPACTS Project Cost Optimizing Fund Sources Project Revenues Leveraging Other Financial Resources Safety/Security Provisions Customer Information Travel Time Speeds Architectural Compatibility Mix of Land Uses Art Local Master Plan Integration Facility Design Integration Transit Stop Location Intermodal Connections Pedestrian Access Transit Vehicle Circulation Bicycle Access Signal Preemption Access Roadway Congestion Levels Transit Usage Transit Mode Shar e Travel Demand Management  QUALITY OF SERVICE  SITE DESIGN PRINCIPLES  SYSTEM ACCESS  TRAVEL DEMAND  I  ntroduction  5   TABLE 2:  LCI DEMONSTRATION PROJECT SUMMARY LCI DEMONSTRATION PROJECT PRINCIPAL FEATURE TOTAL PROJECT COST FTA SHARE (millions) (millions)  Atlanta University Center Access Improvements Austin Baltimore Reisterstown Metr o Station Enhancements Chester Transportation Center Enhancements Chicago Green Line 35th Street Station Enhancements Clackamas County Sunnyside Village Transit Plaza Columbus Engineering for Transit Service Center Corpus Christi Transit Center Dallas Pedestrian Accessway Enhancements East Cleveland - Enhancements to Stokes Station at Windermer e El Paso Union Plaza Pedestrian Enhancements Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiatives (LANI) Transit Enhancements Louisville Neighborhood Travel and Jobs Center New York City Harlem 110th St. Station Security Oakland BART Fruitvale Station Enhancements North Philadelphia Pedestrian Access Improvements Peublo Downtown Transit Center Rosslyn Metro Station Bus Bay, Pedestrian Access and Safety St. Louis Metrolink Wellston Station Enhancements Tampa Ybor City Electric Trolley Access Improvements Tucson South Park Avenue Improvements  Pedestrian Access Pedestrian and Bus Access Customer Services Pedestrian and Bus Access, Customer Services Pedestrian Access, Safety, and Security Land Acquisition Engineering and Architectural Design Pedestrian Access Pedestrian Access Land Acquisition Bus and Pedestrian Access/Safety Safety and Security Features, Bus Shelters, Transit Stores Building Acquisition and Customer Services Safety and Security Enhancements Transit-Oriented Development Pedestrian Access Safety and Security Enhancements Facility Improvements, Bus Access Customer Services Enhancements System and Pedestrian Enhancements Pedestrian Access  $10.00 $1.25 $1.90 $7.50 $3.36 $2.00 $10.001 $3.72 $1.31 $6.00 $30.00 $7.40 $3.00 $2.80 $4.50 $5.70 $1.70 $1.62 $7.80 $4.74 $1.80  $3.10 $1.00 $1.52 $6.00 $2.80 $1.60 $2.50 $3.10 $1.09 $3.20 $7.50 $5.30 $2.40 $2.20 $2.30 $3.00 $1.00 $1.30 $1.00 $1.70 $1.50  TOTAL  $118.10 $55.11  6  I  n t ro d u c t i o n   STATUTORY BASIS AND FUNDING The statutory basis for the Initiative is found at 49 U.S.C. Section 5309(a)(5) and (7) (formerly Sections 3(a)(1)(D) and (F) of the Federal Transit Act). These provisions authorize projects that 1) enhance the effectiveness of mass transportation projects to which they are physically or functionally related, and 2) provide non-vehicular, capital improvements which increase transit ridership in fixedguideway corridors. The flexible funding provisions of TEA-21 strengthen the funding opportunities for transit investments that meet the needs of communities. The FTA Livable Communities Initiative is thus firmly grounded in law. The essential purpose of the Federal transit law is not simply to fund the capital and operating costs of transit systems; more generally, the purpose is to improve the quality of life in urban and rural communities through the use of transit systems, recognizing them as the lifeblood of livable communities.  The Clinton-Gore Livability Agenda is a billion dollar initiative. Sources of Federal funds for projects reflecting the basic principles of the Livable Communities Initiative include: the Transit Capital Discretionary Grant or Loan Program, the Transit Formula Assistance Block Grants, the Planning and Research Program, the Planning and Design of Mass Transportation Facilities to Meet Special Needs of Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities, the Rural Transit Assistance Formula Grant Program for Areas Other Than Urbanized Areas, the Surface Transportation Program (STP), and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds. Livable communities do not simply happen. They are the byproduct of a coordinated and participatory transportation and community planning process where transit decisions are made in conjunction with decisions on land use and other transportation investments. The principles of livable communities should be instilled throughout the planning and project development process.  A description of that process and the kinds of principles that are appropriate at each stage follows.  STEPS IN PLANNING AND PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS METROPOLITAN PLANNING  PROGRAMMING  PROJECT DEVELOPMENT  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION  OPERATIONS & MAINTENANCE  I  n t ro d u c t i o n  7   M  ETROPOLITAN PLANNING In urbanized areas around the country, local elected officials and transportation agencies carry out transportation planning and decision-making processes. The planning process produces a transportation plan, identifying the region's transportation policies, investment strategies, and major facilities and services to be implemented during the next 20 or more years. The process also produces a short range transportation improvement program (TIP), which identifies the projects to be implemented over a shorter (generally 3- to 5-year) period. The process is carried out under the auspices of a Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). MPOs have the authority to adopt plans and TIPs, but most do not implement transportation projects, provide transportation services, or regulate land use. Some of the activities that occur as part of the metropolitan transportation planning process are:  Analysis of transportation system performance and trends;  Projections of future land use, travel, and system performance;  Analysis of alternative strategies for solving transportation problems; and  Involvement of the public and non-transportation agencies (see Table 3 for examples of techniques). There are numerous opportunities to incorporate livable communities principles into the metropolitan transportation planning process. Metropolitan planning leads to decisions, by the MPO and participating implementing agencies, on transportation plans, policies, and priorities. Under Federal law and regulations, metropolitan transportation plans must be relatively specific, must be consistent with reasonable forecasts of revenue, and must be in conformance with air quality plans. In addition, the planning process must take land use and development plans and  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES CONCEPTS METROPOLITAN PLANNING:  IN   Regional transportation policies developed by the MPO might call for high density, mixed use development with good pedestrian access at places with good transit accessibility, such as transit stations.  The travel demand models that are used to predict future travel behavior can be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to make them more sensitive to the tripmaking characteristics of mixed use, transit-friendly communities.  Alternative land use plans and policies can be evaluated in a longrange plan, as a strategy, or as part of a strategy, for addressing transportation problems.  The criteria used to evaluate alternative transportation strategies and to set priorities can favor projects that are supportive of transitfriendly communities.  MPOs can carry out planning studies to help identify areas within the metropolitan region that are suitable for development as livable communities. Or, MPOs can develop regional guidelines or sample ordinances to help local governments establish livable communities programs.  A community involvement program that stimulates increased participation by community organizations and residents, minority and low-income residents, small and minority businesses, persons with disabilities, and the elderly is essential to adequately consider land use and the overall social, economic, energy, and environmental effects of transportation decisions.  8   TABLE 3:  TECHNIQUES  FOR PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT  FUNDING AGENCIES ARE EXPECTED TO ADOPT TECHNIQUES FOR ENCOURAGING PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. BELOW ARE SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR AND EFFECTIVE INNOVATIONS IN PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT FOR TRANSPORTATION PLANNING.   Charrette  a meeting in which citizens are invited to participate in a full discussion of issues, inter relationships, and impacts. Time limits challenge people to openly examine problems and produce tangible results.  Visioning  a series of meetings open to all citizens or a representative panel focusing on long-range issues that eventually lead to a goals statement.  Brainstorming  a democratic process open to any citizen, led by a facilitator or moderator where participants come together in a freethinking forum to generate ideas. It provides participants with a sense of progress and accomplishments, and helps them move on to more difficult tasks.  Citizen's Advisory Committee  a repr esentative group of stakeholders that meets regularly to discuss issues of common concern. It allows for extended interaction between citizens and their government.  Transportation Fair  a one-day event used to interest citizens in transportation and in specific projects or programs.  Focus Groups  a meeting of a carefully selected group of individuals convened to discuss a single topic. The opinions are used to gauge public opinion.   Collaborative Task Force  a group of individuals selected to come to a conclusion and resolve a difficult issue, subject to ratification by official decisionmakers.  Media Strategies  use of print and broadcast vehicles to advise and inform customers about projects and programs.  Facilitation  a neutral facilitator guides a group of citizen representatives through the problem-solving process.  Citizen Surveys  a survey administered to a sample group of citizens via a written questionnaire or through interviews in person, by phone, or by electronic mail. The tabulated results are considered representative of a larger group.  Telephone Techniques  an interactive medium used to solicit public involvement, obtain information, and get opinions.  Visual Techniques  use of recorded visual and oral messages to present information to the public, e.g., Visual Preference Surveys.  Public Meetings/Hearings  held prior to a decision point, it presents information to the public and obtains formal input from citizens.  M  e t r o p o l i t a n Pl a n n i n g  9   social, economic, and environmental impacts into account. Some metropolitan planning activities occur on a regional scale. For example, forecasts of future population and employment are normally produced for the region as a whole, reflecting regional growth and development expectations. Policies on desirable transportation system performance, highway and transit service levels, pricing, and finance are typically arrived at on a regional basis. Other planning activities focus on major transportation problems within the region. In most metropolitan areas, the planning and regulation of land use and urban development are the responsibility of individual political jurisdictions. Since transportation planning takes place at the regional level, and land use responsibilities at the local jurisdiction level, the coordination of transportation and land use planning can be difficult. However, the same elected officials who sit on MPO policy boards often have responsibility within their local jurisdictions for land use decisions like comprehensive planning, zoning, and subdivision controls.  Thus, there is linkage through which plans and policies developed at the regional level can be adopted and implemented by the local jurisdictions participating in the MPO planning process. Livable community principles can also be implemented through the planning and land use control  mechanisms of local jurisdictions in the following ways:  Active and diverse community involvement in the metropolitan planning process.  Local comprehensive land use plans can call for new development to be concentrated in corridors where high quality transit service exists or is planned.  FEDERAL PROGRAM SUPPORTS COORDINATED LAND USE AND TRANSPORTATION PLANNING The Federal Transit Administration is cur rently participating in a program that compliments the Livable Communities Initiative by providing grants to local and state governments that are improving access to jobs, services, and centers of trade. The Transportation and Community and System Preservation Pilot Program (TCSP) supports joint transportation and land use planning projects that address five goals: improve the efficiency of the transportation system; reduce the future cost of transportation infrastructure; provide efficient access to jobs, activities, and business centers; reduce the environmental impacts of transportation; and examine patterns of private sector development. FTA is part of a working group that includes the Federal Railroad Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Federal Highway Administration. In May of 1999, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater awarded $13.1 million for 35 projects that support innovative local and regional transportation efforts. Projects range from investigating the impacts of transit overlay districts to preparing modern intermodal freight infrastructure in support of the economic development of brownfield sites.  10  M  e t r o p o l i t a n P l an n i n g    Local plans may call for high density, mixed use development with good pedestrian access at places with good transit accessibility, such as transit stations.  Local zoning ordinances may be revised to provide incentives for mixed use, transit friendly developments. Such incentives might include reduced parking requirements, reduced set back requirements, or higher floor area ratios.   Zoning ordinances might promote transit friendly design by requiring sidewalks or by placing off-street parking to the rear of buildings.  QUALITY COMMUNITY SURVEYS: MARYLAND'S APPROACH TO INVOLVING CITIZENS AND OFFICIALS IN DEVELOPING SMART GROWTH STRATEGIES At the heart of Maryland's emphasis on Smart Growth is the belief that progress toward the building of ""Quality Communities"" requires deliberate, goal-oriented planning and decision-making at the local level. Along with other states across the country, Maryland recognized that effective responses to sprawl must include vigorous efforts to enhance the quality of life in existing urban communities. If such communities can offer current and prospective residents an attractive, safe, nurturing environment in which to live and work, fewer Marylanders would elect to leave those communities to populate new neighborhoods at the edge of suburban development. But quality communities do not happen be accident; they are the result of careful planning, hard work, public involvement, local support and continuing investment. Through a special partnership with the Federal Transit Administration's Livable Communities Initiative, the Maryland Mass Transit Administration (MTA) worked with ten Maryland communities from early 1997 through early 1999 to develop and apply the Quality Community Survey (QCS) approach. This approach to planning and community involvement employs public workshops using a technique called ""vision translation."" In advance of each QCS session, MTA planners met with local citizens and elected officials to identify issues that were felt to be critical to the future of each community. These meetings included tours and photo sessions to record and assess existing quality-of-life conditions in the communities. During the workshop itself, community members explore options for enhancement actions using the vision translation method. This interesting and popular process has repeatedly proven its usefulness in helping residents and officials develop consensus on concrete actions needed to create and sustain quality communities.

Projects determined to be of highest priority are programmed via a metropolitan and a statewide Transportation Improvement Program (TIP). TIPs usually  cover 3-5 years. The Metropolitan TIP is approved by the MPO and the State TIP (STIP) is approved by the state's Governor. The annual element of the statewide TIP must be approved by the FHWA and the FTA before financial assistance is provided. These programs are to be prioritized and constrained to reasonably available revenues. Each state and metropolitan area has a process for periodically amending its TIPs to incorporate new projects. If the states and the MPOs wish to program community-sensitive transit projects, the criteria in Table 1, or those determined locally, can be used to evaluate those projects. An example of such local programming initiative is the Delta Area Rural Transit System (DARTS) in Clarksdale, Mississippi. DARTS was launched in 1990 by a local health center with two minivans purchased by the federal  EL PASO FLEXIBLE FUNDING FOR TRANSITORIENTED DEVELOPMENT - A GOOD NEWS STORY In El Paso, Texas, Sun Metro is undertaking a major Transit Improvement Program known as Union Plaza that will redefine and revitalize the El Paso Empowerment Zone using over $30M in flexible funding.

Transit oriented development is the key to making this redevelopment program work.  LEVERAGING OTHER FUNDS Numerous leveraging opportunities exist for facilities which provide onsite community services, incorporate other transportation enhancements, and accommodate transit-oriented real estate development. Transit enhancements envisioned by the Livable Communities Initiative are typically part of larger funding packages. These opportunities occur, for example, in the form of funding from TEA21's flexible funding programs, foundations, the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  12   SMART GROWTH AND TRANSIT: A PROMISING PARTNERSHIP The growing national interest in the Smart Growth concept, together with the success of the Livable Communities Initiative in forging linkages between transit improvements and community development activities, suggests a wide panorama of new opportunities to achieve permanent changes in urban development patterns. Smart Growth is a local phenomenon and, like the Livable Communities Initiative, derives its energy and momentum from partnerships among key participants at the local level-developers, planners, transit agencies, citizens, and public officials, working together. Under such conditions, growth becomes an opportunity to harness the power of the market to bring a positive reshaping influence to the geographic distribution of population and jobs. As we look at the problems created by sprawl and the need to revitalize our urban cores and protect our rural communities, we must real ize that sprawl creates a quality of life deficit, expressed in terms of, among other things, mobility deficiencies. Transit improvements, when undertaken in conjunction with other key components of community quality of life, can provide an important catalyst and for the implementation of Smart Growth policies.   In Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) used its Livable Communities Initiative demonstration grant to leverage an additional $2 million in foundation funding for a $6 million East Cleveland Windermere Station Head Start and extended day care project.  Missouri's Bi-State Transit Development Agency and the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council are using a Livable Communities Initiative demonstration grant in conjunction with local brownfields redevelopment activities. This grant is being coordinated with a broader, $6 million funding package provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce and a donation of training equipment provided by the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences.

Along with actual projects, MPOs and transit agencies are encouraged to program planning studies supportive of the Livable Communities Initiative in their area's Unified Planning Work Programs. As an illustration, in Oakland, California, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, the MPO, worked with the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) and the Spanish Speaking Unity Council, a neighborhood organization, to program planning funds for developing a site plan for the BART Fruitvale Station Transit Village.

In accordance with the goal of the Livable Communities Initiative, FTA encourages transit agencies to seek, early on, active community involvement in project developJOB ACCESS AND REVERSE COMMUTE Transportation is considered crucial in welfare reform. Public transportation has a pivotal role in the journey from welfare to work. To the nearly 40% of the 10 million daily public transit riders in the U.S., transit is more than merely a ride-it is a lifeline. Congress has authorized $750m, with $500M guaranteed for this program under TEA-21.  further project development work is undertaken to examine the pro-  posal in greater detail. Project development includes the analysis of design options like the precise location, physical dimensions, architectural treatments, and access of new transit facilities or enhancements to existing facilities. During this phase, the environmental review process is completed, including the preparation of any environmental documents that may be required. These requirements are described in the FTA/FHWA Joint Environmental Procedures (CFR771). Cost estimates are also refined, along with financial commitments. Project development activities are normally carried out by the agency that will be responsible for implementation and operation.  EARLY AND ACTIVE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PHASE ENSURES COMMUNITY-RESPONSIVE PROJECT ELEMENTS In San Francisco, a light rail system is being developed for the Bayshore Corridor with intensive public involvement to ensure that the project meets community needs. Major issues addressed included how to successfully integrate the rail system into an area where major redevelopment efforts are planned and the provision of transit service that will best connect the corridor to the rest of the city. To accomplish this, peer panel meetings were conducted with involvement of community representatives and nationally recognized transportation experts. Topics discussed included cur rent stateof-the-art in assessment of pedestrian access, tools and processes for community decisionmaking, land use impacts around stations and stops, micro-scale transit demand estimation, and the use of Geographic Information Sys tems (GIS) in analysis.  14   ment such as occurred in the San Francisco Bayshore Corridor. The process for developing community-sensitive transit facilities will vary depending upon the type and scale of the project. Projects proceed through the phases of preliminary engineering (PE), final design, and construction.  Enhancements to existing stations and stops may involve site planning and facility design without a clear demarcation between PE and final design. Preliminary engineering is where site plans or station area plans are developed, facilities are designed to the 30% level, cost estimates are prepared, and, US  if needed, environmental documents are completed. For major investments, inputs to PE include project design concept and scope, travel demand estimates, master schedules, and budgets. Changes in project definition and operations requirements are incorporated during the PE phase.  FTA ADVANCES IMPLEMENTATION OF B THROUGH DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM  RAPID T  RANSIT  The design of communitysensitive transit facilities is greatly facilitated by an engaged, actively participating community, as illustrated by the site planning and design for rehabilitation of the Chester Transportation Center. Techniques such as the Visual Preference Survey, focus groups, and HandsOn Model Building Workshops are excellent methods for building community consensus during project development. Project development is normally where issues associated with FTAsupported transit-oriented development are addressed.  While livable communities projects seek to strengthen the link between transit and community, other initiatives underway will enhance mobility and transit efficiency through service improvements. For example, FTA recently launched the Bus Rapid Transit Initiative to improve the speed, reliability, and convenience of bus service while enhancing mobility and minimizing environmental impacts. Central to the Initiative is a Demonstration Program that will support bus rapid transit innovations at ten selected locations throughout the United States. The improvements funded through this Initiative will explore ways in which buses can operate with the speed, reliability, and efficiency of light rail at only a fraction of the cost. Bus rapid transit offers many of the features of a subway system--unimpeded vehicle movements, efficient fare collection, quick loading, and reliable service--but above-ground and visible. These advancements are possible through the use of dedicated bus lanes or bus streets; engineering improvements such as bus turnouts and traffic signal preference and preemption at intersections; and enclosed bus-level boarding areas that allow passengers to pay fares prior to entering the bus. The Demonstration Program will support implementation of bus rapid transit in ten cities, including Boston, MA; San Juan, PR; Eugene, OR; and Honolulu, HI. Funded projects include improvements to existing bus service, replacement service for discontinued light rail services, and intermediate service prior to extension of light rail. Careful documentation and analysis of each program will illustrate key lessons that can be applied to the implementation of bus rapid transit elsewhere.  P r o j ec t D e ve l o p me n t  15   INNOVATIVE PLANNING TECHNIQUE LEADS TO DESIGN THAT MEETS COMMUNITY NEEDS The expectations and needs of a community must be reflected in the design of each project. At a transportation town meeting in Corpus Christi, Texas, over 150 neighborhood residents, agency representatives, elected officials and interested individuals met to exchange ideas for improving pedestrian and transit access from the award-winning Staples Street Transit Center to the Northside Community. A series of visual representations of design options were shown to assess the relative values of the group and to begin establishing community priorities. Knowing the community's priorities helped define not only the access improvements but also the customer safety and security enhancements to be made.  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES CONCEPTS FOR PROJECT DEVELOPMENT:  Involve intensive community participation  Accommodate transit-oriented development  Locate transit station convenient to surrounding development, minimizing walking distance and avoiding hostile pedestrian environments  Plan for an appropriate intensity of uses in the station area and along transit corridors  Identify joint development opportunities, including integration of community facilities--such as day care centers--into transit stations  Build in flexibility for future joint development (e.g., onsite services such as child care, health care, transit operator training facility, etc.) as the community's needs evolve  Provide a sense of arrival, order, and orientation within the station area  Balance architectural variety with overall consistency  Mitigate adverse environmental impacts and replace lost resources such as parks grantees should refer to the FTA Grant Management Guidelines (FTA Circular 5010.lB), the Capital Program: Grant Application Instructions (FTA Circular 9300.1), and the FTA Policy on Joint Develland for nearby real estate development; preparing land for development (Federal Register, Friday March 14, 1997; Vol. 62, No. 50, Pages 12266 to 12269).

FTA has determined that such revenue is Program Income, usable for any eligible transit purpose. 6. Producing suppor tive land use poli cies, urban design guidelines, and transportation man agement strategies to increase transit ridership: FTA is encouraging local gov ernments, transporta tion agencies, employ ers, building owners, and building managers to work together in implementing policies and strategies that will support transit utiliza tion. Supportive land use policies include promoting mixed use and high density devel opment around transit stations. Urban design enhancements include landscaping, pedestri an and bicycle ameni ties, safety and security improvements, and improved access to transit services. Transportation actions include parking man agement strategies to increase the cost and reduce the number of parking spaces for sin gle occupant vehicles, priority treatments for transit vehicles, and transit pass programs. 7. Joint Development Agreement: Joint development agree ments address a num ber of issues including institutional arrange ments such as revenues to be paid to transit operators, use of pr oceeds, land acquisi tions, project financ ing, and the extent of Federal participation. Also, cost-sharing arrangements are to be considered whether they are voluntar y, incentive-based, or mandatory. 8. Cross-Cutting Feder al Requirements and Executive Orders: Projects that have a Federal interest must comply with statutory and regulato ry requirements under Federal Transit and related laws, including the National Environ mental Policy Act, Civil Rights, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Clean Air Act, Com mon Grant Rule, and other Federal cross-cut ting requirements, including Davis Bacon, Buy America, thir d party contracting and 13(c). Such projects should also comply with Executive Orders on Infrastructur e Investment and Envi ronmental Justice. Decisions on whether these requirements apply will be made on a case by case basis. Flexibility will be allowed as appropriate.  1. Establishing the physical or func tional relationship to transit: Each pr oject should establish the link between transit and the proposed commu nity-oriented project, be it a child care cen ter, health care facility, mixed-use develop ment or retail facility. Issues to be considered include travel time between the community services and the transit facility, trip generation rates of the proposed community development, and transit share of those trips. 2. Coordinating the site and functional plans, particularly in relationship to transit facility oper ation and mainte nance so as to avoid non-incidental uses: Major trip generators like housing complex es, hotels, and office buildings may be defined as incidental uses. However, because of their scale and potential for obstruct ing transit access, or causing safety prob lems, an incidental use determination for these major generators would be made on a case-by-case basis. 3. Program Income: Most importantly, TEA21presumes that the transit operator will recover the reasonable cost of a joint develop -  4. Designing transit and related services in an integrated manner: It is impor tant that the architec tural, structural, mechanical and electri cal systems for the transit facility are com patible with the requirements of other anticipated uses. These and other aspects of the transit facility infra structure should be adequately designed to accommodate the needs of community oriented enterprises such as health and day care, retail, financial, recreation and educa tional facilities which may be incorporated into the facility. 5. Determining the market and financial feasibility of the transit-related components: If community facilities ar e included in a proposal, market and financial feasibility need to be established to insur e successful implementation and operation of the project. This will include some analysis of the potential demand for the ser vices and the likelihood that the space will be occupied.

To address this situation, the DTPW used flexible funding to design and develop an accessible beach facility at Luguillo Beach, located on the east coast of Puerto Rico. This innovative and fully accessible project is called Mar Sin Barrera, or Sea Without Barriers. The transit agency--the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority--provides service to this attractive beach facility with specially equipped paratransit vehicles.  18   SUCCESS OF LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY EFFORT LEADS TO BECOMING NATIONAL COMMUNITYINVOLVEMENT MODEL The Los Angeles Neighborhood Initiative (LANI), an eight-neighborhood coalition, is working with the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) to make community-recom mended transit enhancements. This coalition is serving as a national model for community involvement in the planning and implementation of transportation improvements. LANI recognized the vital role of transportation to the economic, social, and environmental well-being of communities. installing, and testing; and systems. Effective construction management requires a clear definition of objectives, well-defined team roles and responsibilities, requirements and procedures for coordination, a promulgated management plan, and a dispute resolution process. Generally, a project manager assumes overall responsibility for cost and schedule. Design support is required daily. Testing, inspection and quality assurance, change order approval controls, invoices, and submittals are required of the contractor. The project manager handles third party issues, specifically public inquires and negotiations of approvals from public agencies and utilities. The project manager also addresses systems elements, management controls, and financial/budget controls. Effective communication is of paramount importance during the construction phase. Throughout the process, communication with the affected community plays a key part in the success of any project. Newsletters, community meetings, town hall meetings, project milestone celebrations, and other special events are effective tools for maintaining contact with neighborhood groups and citizens. Public notices and information about transit routes, schedules, and other customer information should be prepared, distributed, and posted well in advance of startup. Staging an open house at a transit center/station or its adjoining community facility provides a good welcoming and orientation to the neighborhood.  P  r o je ct  I  mplementation  19   Project sponsors are encouraged to pursue innovative project delivery approaches where feasible or where market conditions permit. In some cases, a turnkey or design/build approach may save time and budget. Turnkey is where the design and construction activities are contained in a  single contract. Joint development with private developers, who may handle finance, engineering, and construction, is another possibility.  LIVABLE COMMUNITIES GRANT MOVES COMMUNITY DRIVEN GRANT FROM PLANNING PHASE TO DESIGN DEVELOPMENT In New York City, citizens have been participating in the redesign of Frederick Douglass Circle, located at the northwest corner of Central Park. A series of meetings, workshops, and exhibits sponsored by the Central Park Conservancy have explored ways to revitalize this busy and neglected interesection. During the process, participants sought to make the circle more pedestrian-friendly, improve access to bus and subway stops, and strengthen the intersection's role as a gateway to Central Park and three surrounding neighborhoods. Partici pants also suggested ways to incorporate elements depicting the life of Frederick Douglass into the design of the area. A recent $140,000 Livable Communities grant from FTA has provided the funds to move the process from planning to design development. The project is progressing as a public-private partnership between the Central Park Conservancy and City agencies, and will incorporate new traffic signals, crosswalks, pedestrian lighting, a monument to Douglass, and urban design elements that will encourage future retail and commercial development around the Circle. The project is progressing as a public-private partnership between the Central Park Conservancy and City agencies, with Federal funding being provided by the Federal Highway Department.

Although these responsibilities become paramount after the facility is open and in use, operations and maintenance requirements should be addressed early on in the planning and project development phases. Proper operations and maintenance are essential to safeguard the initial investment and to achieve the use of facilities. In recently completed community-sensitive transportation projects, a number of innovative approaches to operations and maintenance are presented. In Corpus Christi, Texas, over 1,500 community members created colorful ceramic tiles for the awardwinning Staples Street bus transfer center. This direct community participation reduced litter and graffiti, and maintenance costs are significantly lower than at other transit stations. By employing off-duty city police officers, the Transit Authority is able to provide quality customer security at a lower cost.

The master lease even put in electrical services as part of the agreement.  negotiated, annual fee to the Mall for cleaning and maintenance of the bus transfer center. In each case, the SCMTD has significantly reduced the operating and maintenance costs. Community-sensitive transit projects provide special opportunities for community stewardship. Community stewardship of transit stations and centers provides a sense of community ownership  While stewardship can be applied at many transit facilities, the approach may vary based upon the facility, the location, and community interest. However, the partnerships created between transit and neighborhoods through the Livable Communities Initiative provide an ongoing basis for community stewardship, thus alleviating many operating and maintenance difficulties.  P  ro j ec t  I  mplementation  21   T  he Livable Communities Initiative is demonstrating that transit can provide an important means of strengthening the link between transportation and communities. This booklet has described how the concepts and objectives of the FTA Livable Communities Initiative are incorporated into the ongoing  planning, programming, project development, and project implementation processes. Examples were used to  illustrate these phases, as well as operations and maintenance aspects. The FTA Livable Communities Initiative involves a number of other activities. These include:  Documentation of Best Practices in planning, developing, implementing, and operating community-sensitive transit facilities.
