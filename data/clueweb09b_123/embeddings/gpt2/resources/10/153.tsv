Congress Avenue      Austin, Texas 78701      Phone :(512) 463-9455      Fax: (512) 305-8920             A CALL FOR EXCELLENCE:     RAISING THE BAR      FOR GIFTED STUDENTS         Texas Education Agency     January 15, 1999         A Call for Excellence: Raising the Bar for Gifted Students     Building on the past.  Throughout the United States, there has been a call for   America's students to master more complex skills and to demonstrate understanding of more   sophisticated content. In response, states throughout the country have increased their   expectations for student performance. However, while basic competencies are being raised,   often there is little done to enhance services for more advanced learners.  National   Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent,  published by the United States   Department of Education in 1993, notes that, ""Most American students are encouraged   to finish high school and earn good grades. But students are not asked to work hard or   master a body of challenging knowledge or skills. The message society often sends to   students is to aim for academic  adequacy , not academic  excellence    (p.1).""     In 1995 when the Texas Legislature passed Senate Bill 1, it created a new education   code with a new set of expectations for children that met the challenge implied in  National   Excellence . The law required that a new curriculum be developed that established what   knowledge and skills all students should achieve at each grade level. It also established   a new set of ""Public Education Academic Goals"" for the state. These goals   mandate that students should perform at exemplary levels in language arts, mathematics,   social studies, and science (Section 4.002, TEC). Taken together, the new curriculum and   the new goals promised that all students would receive a more challenging educational   program.     Senate Bill 1 did not stop there. It also redrafted the laws relating to the   state-mandated program for gifted students. The Texas Legislature had provided funding for   programs to gifted students on a voluntary basis since 1979. In 1987 it had mandated that   all districts must provide services to gifted students by the beginning of the 1990 school   year. Prior to 1995, however, although services for advanced students were required in all   districts, there was no oversight provided by the Texas Education Agency. According to   Section 29.123 of the Texas Education Code, the State Board of Education now is charged   with developing and updating ""a state plan for the education of gifted and talented   students to guide school districts in establishing and improving programs for identified   students."" Additionally, and most importantly, the plan is to ""be used for   accountability purposes  to measure the performance of districts  in providing   services to students identified as gifted and talented (29.123, TEC).""      The new plan, which was adopted in November 1996, was designed to meet the two charges   included in the law-it created criteria to be used for accountability of services for   gifted students, and it provided guidance on how to improve those services. The plan   provided an acceptable level of services that all districts must meet. At the same time,   it also established criteria that districts could strive to attain at a   ""recognized"" and ""exemplary"" level that raised the bar both for the   expansiveness of services provided to/for gifted students and on the level of student   performance. In keeping with Senate Bill 1, which encourages local control, the additional   levels above acceptable are voluntary on the part of districts and not a requirement of   state law or rule. Each level of the plan builds on the previous one-districts must meet   the acceptable level in order to adequately address the recognized level, which, in turn,   must be met if a district is to meet the standards at the exemplary level. As an example   of this, at the acceptable level, all teachers who provide services in the gifted program   must receive a minimum of 30 clock hours of professional development in the field   (indicator 4.1A). Indicator 4.1.1R states that teachers are encouraged to pursue advanced   degrees in their teaching discipline. The exemplary indicator, 4.1E, requires that   districts provide support for teachers to receive their endorsement in the area of gifted   education. A copy of the state plan is included in Appendix A.     Even at the acceptable level, which is a requirement of all districts, the new plan   expanded services in the following ways.        It requires that all districts offer services that emphasize content in the four     foundation areas of the curriculum.  In the past, districts could select to serve     students in one area-language arts for example-and ignore other areas of the curriculum.     Because the academic goals for public education outlined in Section 4.002 of the Texas     Education Code state that students perform at exemplary levels in language arts,     mathematics, social studies, and science, it is critical that services to gifted students     support these goals by addressing the four foundation areas. At the recognized and     exemplary level, the state plan encourages districts to expand their services to areas of     the arts, leadership, and creative endeavors.       The plan requires that districts provide a continuum of learning experiences that     lead to the development of advanced-level products/performances.  Prior to the adoption     of the plan in 1996, there were no requirements related to student performance for those     who participated in services for gifted students. Too often, detractors of services for     gifted students could turn to programs that did not have rigor, did not require effort,     and did not set high expectations for students. Even those who actively support gifted     education have admitted that the effort to get into gifted programs far exceeds, in some     cases, the effort needed to participate in those programs. The plan's goal focuses on     student performance by stating that students who participate in services that are part of     the gifted program will develop ""innovative products and performances that reflect     individuality and creativity and are advanced in relation to students of similar age,     experience, or environment. High school students who have participated in services for     gifted students will have produced products and performance of professional quality as     part of their program services (p.1)."" This goal clearly focuses district efforts on     what students are learning and accomplishing, thereby addressing a major concern related     to gifted education.       The concept of high school students producing products of professional quality may seem     beyond the reach of most students, and, indeed, it may be. However, it should be the goal     of those who either teach or are taught at an advanced level. The purpose of gifted     programs is not simply to get in them but to provide challenging curricular options that     demand effort and high performance.  National Excellence  suggested that there is a     pervasive ambivalence in America toward high intellectual achievement. The report notes     that high-ability students receive mixed messages. ""Negative stereotypes of     high-achieving students have created an atmosphere in which students do not want to be     identified as very smartâ€¦Students say they want to do well, but not exceptionally     well, because it is more important to be accepted by the popular students than it is to be     considered a 'brain'."" (p. 13). The new state plan removes this ambiguity and     emphasizes to both educators and students that high performance is not only applauded, but     expected.       The plan requires that districts offer gifted students a variety of curricular     options.  In working with students who need remedial services, it is a given that a     variety of educational techniques and options should be employed. The same need for     variety exists for all students. This requirement suggests that gifted students would not     only have the option of, for example, Advanced Placement at the high school level, but     also would be able to select from independent study courses or mentorships that enable     them to delve into an area of strength. Middle school students would not only have algebra     as an eighth grade mathematics option, but would participate in specially designed     mini-seminars or research projects that enable them to use their talents in specific     applications. Diversity of services assure that more advanced students will be served     appropriately and will meet the state goal of developing sophisticated products.       Inclusion of the ""recognized"" and ""exemplary"" levels of the     state plan emphasizes increasingly individualized services for highly gifted students.      At the ""acceptable"" level of the Texas state plan, districts are required to     develop general services that address advanced learners. As the plan moves to more     advanced degrees of implementation at the ""recognized"" and ""exemplary""     levels, more individualized services are expected. As an example, in the curriculum     section of the plan, all districts are expected to provide students with opportunities     ""to accelerate in areas of student strengths (3.3A)."" At the recognized level,     to meet criteria 3.3R, districts need to assure that ""Flexible pacing is employed,     allowing students to learn at the pace and level appropriate to their abilities and     skills."" At the exemplary level, 3.3E requires that ""Scheduling modifications     are implemented in order to meet the needs of individual students.""        Administrators and counselors must receive a one-time overview on gifted education.      Teacher training in the area of gifted education typically has been widely supported.     However, many times teachers' efforts to implement appropriate services are not supported     because of a lack of understanding on the part of administrators or counselors who must     balance the diverse needs of all students. The new state plan requires all administrators     and counselors with decision-making responsibilities for the program to receive a minimum     of six hours of professional development on the nature and needs of and program options     for gifted students. At the recognized level, local boards of trustees also would receive     minimal training on the state plan. At the exemplary level, administrators and counselors     would receive annual updates in the field.         Senate Bill 1 mandates that the state plan measure the performance of districts. The   District Effectiveness and Compliance (DEC) monitoring system established by the Texas   Education Agency determines whether or not districts are addressing the criteria required   for acceptable performance. Beginning in the spring of 1999, the Division of Advanced   Academic Services will pilot a process to recognize districts that exceed this level of   performance. Even with this system in place, no standard for student performance has been   adopted for students who participate in advanced level services. This is the next   challenge that faces Texas public schools.     The Status of Statewide Accountability of Performance of Gifted Students throughout   the Nation.  In 1998, the Texas Education Agency investigated current practices to   determine how states assess the performance of students participating in services for   gifted students. Appendix B contains an analysis of state assessment systems and explains   if and how they address advanced student performance. While some states recognize advanced   level performance, no state sets standards for performance of students served in gifted   programs. In part, this is due to the nature of the children themselves. Even when a group   of gifted students is identified, the group still consists of unique individuals whose   gifts and talents may be in different areas. For example, some students may be gifted in   the area of language arts, others in mathematics, some in leadership ability, others in   intellectual ability. This poses a dilemma when developing accountability of services.      Another factor in objective accountability of gifted student performance is that   standardized tests are simply not designed to measure this population. Even   norm-referenced assessments, the purpose of which is to describe the relative rank among   students, do not discriminate among gifted students. For example, a 40-item   norm-referenced exam may include 5 items that will challenge gifted students. This   five-item test will not differentiate the achievement of these students to any degree   useful for accountability. Criterion-referenced standardized exams could be developed for   this population. Development of such tests at the state level, however, could counteract   the goals of the state plan, which encourages more individualized services for gifted   students that would better meet student needs.     TEKS, TAAS, and Gifted Education.  Services to gifted students rest on the   foundation developed for the general school program. When Senate Bill 1 required that   Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) be developed for each content included in the   core and foundation areas of the curriculum, it provided the opportunity to increase   standards for all students. During the passage of the TEKS, which included input and   discussion from all segments of the educational community, each new draft provided a   higher level of sophistication than the previous one.     In most cases, the TEKS provide strong support for services to gifted students. This   foundation is intended to be enhanced as indicated by the curriculum standard included in   the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted Students.  That standard,   ""Curriculum and instruction meet the needs of gifted students by modifying the depth,   complexity, and pacing of the general school program,"" requires that the TEKS be   taught at a more sophisticated level and not necessarily rewritten when serving gifted   students. Before providing an example of this, it will be helpful to elaborate on what is   meant by pacing, depth, and complexity.     Depth, Complexity, and Pacing.  It is best to begin by stating that enhanced   depth and complexity are appropriate for all students at certain times. Most students   would be better served if the pacing of their classes were adjusted to specifically meet   their needs. However, in the case of advanced level students, these needs are more   consistent, and differentiated services are required for a greater proportion of the   student's school career. The services must be planned and educators need to develop a   continuum that reinforces already existing student strengths.     Modifications in pacing suggest that the curriculum is presented either more quickly or   more slowly than it might be in the general classroom. Many educators are familiar with   advanced students who frequently prove mastery of many of the basic skills of a particular   unit through a pre-test. In these cases, the students' progress might be accelerated. An   example of this might be those students who take algebra in the seventh or eighth grade   rather than taking the traditional mathematics courses taught at those grade levels.   However, it also is important to remember that gifted students sometimes have very deep   interests in certain areas and might need to spend more time exploring and developing   products in these areas. Adjusting the pacing of instruction was one recommendation   included in  Prisoners of Time  (1994), a report developed by the National Education   Commission on Time and Learning. The report notes that advanced students are often   ""forced to spend more time than they need on a curriculum developed for students of   moderate ability. Many become bored, unmotivated, and frustrated (p. 15)."" It further   recommends, ""(T)ime should be adjusted to meet the individual needs of learners,   rather than the administrative convenience of adultsâ€¦The flexible use of time can   permit more individualized instruction."" This is where enhancement of the TEKS   through enrichment may be meaningfully employed. The term ""enrichment"" has been   overused and misused very often. However, frequently students possess the basic skills in   subjects in which they are interested. They can ""buy"" time--collapse the basic   skills part of the subject--that enables them to delve deeper into other areas of the   subject that will use and develop those basic skills.     This is where depth and complexity come into play. As used by Dr. Sandra Kaplan, the   term ""depth"" refers to exploration within a discipline. How do teachers and   students dig deeper into the curriculum? There are a number of attributes that are   critical, both for building academic awareness of a discipline and for assuring that the   needs of motivated and advanced students are met. First, teachers can introduce students   to the  language of the discipline . What does it mean to hold   ""revisionist"" views of history? What does it mean when a literary work is a   ""revision?"" Many times, teachers and parents unwittingly talk down to students,   thinking that is the best way to be understood. However, students with deep interest in a   discipline want to know, and need to know, how professionals in that field talk to one   another. This can start as early as elementary school, with the vocabulary building from   one year to the next.     Another way of adding depth to a discipline is to emphasize its  details --those   things that make it unique from other subject areas. As an example, teachers can discuss   the parts of a fairy tale with young children, the common characteristics of myths from   various countries with elementary and middle school students, and the distinctions between   legal systems with high school government students. It also is important for students to   understand the  rules  that govern a specific discipline. This covers areas as   diverse as developing a thorough understanding of how the parts of government interact   with one another to the way in which scientific experiments are carried out. Sometimes   educators overlook the importance of ""just the facts,"" but these details will be   critical building blocks in more fully developing the other dimensions of depth.     Two of these dimensions,  patterns and trends , can be established only if the   student has a good grasp on the details and rules of the disciplines. By studying   patterns, students will become more aware of recurring events, elements, and ideas that   are repeated over time. Emphasizing trends enable students to identify the various factors   that affect and influence major concepts and ideas within a discipline. One reason why it   is important for students to understand the patterns and trends of a discipline is because   these dimensions allow students to speculate knowledgeably on the final three dimensions   of depth-- the big ideas, which define the principles, theories and generalizations of an   area of study, the  ethical issues and the unanswered questions  of a discipline.   These last components of depth are not to be viewed as topics to be presented late in a   student's school career. Students at all grade levels often are asked to comment on   ethical considerations in the stories they read or in historical and scientific events.   However, only by offering students the opportunity to consider the details, patterns, and   trends of a discipline can students be provided with the evidence they need to present   their viewpoints. And only by encouraging them to use the language of a discipline can   their viewpoints be offered in a knowledgeable manner.     Just as depth provides a firm foundation within a discipline, complexity focuses on   building understanding within and across disciplines. As students look at subjects  over   time, across disciplines, and from multiple perspectives , those subjects become richer   and more complex. When high school students study primary sources written at the time   World War I was fought as opposed to a television documentary created in the 1990's, they   see how interpretations of events have changed over time. When students study the Civil   War by reading speeches made in the Confederate Congress and the U.S. Congress, they begin   to understand the different perspectives in which the war was viewed. Students use the   knowledge they have gained to begin to draw more sophisticated conclusions about issues,   concepts, and events within disciplines.     While this overview provides only a brief picture of what is implied by depth,   complexity, and pacing, it is intended to offer some idea of what is expected of teachers   and students who participate in services designed as part of the program for gifted   students. The task of developing these services, which are increasingly individualized to   address student strengths and interests, is extremely demanding. However, the TEKS that   were adopted in 1997 provide a powerful base from which to begin the process.     As an example, one of the history TEKS for fourth grade students states that students   should ""understand the causes and effects of the Texas Revolution, the Republic of   Texas, and the annexation of Texas to the United States (113.4.3 TAC)."" The student   is to accomplish this, in part by analyzing ""the causes, major events, and effects of   the Texas Revolution, including battles of the Alamo and San Jacinto"" and to   ""describe the successes and problems of the Republic of Texas."" (113.4.3 [A] and   [B] TAC). Students with a deep interest in social studies might read some passages on the   American Revolution and then be asked to draw some conclusions about patterns they observe   on how such conflicts begin. The same might be done regarding the first years of the   United States as opposed to the Republic of Texas. Teachers might discuss with students   how historical research is done and have them read diaries published from the days of the   early Republic, so they begin to understand the rules of studying history by using primary   sources and observing how these resources are used in secondary sources. Another approach   might be to have students read letters from soldiers on both sides of the Texas Revolution   and to guide a discussion on how each side viewed the conflict. While these activities may   be too detailed and sophisticated for some students, highly advanced students will welcome   the opportunity to participate in such in-depth analysis. In all cases, the activities   build on the TEKS that are used for all students, but provide more rigor and challenge for   those students who are able to go further. Additional examples in the four foundation   areas of the curriculum are included in Appendix C.     Even though the enhanced activities are based on existing TEKS, some educators might   suggest that they take away time that might better be spent on study of TAAS objectives.   All of the activities included above re-enforce and support a more sophisticated approach   to instruction designed to ensure mastery of TAAS objectives. To adequately explore the   patterns and trends of newly created republics, students will need to understand how to   interpret graphs, maps, and timelines, explain how their various readings support   conclusions they have drawn, and make generalizations based on comparisons of various   texts. These objectives are required TAAS reading objectives for the fourth grade. Rather   than using elementary, transparent material for ""TAAS review,"" students instead   hone their skills on challenging material and assignments that are commensurate with their   abilities and reflect a sophisticated mastery of TAAS objectives.     The Future for Texas.  Texas is a national leader in the area of gifted   education. The new state plan, as indicated in Texas state law, emphasizes  district    accountability. It sets in place a structure that can, like the TEKS, be used as a   starting point for establishing exemplary services that require both high degrees of   effort and performance from gifted students. As districts establish their acceptable   levels of services, it is time for gifted students who participate in the services also to   meet a certain level of performance.     Just as the current Texas State plan for gifted students is unique in its approach   because it recognizes districts that exceed state requirements, an innovative approach is   needed to assure that gifted students are offered services at a level commensurate with   their abilities. The ""test"" of this must be in the effort and skill exhibited in   the products developed by students who participate in the services. Because of the   inadequacy of test data to address the performance of gifted students, because of the   individualized nature of gifted students' talents and abilities, because the state of   Texas is committed to supporting services to gifted students by providing a mandate and   funding, it is necessary to establish both standards and methods of assessing products and   performances.      Report after report emphasizes that high school students are doing less and less to   obtain both good grades in high school and acceptance into colleges of their choice. In  Hard   Work and High Expectations: Motivating Students to Learn  (1990), Tommy Tomlinson   notes, ""By any calculation, American students do not take much time from their day to   study. But then, as it turns out, so long as they graduate, they have little reason to do   so. Traditional sources of motivation-college admission, workplace requirements, and   parental pressure-have all accommodated to the situation; indeed, students have learned   that, beyond the diploma, few doors are opened or closed to them by their record of high   school achievement or their academic work ethic (4)."" The report further notes that   more and more college professors, even at elite institutions, complain about the level of   preparedness of incoming college freshmen.     There has been little change in these concerns in the eight years since the report was   published. In 1998, 47% of Texas students who took the SAT-I reported having an   ""A"" average, a percentage significantly higher than the national average of 38%.   Students believe they are doing well and therefore may be avoiding testing themselves   against other students participating in high level learning opportunities. According to   the College Board, less than half of the Texas students who take an Advanced Placement   class take the examination that would assess them on their learning of the material. Many   Texas students, including those who are high achieving and college bound, are not being   assessed by high criteria commensurate with their abilities. Students have become adept at   determining what is required and doing just enough to get by. Students in services that   are part of the gifted program should be working with more complex content and   participating in more challenging opportunities. In turn, this premise suggests that the   students will be putting forth more effort and producing more sophisticated products that   reflect the advanced level instruction they have received. Participation in a program for   gifted students is not a reward or an entitlement-it comes with the expectation that   increased levels of rigor will be followed by increased levels of performance.     Campus and district performance improved when the expectations for accountability were   clearly established. If more sophisticated instruction is desired in classrooms, and if   more sophisticated products are desired of students who are capable of producing them, the   same formula of clear expectations tied to accountability will need to be developed. The   following recommendations are designed to support district efforts by providing standards   for student products/performances and to provide incentives for districts whose students   attain those standards.     Recommendation 1:   Legislation will be adopted requiring that the Texas   Education Agency develop standards of performance in language arts, mathematics, science,   and social studies for products developed by students participating in programs for the   gifted in grades four, eight, and eleven. These standards will be used by all Texas   districts to determine the effectiveness of their services to gifted students and will   form the basis of program modification.     Student performance indicators such as TAAS currently in place in Texas assess skills   for all students. TAAS does not include advanced levels that would be appropriate for   gifted students. At the secondary level, indicators such as performance on Advanced   Placement and International Baccalaureate examinations could be used for assessment;   however, all school districts do not offer these courses and there is debate as to whether   or not they are effective measures of gifted/talented student performance. There are no   equivalent measures to be used at the elementary or middle school levels.     Although the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted/Talented Students    provides school-based indicators that lead to recognized and exemplary levels of school   performance, currently, there are no specific student performance indicators. Student   performance is addressed in increasing increments moving from acceptable to recognized and   on to exemplary. To attain recognized designation, districts must have gifted students at   all grade levels involved in experiences that result in the development of sophisticated   products and/or performances. Student progress/performance in programs for the gifted must   be assessed periodically and information communicated to parents. To achieve an exemplary   rating, districts must assess student performance by standards developed by experts. This   recommendation would enable the agency to collaborate with experts and provide benchmarks   for districts assessing the level of sophistication of student products.     The recommendation would provide more specificity related to expectations of student   performance and give districts guidance on modifying the depth, complexity, and pacing of   curriculum and instruction. Provided clear, unambiguous targets, students would recognize   the need for hard work and effort in order to be successful in the challenging services   that were offered.     Recommendation 2:   Legislation will be adopted requiring that district   personnel present annual reports to local boards of trustees on the level of attainment of   students participating in gifted programs.  This recommendation builds on the previous   one and would require that a report be provided by district personnel annually to the   local board of trustees on the achievement of gifted students according to standards   established by the agency. Exemplary designation in the state plan requires that ongoing   formative and summative evaluation strategies be used for substantive program improvement   and reviewed by the school board. This recommendation would require formal reports that   would be made public at board meetings and would enable the community and parents to   determine the progress that was being made to address the state standards for student   performance.     Recommendation 3:   Legislation will be adopted amending TEC 42.156 (f) to   increase the $500,000 set-aside to be used to train personnel and provide program services   to up to $1,000,000 so that the Texas Education Agency can provide training and develop a   system to financially reward districts that attain recognized or exemplary levels of   performance in services to gifted students.     Section 42.156 of the TEC states that legislative set-aside money be used to provide   services that are effective and consistent with the state plan. Districts must put local   monies into services in order to attain recognized and exemplary designation. The   increased funding would be used to develop both student standards and a system of   financial remuneration, and to provide the actual financial awards.

GX068-19-7278670	A r c h i v e dÂ Â I n f o r m a t i o n        ATTENTION:  EDUCATION EDITOR                         June 1, 1994                A review of current programs and projects at the            U.S. Department of Education.  Use upon receipt.        CONTACT:  Melinda Kitchell  (202) 401-1008    ITEM:  MAGNET SCHOOLS SWELL IN NUMBER, DEMAND STILL UNMET     The number of magnet schools in America has more than doubled    since the early 1980s as they have become a significant part of    the nation's efforts to desegregate its schools, according to a    report issued today by the U.S. Department of Education.        Educational Innovation in Multiracial Contexts:  The Growth of    Magnet Schools in American Education notes that in 1991-92, 2,400    individual magnet schools and 3,200 magnet programs were open in    about 230 public school districts.  The number of students    enrolled in magnet programs totaled 1.2 million, up three-fold    since 1981-82.       First launched by school districts in the late 1970s, magnet    schools are used to help desegregate schools while also improving    the quality of education by offering a distinctive curriculum or    instructional approach to attract students from outside the    neighborhood.  They differ from other specialty schools and    school choice programs in that desegregation is an explicit    objective.  Most magnet school programs are associated with    formal desegregation plans, and more than a quarter of districts    operating under desegregation plans include magnets as part of    their plan.  More than half of magnet programs are found in large    urban districts.     Among the report's highlights:  Outreach Efforts           Magnet districts encourage enrollment through outreach              efforts and by providing transportation services.               Districts publicize magnet school offerings through              brochures and tours of school programs.  The study              found that districts with magnet schools put more              effort into outreach than do districts with other              school choice programs, and districts with magnet              programs are also more apt to provide transportation to              students who change schools (three-quarters of magnet              districts provide transportation).  More than 60              percent of magnet districts cannot accommodate all              students who wish to enroll, and about half of all              magnet programs maintain waiting lists.  Integration Efforts           Magnets appear to be effective in attracting opposite              race students to magnet schools.  One purpose of              magnets is to provide incentives for families to remain              in public schools and to send their children to              integrated schools.  In minority-dominant districts,              white students comprise 32 percent of magnet students,              versus 20 percent of overall district enrollment.  In              white-dominant districts, minority students comprise 46              percent of magnet students versus 31 percent of              district enrollment.  Of the students enrolled in              magnet programs, about three-quarters transferred              outside their neighborhood attendance zone.        Special Population Efforts           Low-income students, those with limited English              proficiency, and those in special education are              somewhat under-represented in magnet programs relative              to their proportions in the district.  Their under-              representation is more prevalent in high-minority and              high-poverty districts, where efforts to reduce              minority isolation may increase the enrollment of              higher-income students.      Federal Efforts                Between 1985 and 1993, the federal Magnet School              Assistance Program provided more than $739 million to              117 school districts to support growth of new magnet              programs and expansion of existing programs.  More than              three-quarters of districts use their funds to start              new magnet school programs or to add schools to their              existing magnet programs.           The report was prepared under contract for the department by the    American Institutes for Research in Palo Alto, Calif.  Much of    the data was collected through surveys and telephone interviews    of a nationally representative sample of 600 school districts.

GX252-26-12721784	"Texas School Performance Review        Austin Independent School District   April 2000            Chapter 2        EDUCATIONAL SERVICE DELIVERY          This chapter discusses the Austin Independent School District's (AISD's) educational service delivery system and student performance measures in nine sections:        A. Student Performance and Education Service Delivery       B. Dropout Prevention, Recovery and Leaver Codes       C. Instructional Resources       D. Bilingual Education       E. Advanced Academic Services       F. Special Education Programs       G. School to Career Programs       H. Health Services       I. Compensatory Support Programs            E.  ADVANCED ACADEMIC SERVICES    The Office of Advanced Academic Services for AISD is responsible for coordinating several programs, including the gifted and talented programs, honors programs, the Duke Talent Search Program, three magnet school programs, advanced placement studies, the International Baccalaureate program, Future Problem Solving and the summer institute.   FINDING    AISD has three magnet programs, one in a junior high school and two in high schools. The junior high school magnet program, housed at Kealing Junior High School, offers both a science and liberal arts magnet curricula. The Science Academy, housed at LBJ High School, offers science and math curricula. The third program, housed at Johnston High School, offers a liberal arts magnet curriculum. These three schools combined accept approximately 1000 students every school year. Currently, the district is planning to open a second junior high magnet program at Fulmore Middle School in the 2000-01 school year.   Magnet schools provide a challenging and innovative educational environment for qualified middle and high school students. The main goal is academic acceleration and excellence, with an emphasis on independent study and learning. These programs prepare students for higher-level educational opportunities. AISD students may apply to these programs by completing an application form that considers grades, ITBS scores, teacher evaluation and a personal essay. Usually, students must score at or above the 70th percentile on an achievement test and have grades of 80 or above.   Teachers and parents interviewed said that magnet programs are places where teachers can observe exemplary practices, and new, successful approaches to instructional delivery. Among the various programs and activities, one finds a rich variety of course offerings and an active involvement with area colleges, universities and local businesses. This involvement offers internship programs for both AISD and university students and brings expert speakers and tutors from various educational fields.   Students from every campus are encouraged to apply. Program directors make efforts to increase participation from schools with high minority student enrollment. Kealing Junior High School recruits from every sixth grade in the district. The school has a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin and with Ortega, Zavala, TA Brown, Walnut Creek, Barrington and Pecan Springs Elementary Schools to participate in a Young Scientists program that identifies and prepares students in the district's predominately minority schools for Kealing Magnet Program. In one elementary, a science teacher from Kealing works one period every other day with the grade 6 teachers.   At LBJ High School, the class of 1999 (120 students) included: 14 National Merit Scholars, 17 National Merit Semifinalists, 17 National Merit Commended Scholars, 2 National Achievement Scholarships for Outstanding Negro Students and 5 National Hispanic Scholarships. The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was administered to 120 students. The average verbal score was 613, and the average mathematics score was 636. At Kealing Junior High, approximately 60 students received state recognition in the Duke Talent Search.   COMMENDATION   Through the three magnet schools, AISD has done an outstanding job providing opportunities for students to explore in depth, advanced, challenging curricula in science, mathematics, technology and liberal arts.   FINDING    AISD's magnet program is challenging and exemplary, and many parents have urged the district to expand magnet programs to include other curricula. Seventy-two percent of community members responding to a survey said AISD should expand its magnet school offerings to include additional programs like engineering and fine arts. Community members also said that they would like the district's high school magnet programs to have their own campus.   AISD magnet programs function as a ""school within a school,"" with one segment of the student body enrolled in the magnet program. Interviews with program directors, teachers, principals and community members demonstrate an uncertainty over whether the original intended effect of housing magnet programs in campuses that educate high percentages of economically disadvantaged students helps the host school, or if they create an antagonistic, resentful relationship between magnet and non-magnet student and teacher groups.   AISD's first magnet program, the Science Academy at LBJ High School, was established in 1985 with magnet directors reporting directly to the assistant superintendent for Secondary Education. The original intent was to create a program that would have sufficient autonomy to allow program directors to develop innovative instructional programs. When the Liberal Arts program was established in Johnston High School in 1987, magnet directors began reporting to the school principal. Magnet program directors still report directly to the school principal, although area superintendents also routinely call upon them. Directors said that many times they are reporting to two people, and that they are not evaluated regularly, or by the same person from year to year.   In Kealing Junior High School, magnet students make up two-thirds of the school. In this case, the magnet director is responsible for two-thirds of the school, yet must report to the school principal. Several issues that should be left up to the magnet director's discretion, like budget decisions, teacher evaluations and when to hire teachers, must be approved by the school principal. Magnet directors and principals said their relationship is strained, and at times has led to resentment and distrust. Magnet directors are often called on to help the school principal perform duties that are completely unrelated to their jobs as magnet program directors.   Reagan High School's facilities have been significantly underused for years and operate at only 59 percent capacity. Underused facilities are costly, wasteful, and a drain on a district's resources. Reagan High School, located near the intersection of Interstate 35 and US Highway 290 in Austin's preferred growth corridor, is centrally located and accessible from surrounding Central Texas communities. The facility has both large permanent classroom capacity and ample parking.   Kealing Middle School, with a capacity of 1,176 students, has a 1999-2000 enrollment of 958, with approximately 600 magnet students. The district's magnet school at Kealing serves only 7th and 8th grade students; prospective magnet students completing elementary school must attend 6th grade at another campus before enrolling at Kealing. The Kealing magnet director and parents of magnet students agree that the Kealing magnet program needs to be open to 6th graders. Magnet directors and community members also said that middle school magnet offerings should be expanded and that magnet schools need their own campuses.   Recommendation 35:   Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.      The Science Academy at LBJ High School and the Liberal Arts Academy at Johnston High School should be relocated to the Reagan campus. Reagan High School would become a Regional Magnet Campus, open to students from AISD and other Central Texas school districts.   The Regional Magnet Campus should offer advanced programs in science and liberal arts, develop new magnet programs such as a fine arts academy, and establish a technology academy for students who wish to develop the skills that will make them employable in the Austin economy. The district should bring together representatives from Austin's high tech, business, and higher education communities to provide resources toward making the Reagan Regional Magnet Campus the educational crown jewel of Central Texas.   The magnet schools at LBJ and Johnston high schools currently serve 1,100 students (774 in the Science Academy and 326 in the Liberal Arts Academy). The capacity of Reagan High School means that it initially could accommodate at least 1,500 magnet students while also housing AISD central administrative staff. (TSPR recommends that AISD relocate its central office to the Reagan High School Facility. See Chapter 1, District Organization and Management.)   Creating an AISD Middle School Magnet Campus will enable the district to better meet the needs of its qualified middle school magnet students.  Kealing Middle School should be a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight with expanded magnet program offerings.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   Superintendent designates an area superintendent to whom magnet directors will report.        June 2000       2. The superintendent directs the deputy superintendents to develop a plan for converting Reagan High School into a Regional Magnet Campus, housing a Science Academy, a Liberal Arts Academy and a Technology Academy and for converting Kealing Middle School into the district's Middle School Magnet Campus.        July 2000       3. The superintendent and the executive cabinet redraw attendance zones so that students who would currently track to Reagan High School and Kealing Middle School will track to other high schools and middle schools.        March 2001       4. The superintendent presents the magnet campus plan and redrawn attendance zones to the board for approval.        August 2001       5. The board approves the plan.        September 2001 and Ongoing          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing staff and facilities. Magnet staff will follow students to the new Reagan Magnet at an estimated cost of $300,000 relocation and renovation expenses for the Science Academy and $200,000 for the Liberal Arts Academy. Transportation costs should not change significantly as students will need to be transported to two instead of three district magnet campuses.        Recommendation      2000-01      2001-02      2002-03      2003-04      2004-05       Locate a new Regional Magnet Campus at the Reagan High School facility and make Kealing Middle School a magnet-only campus for grades six through eight.      $0      $0     ($500,000)      $0      $0          FINDING    AISD does not regularly report student information separately, such as TAAS and ITBS scores or the percentage of students taking the SAT, for students enrolled in magnet programs and for students enrolled in the regular program on the same campus. If this information is available at the district office, it is not fully disseminated to parents or the community at large.   In interviews and focus groups, teachers, principals, parents and community members said that without this information, the real performance of non-magnet students is masked. TEA does not require districts to provide magnet vs. non-magnet program information, and accountability ratings do not reflect magnet program participation. Teachers, principals and parents said that schools that host magnet programs would be seriously at-risk of receiving a low-performance accountability rating if the magnet programs were not housed at these schools.   Exhibit 2-30  shows the percentage of students attending magnet schools and the percentage of students not attending magnet schools who passed the TAAS in 1996-97 and 1998-99. The data show that there is a large performance gap between students at magnet schools and students at non-magnet schools. For non-magnet students, less than 50 percent passed the mathematics test, except for Kealing Junior High School in 1998-99.  Exhibits 2-31, 2-32  and  2-33  present TAAS, math, reading and writing scores for 1998-99.

The Austin Magnet Committee Report (December 1998), said that there are concerns that the current magnet model (school-within-a-school) has a ""negative impact on the delivery of effective curricula to the non-magnet students in the host schools.""   The committee report states, ""The current magnet model serves to mask the academic difficulties of non-magnet students."" Using accountability standards for the 1998-99 school year, TAAS scores for these schools reinforce these concerns. The committee believes that disclosing the performance of non-magnet students would bring attention and possible state and federal financial resources to help improve the performance of non-magnet students at these campuses.   Recommendation 36:   Evaluate the educational and economic impact of magnet programs on host campuses.    Use comparative magnet/non-magnet test scores, course selection and other indicators to identify and focus services on students in host schools who are not succeeding academically.   To address all students' needs, school and district staff must have information that provides information on the performance of all students in a school. Teachers, campus administrators, parents and community members should have access to this information to make appropriate instructional decisions.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to temporarily postpone opening a third magnet campus at Fulmore Middle School until findings and recommendations from an evaluation can be assessed.        May 2000       2. Magnet directors, campus principals and district data management staff coordinate efforts and provide comparative data for schools that host magnet programs. Data will include for each school: ITBS scores, TAAS scores, SAT participation and scores, grade point averages and dropout and attendance rates.        June 2000  Ongoing       3. The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to identify federal and state funds that current magnet schools would receive if magnet programs were housed elsewhere.        June 2000       4. The director of the Department of Transportation determines costs of providing transportation for students to one versus two campuses.        June 2000       5. The assistant director of the Office of Program Evaluation develops and implements strategies to assess the benefit of hosting magnet programs on campuses with specific socio-economic characteristics.        June - November 2000       6. Campus principals make data available to all parents in the annual school performance report.        August 2000       7. Principals and teachers use data to address specific student performance issues and develop strategies to include in campus improvement plans.        August 2000       8. Staff in the Office of Program Evaluation identify the positive and negative impact of AISD'S program placement policy.        December 2000       9. The superintendent directs the appropriate departments to implement recommendations on optimal placement for magnet programs.        February 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    There is no clear evidence that the district's approach for teaching gifted and talented children is effective. Texas state law requires all school districts to identify and provide services for gifted and talented students. In 1990, the State Board of Education (SBOE) adopted the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students.  This plan is a guide on how to meet the law's requirements. In 1996, the State Board of Education (SBOE) updated the plan to incorporate Texas Education Code Section 29.123 requirements. The updated plan forms the basis of program accountability for state-mandated services for gifted and talented students.   AISD's Office of Advanced Academic Services defines gifted and talented students as students who are advanced intellectually and academically. Their gifts may be apparent in one or more subjects, like English, math, science and social studies, or in their ability to learn rapidly.   In many cases, a regular or honors curriculum cannot meet the needs of gifted and talented students. According to the coordinator of Advanced Academic Services, the district does not meet the program standards recommended in the State Plan. Compliance varies from school to school. Some principals could describe the process of gifted and talented student identification and list the services provided for these students. Others, however, said there was no effort made to provide services for these students. Several principals, teachers and central administration staff said AISD's gifted and talented educational program was weak and in many instances non-existent.   Bilingual teachers and district administrators said there are no specific efforts to identify gifted bilingual education students. Campus and district staff said that even though it is recommended in the State Plan, there is no identification process for science and social studies; gifted students in those core subjects are not identified. Interviews with campus teachers involved in gifted education and with members of the Austin Association of Gifted and Talented Education indicated that, while the Office of Advanced Academic Services' responsibilities include coordinating several programs for high achieving students, the office does not have adequate resources to fulfill its responsibilities. Overall, AISD is not complying with the state plan for gifted and talented students.   State law requires teachers of gifted and talented students to receive 30 hours of instruction in teaching gifted and talented students.  The format in which gifted and talented services are delivered to students is a campus decision. All teachers in the district are encouraged to receive training. Training all teachers, with the current district turnover rate, however, is a difficult task. Even if a teacher is trained, that teacher may or may not be teaching gifted children.  Teachers told TSPR that most do not have enough time to provide appropriate services to gifted students. Although training may improve a teacher's instructional methods, it does not ensure that properly trained teachers will be teaching gifted students.   Program staff, parents and community association members noted that AISD does not have a district-level accountability system in place for assessing the quality of the gifted and talented program. Staff and parents said that the district is now implementing its own gifted and talented plan, and that this plan is still in draft form. The agenda published for the Office of Program Evaluation for the 1999-2000 school year, however, does not include any plans for evaluating gifted and talented education in this district. The assistant director of the Department of Accountability said that the gifted and talented educational program has not been evaluated in at least five years.   Recommendation 37:   Implement the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students .   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Office of Program Evaluation and the Office of Academic Studies evaluate the effectiveness of the district's gifted and talented education program.        August 2000 -February 2001       2. The Office of Advanced Academic Services determines if every campus in the district is implementing the recommendations in the  Texas State Plan for the Education of Gifted and Talented Students .      January 2001       3. The Office of Advanced Academic Services develops measures to ensure that every campus follows the State Plan.        March 2001- August 2001       4. The Office of Advanced Academic Services uses the State Plan to develop an accountability system for gifted and talented programs in AISD.         March 2001 -December 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    Several district and campus-level staff, in addition to members of the Austin Area Association of Gifted and Talented Education said how the district manages its information on its gifted and talented education program does not help teachers and principals to identify gifted and talented students on their own campuses. Most high school teachers do not know who their gifted students are. One principal, for instance, said, ""We don't know if anything is accurate...Sally may be identified as gifted and talented on three different campuses."" Another high school principal said, ""I cannot obtain a list of students on my campus that are gifted and talented; if it is available, it is extremely difficult to obtain.""   The assistant director of the Office of Research and Evaluation said that AISD does not have a code in the student master file that allows administrative staff to track gifted students. Although the data may be available, it is in different files and not easily accessible. The current information system does not provide administrators with information to improve services for gifted students, nor does it help in the decision-making process.

As shown in  Exhibit 2-34 , compared to the peer districts, AISD had the second highest number of students identified as gifted, yet the number and percentage of teachers assigned to gifted programs was the lowest. This number, however, does not accurately represent the number of teachers teaching gifted students in AISD.   The interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report is incorrect. She said that for the 1999-2000 school year, the correct number of certified gifted and talented teachers is 1,642. This number is significantly higher than the number of teachers reported in the AEIS reports for the peer districts. Both the interim coordinator for Advanced Academic Services, and an administrative assistant in TEA's Office of Advanced Academic Services said that the number of teachers reported in the AEIS report could vary considerably depending on the type of instructional delivery.   In AISD, gifted instruction is provided through the regular classroom, and because all teachers are encouraged to become certified, it is expected that the number of certified gifted teachers would be high. This number, however, does not provide any information on how much time regular classroom gifted and talented certified teachers allocate to gifted and talented instruction.   Recommendation 38:   Establish a system to accurately identify, track and report the number of gifted students and certified gifted and talented teachers involved in teaching gifted students.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Office of Academic Studies coordinates with the district data management system staff to add a field to the student database so gifted students are identified and the information is accessible to approved campus staff.        August 2000 -February 2001       2. Review number and percentage of teachers allocated to gifted and talented education reported to TEA and report a number that accurately reflects the number of teachers in gifted and talented education.        August 2000 -February 2001          FISCAL IMPACT    This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING      In AISD, there is no evidence how gifted and talented funds are used to meet the needs of gifted students. The coordinator of Advanced Academic Services and members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Education Association said that is impossible to track expenses for gifted education, in part, because the budget process does not include line-item descriptions of allocations for the gifted. Because of this problem, it is not known if the expenditures for gifted and talented education indicated in the AEIS reports are correct.

Exhibit 2-35  shows AISD's expenditures for gifted and talented education. For the 1998-99 school year, AISD ranked second to last among its peer districts on spending for gifted and talented education. Peer districts with similar numbers of identified gifted and talented students (more than 5,000) spent significantly more on gifted education. Budget allocations for gifted and talented education comprised 0.2 percent of the budgeted expenditures, also amongst the lowest compared to the peer districts. Compared to the peer districts, AISD ranked lowest in the per student expenditures for gifted education.   According to TEA's Division of Advanced Academic Services, AISD received approximately $1Â million in state Gifted and Talented funds for the 1998-99; and for 1999-2000, according to TEA's Division of State Funding, the district received $1,161,118. According to the AEIS report, AISD budgeted less than half of the funds that it received for gifted and talented education.   The district has known about this reporting problem since at least 1996. To remedy this problem, the district's Comprehensive Plan (preliminary recommendations, April 19, 1996) states that ""Beginning in 1996-97 and annually thereafter, the AISD administration will produce an annual report of the distribution of all funds targeted for gifted and talented education which clearly identifies how these funds were allocated for expenditure."" The annual report has not been produced. Members of the Austin Area Gifted and Talented Association have requested copies of this report, but the district has not provided the association with the report.   Recommendation 39:   Annually report the distribution of funds allocated to gifted and talented education.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Budget Director and staff in the Office of Advanced Academic Services produce an annual report showing how all funds targeted for gifted and talented education were actually spent.        May 2001          FISCAL IMPACT      This recommendation can be implemented with existing resources.   FINDING    AISD requires teachers to modify the regular curriculum to meet the individual needs of each gifted student. The coordinator for Advanced Academic Services said that AISD does not have a grade-level, appropriate curriculum for gifted and talented education. Several parents expressed concern over the quality of the instruction that was considered gifted and talented. Likewise, several teachers expressed concern about their ability to meet their students' needs. Members of the PTA Council said there should be a defined gifted and talented program curriculum for different subjects and for each grade. They stressed this curriculum or lack thereof should not depend on the school or the teacher.   Recommendation 40:   Develop gifted and talented curriculum guides by grade level and content.      This will require the district to extend the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers during the summer months for four years to complete this task.   IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES AND TIMELINE       1.   The Department of Human Resources extends the contracts of four gifted and talented certified teachers, two for the elementary grades and two for secondary level.        May 2000 -  May 2002       2. The Office of Advanced Academic Services works with these teachers to develop gifted and talented curriculum guides for every grade level and every content area.        June 2000-August 2002         3. The Office of Advanced Academic Services distributes curriculum guides.        August 2000- August 2002          4.

GX070-07-8918915	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e dÂ Â I n f o r m a t i o n     Secondary Schools   Achieving a World-Class Standard  in a Culturally Diverse Community   Gompers Secondary School Center for  Science,  Mathematics, and Computer Technology Magnet   San Diego City Schools Â· San Diego, California   OVERVIEW    When Gompers Secondary School Center for Science, Mathematics, and Computer Technology Magnet began its schoolwide program in 1995, it unified its seventh- through twelfth-grade program components into a single plan with the same ambitious vision for all students. ""Our vision is to educate all of our students with a challenging world-class curriculum in a safe, culturally diverse setting,"" stated Gompers Principal Marie Thornton. ""To do this, we have created a program that meets every student's needs.""  Gompers' academic program, a citywide magnet offering science, mathematics, and computer technology, is consistent with the demanding academic standards and other reforms mandated by the San Diego City Schools. Students participate in individually tailored academic programs, which are coordinated by one of five counselors. The same standardsâ€”with the appropriate modificationsâ€”apply for students with disabilities and for students who speak limited English. Honors courses and advanced placement classes are available to all students who meet the academic requirements.  The school's budget combines general state and local funds with resources from four ESEA programsâ€”Title I  Eisenhower Professional Development, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, and Innovative Education Program Strategiesâ€”as well as from the Perkins Program, the National Science Foundation's Urban Systemic Initiative, a grant from the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation, Gifted and Talented Education (GATE), and Healthy Start.        Gompers serves a multicultural, districtwide population of students, half of whom are from homes with a primary language other than English.             Grade Levels  7-12       Number of Students  (1997-98)  1,586         Schoolwide Since  1992-93       Racial/Ethnic Composition     36% Â  Hispanic   35% Â  African American   15% Â  Indo-Chinese   10% Â  White   3%  Â  Other           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING  Gompers serves students from 19 racial and ethnic groups, among them Hispanic, African American, Laotian, white, Somali, Japanese, and Chinese. Communitywide commitment transformed Gompers from a fragmented, low-achieving school to a cohesive schoolwide family of high- achievers, integrating its magnet program with a schoolwide philosophy.   Shared decisionmaking at Gompers occurs through several oversight structures. Department chairs and members of the classified staff head key committees, such as the Bilingual Advisory Committee and School Site Council. Proposals for new programs or activities move through committees, where membersâ€”including parentsâ€”debate ideas and flesh out concepts before sending the proposals to the faculty or Governance Team. The 10-member Governance Team finalizes committee decisions, which are then sent to either the principal's Administrative Council, three in-school decision-making bodies, or parents for approval. According to Dr. Thornton, ""Most of the time we use consensus, but when we're not quite sure if we have consensus we take a voteâ€”sometimes one that includes a secret ballot.""      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS    To graduate from high school, students complete 44 credits, meet a citizenship standard, participate in community service, achieve a minimum 2.0 grade point average, and complete satisfactorily a comprehensive senior portfolio and exhibitions scored by school and community evaluators.   Gompers requires students to meet standards that exceed those of the district. It insists that students complete the district's 44-credit course requirements and its good citizenship standard, but then adds that students must earn a minimum 2.0 grade point average. Students must have a 2.5 grade point average and satisfactory citizenship to represent the school in off-campus activities. There is ""zero tolerance"" of truancies and uncleared absences. In addition to reviewing test scores, counselors regularly monitor each student's progress in content areas. Staff use in-class assessments and other performance data to continually align curricula with expected student performance results. The annual School Accountability Report Card informs Gompers staff and parents about students' progress on district and school goals.   Each year, the district and the school administer several measures of performance. The abbreviated Stanford Achievement Test (SAT) documents academic progress in basic reading, mathematics, language, and  spelling. Students in Spanish bilingual classes take the  Aprenda , Stanford's Spanish-language achievement test that parallels the SAT. The district also reports twelfth-grade students' results on the Scholastic Assessment Test. Other performance indicators include retention, dropout, and suspension rates, and the percent of students who meet university entrance requirements.     In 1997, 96% of graduating seniors pursued postsecondary educational opportunities; 51% of these  students enrolled in four-year colleges.   Gompers' 1996 and 1997 assessment results show steady progress in all subject areas and across all grades. Seventh-graders score well below nationally standardized norms when they enter Gompers; but, by the time they reach high school, more than half of its students will achieve at the national mean in reading, language arts, and mathematics. In 1996, 95 percent of graduating seniors pursued postsecondary education, with 55 percent enrolling in four-year colleges and 40 percent enrolling in two-year colleges. In 1997, those statistics were 51 percent and 45, respectively, with 96 percent of seniors pursuing postsecondary education. Graduates attend the most selective colleges, universities, and military academies in the nation, including Cornell, Stanford, Syracuse, Spelman, University of Chicago, and Fisk. In 1997, Gompers selected eight top students as valedictorians, and that year's graduating class received more than $400,000 in scholarships and grants.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES    From 8:20am to 8:40am the campus is quiet; everyone is reading.   Because many students who enter Gompers' seventh grade read at low levels, the staff initiated a schoolwide focus on literacy. According to Dr. Thornton, one of Gompers' most effective strategies for closing the reading achievement gap has been daily, sustained silent reading, which occurs from 8:20 am to 8:40 am. ""The campus is quiet. Everyone is reading. By encouraging students to read materials of interest and at their independent reading level, they get to the point where they enjoy reading. Once students enjoy it, success builds upon success,"" she said.   Gompers instituted an array of strategies to close the academic achievement gap, bolster students' confidence, and prepare them for a rigorous high school program. Entering seventh-graders begin their academic career at Gompers at a six-week camp. There they take mini-courses in English, science, mathematics, social studies, and computer applications, and learn about the school's expectations for homework, note taking, and keeping up with daily assignments. Enrollment is voluntary, but almost half the entering class attend the minicourses.     Seventh- and eighth-grade students receive intensive preparation for a demanding high school curriculum.    Students with weak literacy or numeracy skills enroll in double sessions of English or mathematics during their middle school years. These classes are taught by teachers specially trained to teach students the prerequisite skills they need to excel in the seventh- and eighth-grade English and mathematics programs. A highly skilled seventh-grade academic team prepares students for the school's high standards through a curriculum that integrates science, computers, social studies, mathematics, and English. Teachers use problem solving, critical thinking, and extended assignments and exhibitions to advance students' learning. Each classroom has access to the World Wide Web for research. Gompers is one of seven schools nationally that participates in NASA's KidSat. This program connects Gompers seventh-graders through an Internet hookup to the Student Mission Center, where they can meet astronauts and conduct online experiments with them.     There is ""zero tolerance"" for truancy or uncleared absences.   Nine special education teachers, three of whom are resource specialists, monitor the progress of students with disabilities as specified in their IEPs. These specialists collaborate with general education teachers. Entering students who do not speak English proficiently may take bilingual academic classes to keep up with content requirements while also developing the English-language skills needed to succeed in higher grades.     All Gompers' high school students take four years of English, four years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, three years of social sciences, and four years of laboratory science.    Gompers high school students must take four years of English, four years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, three years of social sciences, and four years of laboratory science. Up-to-date equipment and resourcesâ€”including a ""sun station"" that powers an eight-inch telescope in the school's outdoor lab, a state-of-the-art computer network with 64 terminals, and a laser/holography apparatusâ€”support advanced science, mathematics, and computer courses. Technology courses introduce students to robotics, electronics, computer graphics, desktop publishing, and computer-aided drafting and architecture; these courses also enhance school-to-work transitions. Students can combine computer applications courses with their business interests, and learn the language of computer data structures in courses on digital electronics. ""The thing I try to do is have the students with the greatest needs take as many challenging classes as they can,"" Dr. Thornton explained. Advanced mathematics, science, and social studies courses taught by faculty from nearby universities develop students' skills in research, experimentation, and use of technical equipment. The high school offers seven foreign languages. Four of the languages are introduced in an exploratory seventh-grade language course that teaches six weeks each of French, German, Japanese, and Russian language art and culture to help students decide which language they would like to continue studying in high school.     In-school programs and clubs reinforce the expectations to achieve and they provide students with a safety net for ensuring success.   A motivational program, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), lays the groundwork for students to meet the school's high expectations. An honor roll system recognizes students at all ranges of the academic continuum. The highest recognition, the Principal's Honor Roll, requires a minimum 4.0 grade point average; for students who achieve between the 2.0 and 2.9 grade point levels, the ""It's O.K. To Be Smart"" Honor Roll confers status if students have shown a willingness to challenge themselves. Satisfactory citizenship is a prerequisite for all honor roll students.     Every senior takes either the ACT or the SAT in preparation for postsecondary education.   Programs and clubs reinforce the school's expectations for achievement and provide a safety net for students. A mathematics, engineering, and science achievement programâ€”funded by the National Science Foundation, the state of California, and private donationsâ€”encourages nonwhite students to study for careers in science and mathematics. The faculty collaborates with mathematics and science scholars at San Diego State University to raise students' awareness of study options in the hard sciences and to create opportunities for high school students to participate in mathematics, science, and computer activities, experiments, and performance demonstrations. Other faculty offer as many as 35 clubs and programs that appeal to students' interests, including academics, athletics, service, journalism, theater, student government, and technology. High school students interested in school-to-work opportunities may enroll in computer application and business courses that help prepare them for the world of work.      PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY    All of Gompers' professional staff are credentialed in their primary teaching fields; beginning teachers receive help from experienced mentors; parents participate with the faculty in staff development exercises.    Professional development is continuous for all faculty, administrative staff, and others affiliated with the school. Teachers present on-site workshops for their colleagues and regularly share new strategies, techniques, and effective problem-based instruction with professionals from other schools. Beginning teachers in the New Teacher Induction Program visit classrooms to observe other teachers and attend professional growth classes. Each month, mentor teachers observe new teachers and advise them on strengthening their use of curricula, instructional methods, and classroom management techniques. All of Gompers' professional staff are credentialed in their primary teaching fields.   The staff participates annually in at least eight days of professional development that includes workshops on content and performance standards, conflict resolution, and curriculum strategies. Continuing mentoring and collaboration give teachers the opportunity to implement their developing strategies in the classroom. Grant monies from the state legislature help send staff to regional and national conferences. Teaching assistants also receive periodic training in the methods used in classrooms by teachers. Part of the schoolwide budget is set aside to encourage parents to participate in conferences, professional development activities, and staff meetings. ""We try to run an open house where parents are welcome to participate in anything going on campus,"" said Dr. Thornton.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS   Gompers embraces the whole community in its educational effort. At the beginning of the school year, teachers visit the homes, workplaces, and religious institutions of their students and families. A letter to parents makes clear the important role that parents play in students' academic success. A supplement to the San Diego student handbook welcomes families and students, tells parents about homework requirements, lists the materials students must have on hand every day, and describes the dress code. It also discusses parents' responsibilities in monitoring their children's progress toward the school's ambitious academic curriculum.   ""Our diversity is our strength,"" Dr. Thornton asserts proudly. Through an active human and race relations program, students and teachers participate in activities and seminars that develop sensitivity toward the school's many cultures and traditions. In collaboration with various national organizations and the district's integration services office, 75 students, 15 teachers, and various other staff members spent four days at Camp Minitown in the Palamar Mountains. The program fosters interpersonal relationships by teaching students to understand diversity and commonality across cultures, to challenge the stereotypes they hold, and, in doing so, to develop a respect for other cultures and ethnic groups. A teacher and a classroom aide, who completed the training, teach a course on race and human relations at Gompers.   Parent committees and an active community advisory council are essential components of the school's decision-making structure. Professionals from San Diego State University, the University of California at San Diego, and the public library advise and contribute to planning and curriculum development. Individuals from these groups also consult on financial and organizational matters and arrange private tutoring, mentors, tours, workshops, paid summer laboratory internships, and other educational opportunities for students. In addition, one business partner provides $2,000 for students to participate in competitions, another business partner funds the school's outdoor science lab, and a local science museum provides opportunities for students to preview exhibits.     Diversity is Gompers' strength. To understand that diversity, teachers visit the homes, workplaces, and religious institutions of their students and families at the beginning of the school year.   A district-sponsored parent center located on Gompers' campus provides parenting classes, ESL classes, GED preparation, and cultural awareness for self-sufficiency classes. The center attracts more than 500 parents annually. Gompers' own parent center welcomes more than 1,800 parents annually to participate in various Gompers programs, including parent days at the school, school spirit activities, and senior class parent meetings. In October 1997, more than 300 members of the Gompers community attended the grand opening of the Lincoln/Gompers Cluster Family Service Center and health fair. Staffed by a psychologist and social workers from a coalition of community-based agencies, the center gives students and their families on-campus access to health services, counseling, and early childhood programs. A Healthy Start planning grant from the California legislature promises to expand health services for students and families.      SUSTAINING CHANGE   Encouraging teachers' ideas and initiatives is one of Gompers' primary strategies for ensuring that teachers are full partners in decisionmaking. When implementing the school's new ideas and programs, Dr. Thornton delegates as much responsibility as possible to staff leaders. ""So much evolves from our teachers that [it is not difficult] to keep them going,"" said Dr. Thornton. Major teacher-led initiatives include the AVID program, KidSat, and the Wildcat Cubs-MESH (Mathematics, English, Science, History) program.     Encouraging teachers' ideas and initiatives ensures that Gompers' teachers are full partners in decisionmaking.    Like many urban schools, Gompers is located in a neighborhood troubled with gang problems, substance abuse, low incomes, and crime. Still, according to the school's annual progress report, 92 percent of Gompers' parents say they feel safe sending their children to Gompers. One reason, Dr. Thornton observed, is that faculty have ""made curriculum [improvements], increased expectations of students, staff, parents, and community and increased the demands on our human and financial resources. Throughout this [process]...the staff continues to work tirelessly in helping our students excel and achieve.""   -###-           [ Preparing Students for Real-World Experiences ]             [ Addresses for Profiled Schools ]"

GX070-09-9869513	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e dÂ Â I n f o r m a t i o n     Elementary Schools   A Standards-Based, Arts-Integrated  Schoolwide Curriculum   Worcester Arts Magnet School   Worcester Public Schools Â· Worcester, Massachusetts   OVERVIEW   Reflecting on her initial interest in the schoolwide concept, principal Margaret Venditti said, ""We were not only becoming a schoolwide, but we were designing a citywide magnet at the same time. The two efforts blended together. Suddenly, we [had the flexibility to] think about how to make the whole school a better place for learning.""  The state's ambitious academic program, defined in curriculum frameworks for every academic subject, is the focus of education at Worcester Arts. According to Venditti, the arts are the ""motivational tools and instruments with which to broaden children's understanding, skill, and knowledge."" All students, not just those targeted by a specific program, use a host of artistic experiences to achieve the state's high standards.  Worcester Arts Magnet combines federal Title I, Bilingual Education Act, and special education funds with state and local funding resources and grant awards earned competitively from numerous state and local organizations.        Located in a valley between two low-income housing communities, Worcester Arts serves students from the neighborhood and throughout the city.             Grade Levels  PreK-6       Number of Students  (1997-98)  453         Schoolwide Since  1992-93       Racial/Ethnic Composition     50% Â  White   44% Â  Hispanic   6% Â  African American           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING    The Worcester Arts program offers a balanced education for the whole child, intellectually, aesthetically, and linguistically.      A small group of school faculty, parents, and district personnel saw the promise of creating an arts magnet at Worcester. ""It was the best way to bring this school back to life,"" Venditti recalls. So ""we met and met and met,"" bringing in district and state consultants and specialists when needed to help create the kind of program the planning team envisioned. Then-Chapter I coordinator, John Corcoran, also recognized the benefits of the schoolwide program, and he worked with the design team as it hammered out its plan, a process that continued for a year. Team members distributed newsletters to parents and faculty, surveyed the parents in both Spanish and English, and urged the community to become involved. They were committed to developing a ""balanced education for the whole child, intellectually, aesthetically, and linguistically,"" using a full-inclusion model that opened learning opportunities to all children. The school continues to closely monitor assessment results and ""checks the pulse of the community regularly;"" Venditti reports they are always asking: ""Are we meeting the goals of various programs? Are we accomplishing improvement goals for students?""   A fluid steering committee works under the principal's direction to keep the Worcester Arts program running smoothly. This is a ""loose group"" of teachers and administrators, says Venditti. ""We can deal with anything, discipline, curriculum, [teachers' ideas and concerns]....It's an idea forum...a continuing needs assessment team ranging from 20 to 25 people. The size depends on the topic,"" she explains. There is also an elected body, the School Governance Council, which is composed of parents and faculty, that meets monthly to consider schoolwide issues, including budgets, school improvement matters, and student activities.     Through the School Governance Council and other school committees, teachers and parents regularly advise the principal on the budget, school improvement, and student achievement.     Teachers and parents form a powerful partnership at Worcester Arts Magnet. In 1996-97, 18 committeesâ€”each comprising a mix of teachers, support staff, administrators, and parentsâ€”undertook a self-study to attain accreditation from the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Over the course of a full year, the committees prepared a detailed status report about the school and reasserted the school's commitment to its unique integrated arts and academic program. According to the school's mission statement: ""Our faculty strives to...integrate the arts in everyday lessons [because] they help students tap into their creative strengths, raising their self-esteem and enabling them to experience both academic and artistic success.""      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS    For 1996-97, Worcester Arts Magnet achieved the state's sixth-highest relative gain in state assessment scores.    ""The term 'accountability' has hit home,"" principal Venditti reports. ""The ownership is really there. We are always asking, 'How can we prove we're successful?"" Teachers use portfolios, scored against a teacher-student developed rubric, combined with their own observations, to guide everyday instruction. In addition to standardized assessment scores, every student receives quarterly and interim report cards, twice yearly arts progress reports, and a teacher-designed checklist that keeps parents informed about students' behavior and academic progress.  The accountability orientation has so increased the faculty's commitment to using test results that, in 1996, Worcester Arts Magnet students achieved the state's sixth-highest relative gain on the Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program. Academic progress continues to grow in all other tested content areas as well. Each year, students at every grade level take a commercially developed test: the Stanford Achievement Test, the Iowa Reading Test, the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, or the new Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System. All bilingual students take the Ideal Proficiency Test and the Language Assessment Scale.  The central office prepares disaggregated test reports annually, and grade-level teaching teams scrutinize the results in light of students' portfolios and teachers' observations of student progress in their classrooms. Faculty members use these periodic analyses to redirect the academic program.  Parents receive a copy of all test results and a district-developed assessment information handbook. At periodic parent and teacher meetings on assessment, the curriculum specialist interprets the overall school and individual student's test results and helps parents understand how the school uses them on behalf of students.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES   The Worcester Arts curriculum is a faculty-designed framework of concepts and teaching processes that is oriented toward encouraging children's critical thinking, questioning, and problem solving by fully integrating the arts. These unifying principlesbased on state and national curriculum standardsare the basis of specific grade-level objectives that structure the schoolwide curriculum. Under the direction of the full-time curriculum specialist, research-based teaching strategies complement the approaches already in use. Curriculum writing teams periodically reconvene to determine whether program modifications are necessary based on the most recent student achievement results and observations from colleagues and parents.   Literacy is at the heart of the schoolwide program at Worcester Arts Magnet. Students learn to read using a ""balanced"" language arts program that teaches phonics, literature, and writing as a way for students to  better understand their world. The reading program also involves learning with parents and fellow students, poetry writing and reading, journal writing, performing, listening to stories on tapes, making charts, corresponding with pen pals, and writing and illustrating original stories. The arts teachers, along with the curriculum specialists and other support personnel, join regular classroom teachers during reading instruction so that instructional groups are as small as possible. Literacy is taught across the content areas when students study native cultures in social studies or promote a healthy community environment through their science program. Reading Recovery is available to lower-grade students who are not keeping up with their peers; a specialist in the Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Program supports readers at risk in the third and fourth grades. A creative writing specialist visits each classroom for 50 minutes a week as part of the arts block.     Curriculum writing teams periodically reconvene to determine whether program modifications are  necessary based on the most recent student achievement results and observationsfrom colleagues and parents.    Learning occurs actively at Worcester Arts. As early as preschool, students prepare performances and exhibitions and display their work in classrooms and in hallways throughout the school. Each third- through sixth-grade student produces a research project or an exhibit and discusses it at the annual Projects Fair. Some students also serve as classroom ""facilitators"" in lower-grade classrooms. As part of the ""Drop Everything and Read in School Today"" program, teachers pair ""emerging readers"" with more experienced, upper-grade readers to help struggling students improve underdeveloped reading skills.   Although Howard Gardner's research on multiple intelligences is the intellectual foundation for arts-integrated instruction at Worcester Arts, other research-based programs complement the core curriculum. After reviewing student portfolios, teachers decided that students were adept at rote mathematics but appeared to be missing broader concepts. They adopted the Number Worlds program, an interactive, hands-on mathematics program that develops mathematical skills by letting students use manipulative tools to build on their spontaneous thinking about numbers. Dimensions of Learning and the Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) Laboratory promote problem-centered teaching and learning and support students who require more direct lessons on how to use their analytical thinking more effectively.     Learning occurs actively at Worcester Arts. Beginning in preschool, students share ""expeditions"" with one another and with parents through performances or through displays in classrooms and throughout the school's hallways. Both parents and students become involved in reading and writing poetry, journal writing, and corresponding with pen pals through the Internet.     The physical environment is the organizing theme for the science curriculum. Students study recycling as the content theme but they apply scientific concepts through the arts program. Some examples of activities that students undertake in science include recycling materials to design and build a robot, writing poetry about recycling and setting poems to music, and sharing what they learn about the environment in their projects, their poetry, and their music. In the upper grades, students use Science Through Experimental Procedures to conduct experiments and keep journals detailing what they learn each day.   Each grade level is fully staffed with certified teachers, supported by certified bilingual and special education teachers and classroom assistants. All teachers co-teach to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios. Worcester Arts supports a growing population of Spanish-speaking students with ESL and bilingual classes. To help non-English-speakers achieve the same high standards as other students, the bilingual program coordinates its learning objectives, scope and sequence charts, and lesson plans with the other teachers. Bilingual students use native language textbooks that mirror those used in the student program; that way, when they transition out of bilingual classes, their core knowledge of the major disciplines is on the same level as their English-fluent peers.     All teachers co-teach to reduce pupil-to-teacher ratios.    A student support team, including the principal, the curriculum specialist, and current and former classroom teachers, is available to students facing continuing academic risks. Together the team identifies specific weaknesses and, after consultation with parents, determines how to help the student overcome the identified problems. Some possible solutions may include additional time for mathematics or reading instruction, a small instructional group setting for a particular subject area, or psychological testing for specific learning disabilities.      THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY    Staff development is one of the sustaining forces at Worcester Arts. ""We're using a supportive model, not just one-shot programs,"" Principal Margaret Venditti explains.     Venditti considers staff development one of the sustaining forces at Worcester Arts. ""We're using a supportive model, not just one-shot programs,"" she explains. Worcester Arts Magnet employs 32 full-time staff members, most of whom are continually involved in extending their own learning. The school's plan for professional development encourages staff to work collaboratively on a common goal and to share any knowledge acquired in the many workshops, conferences, and courses they attend. In a typical year, faculty participate in more than 40 different courses and workshops. More than half of the staff have been working on their masters' degree or, in some cases, have received a second or third masters' degree since they joined the faculty. Three staff members were awarded a sabbatical year at Harvard University and returned to the school to share the results of their studies or introduce the programs they initiated while on leave.  Teachers' areas of expertise include elementary education, the arts and cognition, special education, creative arts in learning, administration, planning, and social policy. One teacher participated in a museum education project to help kindergartners develop observation and experimentation skills through art. One of the Harvard scholars focused her studies on parent involvement and conducted workshops increasing parent involvement through decisionmaking and participation. Other workshops that Worcester Arts Magnet staff attended have addressed family involvement in children's education, classroom management, parenting, family literacy, and an introduction to  using Macintosh computers. As staff participate in citywide assessment workshops, they return to share their knowledge with their colleagues. Finally, preschool and kindergarten teachers' participation in the National Association for the Education of Young Children's accreditation program eventually resulted in the accreditation of  the Worcester Arts early childhood program.     In a typical year, faculty participate in more than 40 different courses and workshops. More than half of the staff have been working on their masters' degree or, in some cases, have received a second or third masters' degree since they joined the faculty.    Professional development at Worcester Arts is based on individual as well as building-level needs. New teachers are brought into the traditions of the arts-integrated approach by collegial mentors, and the school continually surveys the staff to assess areas in which they need additional training. New staff ""need the opportunities to become as proficient as othersâ€”especially in the arts and how to integrate them throughout the curriculum,"" Venditti explains. Evaluation is also integral to the professional development process. In the fall, as part of the annual staff evaluation, Venditti and each staff member review the past year's achievements and set new professional development goals for the coming year.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS    The doors are open at Worcester Arts early in the morning and late into the night. An arts-centered extended day program provides afterschool opportunities for students to participate in a wide array of arts programs.    Parents have been essential to the program's continuing success, Venditti proudly reports. The magnet concept was initiated by 17 families, and the school now brings more than half of its students from outside of the school boundaries. More than 200 families volunteer their time in various school activities: they help substitute in classes during staff development days, read to children, organize book fairs, sew costumes, and assist with many arts activities. The school's Parent Teacher Organization also provides each teacher with $150 to conduct field trips or  purchase supplementary materials for their classrooms.   The doors are open at Worcester Arts early in the morning and late into the night. The extended day for students provides one hour of extra time for special arts, music, and drama activities, including a student chorus and instrument lessons. A Community Partnerships Grant provides child care for families who work or attend school for 30 hours a week. This collaborative serves up to 20 preschoolers through third-graders and  is open on school vacations and school delay days.   Fliers in both Spanish and English invite parents to attend school meetings, where babysitting is available for children without other adult-supervised care. A bilingual staff member interprets for parents who do not speak English, and she often conveys their concerns to the school's various governance councils. In addition to the fliers and periodic information sheets, the principal and teachers each write and distribute newsletters to the community. A monthly calendar featuring field trips, special programs, and other events is also available in English and Spanish.  Worcester Arts' bilingual counselor and psychologist assist students and their families, and, in preparation for preschool, a bilingual family liaison conducts home visits to families with two-year-olds.   Community service is important to the staff and to the school community. Some examples of annual activities for students and their families include a bottle and can drive to raise money for Thanksgiving Baskets, a holiday fair to raise money for a local project supplying gifts to needy families, and a canned goods drive to help a local food bank. The staff and students assist at the Medical Center of Central Massachusetts. Parents and children fill ""love bowls"" with candy every month for patients receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatments. They also decorate monthly bulletin boards in the patient waiting area. The school values this exchange, ""a bridge to life outside of school,"" because it instills in students a sense of responsibility and commitment to the broader community.      SUSTAINING CHANGE   Principal Venditti reports that one of her greatest challenges is ""keeping up with the vast amount of research on teaching and learning...to make sure you don't just hop on the bandwagon because something is in vogue, but because you know that it works...and that it is based on a solid foundation of research...."" District-level expertise has been crucial in building a research-based program. Most recently, the district office has offered programs on balancing literacy through phonics, whole language, and student assessment, including portfolio and other authentic assessments.     Keeping up with the rapidly advancing research on teaching and learning is a major challenge to sustaining the momentum at Worcester Arts Magnet.    It is hard to keep a collaborative organization moving, Venditti acknowledges. ""It takes so much time to involve people, it's hard to schedule, and teachers are tired."" But she takes pleasure in the degree to which people rally around the school. Parents and teachers feel joint ownership of the school's major plans and activities, and the faculty has been very stable. Worcester Arts' administrative approach combines dedication and patience with two basic organizational principles: meetings that have tight agendas and a system for implementing what has been planned together. The process works well, confirms Barbara Ann Masley, the curriculum coordinator who chaired the school's self-study. According to her introduction to the school's accreditation report, at Worcester Arts Magnet, the community has created a school where ""the whole is much larger than the sum of the parts.""   -###-           [ A Beacon of Excellence ]             [ Secondary Schools ]"
GX070-12-0433851	"Profiles of Successful Schoolwide Programs - December 1998     A r c h i v e dÂ Â I n f o r m a t i o n     Elementary Schools   Ensuring Success for All Students   Lincoln WorldLab Magnet Elementary School   Palm Beach County Public Schools Â· Riviera Beach, Florida   OVERVIEW    An emphasis on early academic intervention, a strong, coherent curriculum, and coordinated instructional strategies ensure that students at Lincoln Elementary School meet or exceed grade-level benchmarks by the time they enter the sixth grade. ""If we can reach students early, we can solve any problem,"" said Penny Collins, a literacy resource teacher who works with kindergartners and first-graders. In this cooperative learning atmosphere, students achieve at the highest academic levels while developing positive attitudes toward themselves and their peers.   Lincoln's schoolwide program, first implemented in 1993-94, uses Success For All (SFA), MathWings, and WorldLab, the three coordinated curricula developed by the Center for the Education of Students Placed at Risk (CRESPAR) at Johns Hopkins University. Having these curricula at the core of the schoolwide program has successfully minimized the fragmentation in this very large kindergarten-through-fifth-grade school that serves a largely African American, Haitian, and Hispanic student population. Extensive on-site professional development that continues within the school day promotes a common instructional philosophy and teaching style across classrooms. It works, says Penny Collins, because ""students receive the same signals from [all the] teachers,"" and all instruction is structured similarly.   In its schoolwide budget, Lincoln combines federal resources from the Title I, Title V-Magnet, and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs, with funding from the Florida lottery and other state and local resources. According to principal Margaret Brockmiller, becoming a schoolwide program meant using all available funds more effectively. The result was that, without labeling, all students benefit from focused, specialized instruction.         Lincoln serves a predominantly nonwhite student population, 87% of whom qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.             Grade Levels  PreK-5       Number of Students  (1997-98)  1,181         Schoolwide Since  1993-94       Racial/Ethnic Composition     92% Â  African American   7% Â  Hispanic/White/Other           VISION, LEADERSHIP, AND DECISION MAKING    Lincoln faculty members are full participants in decisionmaking.  The school's improvement plan for 1997-98 includes a comprehensive  monitoring structure that outlines their roles and responsibilities to ensure  that school improvement strategies are implemented.      Two representative decision-making bodies, a faculty council and a school, parent, and community advisory committee, coordinate to review and update the school's improvement plan periodically.     Decision making occurs through two representative structuresâ€”a faculty council from each grade and the School Advisory Committee (SAC). The faculty council meets with the principal twice monthly to discuss the school's day-to-day organizational needs and strategies for integrating the research-based reform programs with other schoolwide activities. The SAC, which meets monthly, is chaired by a parent, co-chaired by the principal, and includes parents, teachers, noninstructional staff, community members, and administrators. At least 10 members represent parents or the community, including one designated representative from the school's large Haitian community. The SAC works by consensus to maintain an updated school improvement plan. The state allocates $10 per child for the SAC to spend on school improvement activities.      STUDENT PERFORMANCE RESULTS     In 1997, 29% of students scored in the top two quartiles of the CTBS test in reading, and 43% reached these levels in mathematics.    Student performance at Lincoln is measured through eight-week SFA and MathWings instructional assessments and by state-mandated standardized tests. Teachers submit continual improvement reports to the principal every nine weeks to track student progress. They also inform parents about student progress in quarterly report cards and interim progress reports with detailed information about individuals' skill development and changing academic needs.   Each year students in grades three through five take the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (CTBS) in the spring, and fourth-graders take the Florida Writing Assessment in February. The CTBS scores provide longitudinal data on individual students for three years. Between 1994 and 1997, the percent of students performing above the 50th percentile rose significantly in both reading and mathematics. In reading, the number of students above the 50th percentile rose from 18 to 29 percent during the three-year period; in mathematics, the percent jumped from 17 to  43. Based on data compiled from these scores, the school writes an annual curriculum plan, identifying areas of the test not sufficiently emphasized by the school's instructional program. Lincoln's scores on the Florida Writing Assessment have also increased steadily since 1994. Between 1994 and 1997, scores climbed from 1.6 to 2.5 on the narrative portion of the test and from 1.4 to 2.0 on the expository portion of the test. Both components are measured on a one-to-six scale. Every eight weeks, the SFA instructional assessments provide diagnostic information that teachers, in consultation with SFA facilitators, use to restructure reading groups according to appropriate skill levels.      RESEARCH-BASED REFORM STRATEGIES   The three instructional programs developed by CRESPAR and Johns Hopkins University researchersâ€”SFA, MathWings, and WorldLabâ€”guide reading, mathematics, social studies, and science instruction in grades one through five. The programs are aligned with Florida's Sunshine State Standards, and although each one is distinct, they are integrated across subject areas and grade levels, fitting together ""like a puzzle,"" reports principal Brockmiller.      Three Johns Hopkins-developed instructional programs, Success For All, MathWings, and WorldLab structure a coordinated academic curriculum that is fully aligned with Florida's Sunshine State Standards.     Success For All (SFA) . SFA structures the reading program for students across all grades. Homogeneous groups of students participate in daily, 120-minute uninterrupted reading and language arts instructional blocks. The SFA curriculum focuses on teaching comprehension, listening, speaking, and vocabulary skills, through multicultural stories that reflect students' cultures and heritages. The model uses literature to involve students personally in reading and to enhance their understanding of the story structures. Students learn to listen to, retell, and dramatize children's literature; to compose ideas orally and in writing; and to decode letters and sounds to support their advancing reading knowledge. SFA is a continual progress model in which students learn cooperatively. Students progress across achievement levels as they master certain skills, and they also develop the ability to assess their own progress and to correct their errors as they read and write. For students experiencing difficulty, tutoring and additional academic support services are immediately available so they can proceed through the reading program as quickly as their improving language skills will allow.  MathWings . The MathWings program gives students the opportunity to discover, experiment with, and apply their mathematical knowledge following the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' Curriculum and Evaluation Standards. Mathematics activities build on the practical mathematics knowledge students have when they enter school and incorporate real and simulated problem solving, skill practice, calculator use, alternative assessments, writing, and connections to literature and other disciplines. Students learn to apply multiple-problem solutions and then describe this new knowledge in their own mathematics journals. MathWings is cyclical; students at each grade level review and build on what they learned the previous year until they achieve mastery.    WorldLab . WorldLab is Lincoln's integrated science and social studies program in which students use written work, role playing, and cooperative teams to carry out experiments, investigations, and science and social studies projects. WorldLab adopts the same instructional strategies as does the overall SFA and MathWings programs. The program, written on various skill levels, revolves around thematic units that incorporate writing, reading, mathematics, fine arts, and music into the science and social studies curriculum.      Across all content areas, students learn cooperatively and individually to achieve mastery. Students learn to assess their own progress and they develop the habit of correcting their own errors before moving ahead.     Early childhood learning opportunities.  Teachers in Lincoln's prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms learn the SFA methods through the same training programs their colleagues participated in. It focuses on providing a balanced and developmentally appropriate learning experience for children emphasizing the development and use of language, music, art, and movement activities in a series of thematic units. This consistency  of the preschool and kindergarten programs facilitates students' preparation for the first grade. Lincoln also uses the Breakthrough to Literacy Language Development Program, an interactive computer-based language  development curriculum for kindergartners and selected first-graders. Each day, students explore words, letters, and sounds on computer programs aligned with all other academic components. Teachers use the same programs to continually assess students' reading progress.    Support services to students . Reteaching students who struggle to make progress through the progressively more difficult learning cycles is an important component of all aspects of SFA, and this concept carries over to all academic disciplines at Lincoln. Students receive various supplementary support services, including tutoring by specially trained paraprofessionals, drop-out prevention assistance, and mentoring through the program HOSTSâ€”Help One Student To Succeed, which targets students in grades three through five. Those who score in the lowest quartile on the CTBS receive additional one-to-one instruction each day from one of four diagnostically trained full-time tutors. Students in the highest quartile on the CTBS may participate in the county's Structures of Intellect (SOI) curriculum, which helps eligible students prepare for the district's Gifted and Talented program. Parents are an essential part of the formula for success in SFA.   The research-based reform programs at Lincoln accommodate all students, especially those at risk, because teachers continually reassess and regroup students according to their educational needs. For designated students with limited-English proficiency, a full-time ESL teacher provides additional assistance, supplementing classroom reading instruction in the morning and individually tutoring selected students in the afternoon.   All students have access to mental health services through the support of Lincoln's Family Support Team. Two assistant principals also help resolve conflicts and organize peer mediation sessions on campus. Lincoln's discipline plan features conflict resolution and encourages the school's ""Fight Free"" program to help students implement the schoolwide motto, ""Celebrating Peace Every Day.""      THE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITY   Lincoln's 89 teachers and 71 support and administrative staff bring a wealth of expertise to students. A multitalented professional team includes reading specialists; SFA, MathWings, and WorldLab facilitators; more than 20 special educators; art, music, physical education, computer, and ESL teachers; a counselor; and a social worker. Well-trained paraprofessionals assist professionals in implementing all aspects of the program. A parent liaison and three dropout prevention teachers are part of the overall support for students and families.      We help teachers question themselves by making them aware of what they're doing and not doing. They're constantly checking and rechecking their teaching against assessments of students' progress.   Penny Collins  Teacher Facilitator  Lincoln Elementary    When Lincoln initially adopted the CRESPAR/Hopkins programs, all staff received two weeks of intensive preparatory training on how to use the materials and the strategies incorporated into the research-based program. Professional development continues to be available from in-school and regional facilitators. Lincoln's two in-school facilitatorsâ€”one who supports SFA and one who supports both MathWings and WorldLabâ€”work with teachers to examine students' progress summary data, structure teaching around students' needs, determine the effectiveness of lessons, and, in the case of SFA, arrange students into homogeneous reading groups. Every eight weeks, facilitators issue checklists to teachers with information on each program component to help ensure that instruction is data-driven. According to facilitator Penny Collins, ""[We] help teachers question themselves and make them aware of what they're doing and not doing. They're constantly checking and rechecking [their teaching against assessments of students' progress]."" SFA-sponsored network facilitators who work in the region conduct periodic implementation checks and provide continuous feedback to the principal based on summary information about student performance.   In addition to training and support in the research-based SFA models, professional development opportunities at Lincoln include the Early Literacy Inservice Course (ELIC) for primary teachers, Professional Orientation Program mentors for new teachers, grade-level discussions, and early release days so that teachers can attend in-service courses on conflict resolution, writing, alternative assessments, inclusion, and test-taking preparation.      PARENT AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS   Lincoln is deeply committed to fostering parent and community involvement in students' lives. Parents are invited to participate in several educational opportunities at the school, including the Parent Power and Parent Power Kids program, adult education/GED preparation classes, and MegaSkills parenting classes. The Parent Power program helps parents prepare young children to enter school by modeling instruction in a class for three- and four-year-olds. These and other parent involvement activities occur weekly at Lincoln, scheduled at various times throughout the day and evening.      A Family Support Team conducts home visits, directs parents to appropriate agency services, and, when necessary, intervenes into situations at home or at school that negatively affect students' learning.    Lincoln's Family Support Team, including Lincoln's social worker, principal, counselor, and psychologist, is a vital component of the SFA model that provides an array of services to families. The team, headed by the school's social worker, visits families of students who are exhibiting behavioral, health, or academic problems; steers families toward agencies that can assist; conducts parent outreach; plans interventions for non-school situations that affect learning; and issues attendance plans for students who have a less than 95 percent attendance rate. When needed, the Family Support Team reviews information relevant to each student; discusses the needs with the student's teacher; and identifies a case manager for each family. Lincoln's parent liaison also assists the team in contacting parents and enlisting their cooperation.   The Lincoln staff reach beyond the school to familieâ€”seven to those who are unable to visit the school. They use a number of communication devices: a parent compact, a daily calendar of student work and responsibilities referred to as a ""student agenda,"" and calendars of school events. Updated information about individual students facilitates the ongoing dialogue between parents and teachers, keeping the school and families tightly linked in support of students. Each day, students leave school with a progress report for parents that includes teachers' comments about their achievement. Parents are encouraged to talk with their students about the report and to respond with comments or questions. Quarterly curriculum nights, featuring grade-level presentations by the faculty, are a forum for parents to learn about curriculum content and instructional activities and to ask questions about testing. Parent-teacher conferences, held twice a year, take place at the school or over the telephone. Lincoln reports all assessment results to parents, including the results of both standardized and SFA tests. Written materials released by Lincoln are translated into Spanish, and an interpreter is available to Haitian families.      SUSTAINING CHANGE     The changes Lincoln initiated in the schoolwide program are sustained by a common instructional philosophy, an understanding of what is taught in other classrooms, and a commitment to all students achieving the same high standards.    Lincoln staff report that the changes initiated by the schoolwide program are sustained by a common instructional philosophy,an understanding of what is taught in other classrooms, and a commitment to all students achieving the same high standards. Coordinating Lincoln's magnet and schoolwide programs dramatically improved the resources available to the school, principal Brockmiller reported. The research-based curriculum engages students with familiar and active experiences. It is taught similarly across all subjects by skillful master teachers who ensure their colleagues have the support they need to implement the program effectively. The Family Support Team is also an essential part of the program's success. Collaboration within and across the grades keeps the program integrated schoolwide, enabling Lincoln to stand forcefully behind its commitment to ""Success For All.""   -###-           [ Academic Success Through a ""Full Service"" School ]             [ Commitment to Teacher Development ]"

Often even a good quality educational program            is not sufficiently challenging for a student with special gifts or            talents. The GATE funds are used to design and deliver a supplemental            differentiated program for individuals or groups of gifted and talented            students with special needs.                        Overview             In 1961, the California Legislature established the mentally gifted            minor (MGM) program for students scoring in the 98th percentile or above            on standardized intellectual ability tests. By 1980, 454 school districts            and 160,000 students were participating in the program. AB 1040, enacted            in 1980, established the GATE program allowing districts to set their            own criteria for entrance. It expanded service beyond the intellectually            gifted to students who were gifted, talented, or both in areas such            as specific academic ability, leadership, visual and performing arts,            and creativity.                         Currently, GATE programs are operated by 806 districts in California,            located in 58 counties. Approximately 425,653 public school students            have been identified as gifted and talented for the 2001-02 school year.            Participants in these programs compare favorably with students across            the nation and internationally when provided differentiated instruction            commensurate with their abilities and talents.                         Districts may elect to apply for GATE funding. Their applications may            be approved by the State Board of Education for up to five years. To            qualify for funding, districts must have an approved GATE plan. State            Law (AB 2313, effective January 1, 2001) requires that primary services            for gifted and talented students be integrated into the regular school            day.                            Objectives           Districts use GATE funds as a catalyst to start and maintain challenging            programs for gifted and talented students. High school districts use            GATE funding to start Advanced Placement (AP), honors, or International            Baccalaureate (IB) programs. After a year of GATE funding support, the            enrollment is usually sufficient to generate average daily attendance            (a.d.a.), and GATE funding is then used to start up another course.                     The GATE funding is also used to counsel economically disadvantaged            high potential students to ensure that they are enrolled in courses            which provide a foundation for college entrance. In rural areas, where            perhaps only one or two students are ready for an advanced course, GATE            funding is used for distance learning programs such as Stanford University's            Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY), which offers college level            courses on CD-ROM to middle and high-school age youth.                         At the elementary, middle, and secondary levels, GATE funding supports            the provision of services that are integrated into the regular school            day as differentiated learning experiences based on the core curriculum.            GATE funding also supports supplementary services such as pullout classes,            extended day classes, intercession opportunities, or Saturday seminars.                                    At all levels, GATE funding is used for staff development to provide            teachers with strategies to broaden or deepen their instruction, accelerate            programs, or design individual programs to meet students' needs. GATE            funding is often used to send teachers to AP or IB training. The regular            classroom teacher, with GATE students included in class, benefits from            training in instructional techniques which improve the quality of learning            for all students while stimulating our most able students.
