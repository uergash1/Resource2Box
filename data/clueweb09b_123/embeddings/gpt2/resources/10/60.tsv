FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba   One of the most frustrating things about taking care of our homes is when it seems as though you need a bunch of different cleaning brushes and products to do several things.  Recently we found this rubber brush and discovered how multi-purpose it really is.  Kelly went so crazy for it she insisted we had to carry it in the Fly Shop.  Here is how Kelly describes FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba!   I have dogs and kids, this means dog hair and crumbs every where, all the time.  I have been on a personal mission for years of just how to get the dog hair off the furniture.  (Yes, I know I should train them to not get on the couch but they are members of the family)  In my search I came across this rubber brush.  It wasn't that expensive so I figured I had nothing to lose but hair so I gave it a try.  I was so shocked!!  I had just vacuumed the couches earlier that day so I was not thinking that there was going to be too much to try but wanted to get the feel of how it worked.  I could not believe how much hair came off the couch that I could not see and given that I had just vacuumed.  I stood there with it in my hand and tried to figure out why it worked so well compared to all of the other things I had tried.  If you ever had long hair you will understand.  If you use a rubber band on your hair to make a pony tail, it is really painful because of how the rubber grabs and pulls the hair.  I was so thrilled, then as a joke I brushed one of the dogs with it and to my surprise the dog was so happy;  I was able to grab all the loose hair on him and it did not hurt him.  Over the next few days I realized the uses of the brush were endless.  I used it as a whisk broom with a dust pan, to scrub the tracks in a shower door, to go along the baseboards where carpet meets the wall, I even used it to wash dishes - even better - just toss it in the top rack of the dishwasher to sanitize it!!  I am telling you that this is hands down one of the neatest tools I have in my home now.  I can use ONE item to do so much! I have decluttered a bunch of sponges, scrubbing brushes and whisk broom  and have replaced it with this Rubba Scrubba! It is amazing! - Kelly   FlyLady's Rubba Scrubba is 10 1/2 inches in length and 1 1/2 inches wide across the brush head.

Following the instructions in this sewing project you            sew  bra without underwire . This kind of a bra can be nearly as            tight-fitting as a bra with underwire, but it is much easier to sew.            Furthermore, you do not need to get the underwires which might be difficult.           Patterns           The patterns for a bra without underwire can be drafted            with the measurements of the basic sloper and a couple of additional            measurements which are easy to take. For bra with underwire much more            measurements are needed and they are not always very easy to take.           If            you have PatternMaker Home or one of the other CAD versions of the program,            you can use the patterns just like you would use any other PatternMaker            patterns. You can alter them, join them to other PatternMaker patterns            etc. You could - for example - join the bra patterns to the patterns            of panties to get patterns for a bodysuit (more about this below).           You get the cups in two versions, horizontal and vertical            cut. You can later on make new cup designs using these basic patterns.            To read more about the cup designs, please refer to the  sewing            instructions page for lingerie  on this site.           Notions           As closures  you can in stead of the hook-and-eye            tape use zipper, buttons, Velcro or plastic closures sold for swimwear            bikini tops. The closures can be applied to the back or to the front            of the bra according to your wishes.            As            fabric  you can use normal lingerie tricot or jersey. I suggest you            use elastic fabric. Part of the cup can be sewn of stretchy lace or            lace fabric. You can apply decorations, such as a bow, flower or lace            appliqués. For ideas refer to the  sewing            projects  for camisole and panties on this site. To get a firm band,            the midriff part should always be sewn of double fabric.            Note!  To be able to sew a test garment, always             buy extra fabric . The notions can be detached from the test garment            and used for the final garment.           Furthermore you need  lingerie edge elastic . When            you buy it, check that it restores the original length after stretching            it. There are a lot of bad quality elastic available. Consider an alternative            to use elastic of contrasting color, that might be the only decoration            needed for your bra. You can also use normal narrow elastic and sew            it under the edge of the garment. If you use lace or lace fabric for            some parts of the bra, it usually is advisable to strengthen its edge            with transparent elastic (Framilon). Read more about edge elastics and            the techniques to attaching them in the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.           If you want to sew  padded bra  choose the horizontal            cutting option for the cup and sew the bottom half of the cup of double            fabric. You can the bottom of the cup or the entire cup and you can            add padding between the lining and the bra, if you want to. The simpliest            way of making padded bra is to cut the cups from padded fabric.                     Ready made band is sold for  shoulder straps.  You            can also make the shoulder straps yourself. For ideas and sewing techniques,            please refer to the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.            Hint : Using two spaghetti shoulder straps for            both sides of the bra may look nice. To get instructions of how to sew            spaghetti shoulder straps, please refer to the  sewing            project for camisole  and the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site. You can also sew a fabric            tube and insert elastic into it. Stretch the elastic inside the tube            and topstitch the tube with 3 stitch or narrow, medium long zigzag e.g.            from the distance of the presser foot from both edges.            Always sew a test garment                       Sewing bra is much easier than you ever have thought. Nevertheless,            always sew a test garment first. It is necessary to check the fitting            of the patterns and the scaling factors used to reduce the patterns            in size. If you are not used to sew lingerie, sewing a test garment            also lets you exercise the sewing techniques.            If the test garment does not fit well, check which pattern            pieces have to be changed and how much. Be critical. The aim is to get            Very Good Bra Patterns for you to be used in many sewing projects. In            the picture to the left you see a test garment. Even if the bra feels            all right when worn by the subject and could be used as such, the fitting            is not optimal and the patterns need to be changed accordingly.           After having got good bra patterns for your figure you            will be able to sew luxurious bra with perfect fit in a couple of hours.            After you have learned the sewing techniques it may be worth while investing            in more expensive fabrics and laces. And once you have used bra sewn            to your own measurements, you never again want to wear anything else.            This is especially true with women who have a prominent bust and who            need extra support for it but find it difficult to get well-fitting            ready made bra.           Cutting           If you choose the horizontal cut option for the cups,            cut the  bottom pieces  so that the direction of stretch of the            fabric is  horizontal . Cut the top piece of the cup so that the            direction of stretch of the fabric is vertical. The top pieces of the            cups can also be cut from lace or lace fabric. If you make the entire            cup of lace, consider lining it with elastic gauze sold for this purpose            (e.g. under trade mark Spandex).                                           Cut the  midriff pieces in two copies  of elastic fabric.           Sewing           Sew the seams with narrow (1-1.5 mm), medium long (2-3 mm) zigzag or            serger. Trim seam allowances near stitches if necessary. Use 3 stitch            zigzag or narrow (1-1,5 mm), medium long (2-3 mm) zigzag to topstitch.           Always  machine baste  the seams first. After you see that the            seam is all right you can finish it with zigzag. It is almost impossible            to unravel zigzag neatly. You do not need to unravel the machine basting            stitches, they will break when you use the garment and wear away.                     Sew            the midriff pieces together at bottom edge ( picture 1A ) and at            front center top edge ( picture 1B ), right side against right            side. Turn the piece right side out and topstitch with 3-stitch zigzag            along these edges.            Sew dividing seam of cups ( picture 1C ) and topstitch.            Be careful not to stretch the seams when topstitching. Loosen the pressure            of the presser foot a bit if necessary.           If you apply  bones  to the bra band, sew casings            for them to the midriff piece according to markings on the patterns            - or to places where you want to have them. You can draw guiding lines            to the wrong side of the bra band with pencil ( picture 2A ). The            marks will vanish when the bra is washed for the first time.           You can buy webbed plastic with caps called  Rigilene             for the boning purpose ( picture 2B ).           The            boning must end 1/2"" to 3/4"" from each end of the finished            seams. ( picture 2C ). Topstitch Rigilene with 3 stitch zigzag            on the right side of the garment. Bartack at both ends to make sure            that the band does not move in the casing when the garment is worn.            The ends of Rigilene tape are very sharp and can break the fabric. Caps            are therefore recommended.           Finish top edges of cups with edge elastics from the CF end of the            cup dividing seam (if horizontal cutting) or from the mark in the pattern            (if vertical cutting) to the place where shoulder straps are fastened            (marked in the patterns) ( picture 3A ). For applying edge elastic            please refer to the  sewing            instructions  for lingerie on this site.           Fasten cups to midriff piece ( picture 3B ), matching notches            on cup seams to midriff piece. Stretch midriff piece when sewing. If            you want the seam to be very neat you can cover it with bias tape. If            you want to do that, sew the unfolded bias tape into the seam matching            raw edges, trim seam allowance, fold bias tape on top of the seam and            edgestitch along other edge (folded). Sew very carefully, the stitch            line must stay at same distance from and parallel to the cup seam ( picture            to the right ).           Finish bottom edges of back panels with edge elastics. Sew back panels            to cup/midriff part ( picture 3C ) and finish seam allowances with            bias tape if you want to.                                                       Finally, finish the top edges of the back panels (leaving the shoulder            straps between the elastic and the back panel) and the cups top edges            not yet finished with edge elastic ( picture 3D ). Leave excess            elastic at the cup corners.            Fasten  hook-and-eye tape  or other kind of closures to the ends            of the back panels ( picture 4 ). Put the bra on and check the            correct length of the shoulder straps by pinning them to their places            at the top edges of the cups. Fasten shoulder straps to the cups with            two horizontal stitch lines. Fold the excess elastic you left at the            cup corners under the shoulder straps.                                              Hint:  When you are sewing a test garment, sew the hook-and-eye            tape and the shoulder straps lightly to their places with normal sewing            machine stitches and use the bra for a couple of days. After you have            noticed that the bra feels comfortable, strengthen the fastening with            zigzag. If you find it necessary to change the length or the place of            the shoulder straps or the length of the bra band, you can still do            it easily. Hook-and-eye tape and ready made shoulder straps also are            too expensive to be thrown away with a useless test garment.                     Hint:  Shoulder straps may stretch in use and therefore I            recommend that you apply adjusting mechanism to the shoulder straps            ( picture 5 ). Look at your old bra to see how the mechanism is            applied to the shoulder strap. The easiest way to fasten the rings to            the cups is to fold the extra elastic left at the bra top edge to the            wrong side and put the ring in between. Fasten the elastic to the cup            with two horizontal stitch lines.           Other            ideas to use bra patterns           Lengthen the bra band to waist and join the patterns to            the patterns of panties. You'll get patterns for a  bodysuit .            If you do not have the pant patterns you can use the miniature patterns            included in the  panties'            sewing project  on this site or order them from me. Make a hook-and-eye            fastening construction at the crotch of the pants - that way you do            not need to undress the entire bodysuit when you pop in the ladies'            room.            Sew a waist length bra of e.g. denim and use it under a jacket as a            summer top. Or sew it of festive fabric and use it with a long or a            short evening skirt, maybe with a bolero.

Temperatures during the Winter range from 30-70 degrees. Temperatures in Summer range from 70-100 degrees. Currently I'm planting a garden and need the following types of plants. I want information on where I can order seeds for the plants I can describe, as well as pictures of the plants themselves.   The first type of plants I want are plants that do good in lots of water/soak up lots of water (essentially plants that can be used for drainage).  Have you ever seen brownstones in New York? They always have really cool vines growing on them that gives a sense of natural elegance. I'm looking for vines that are similar (though I know because I live in Houston they cannot be exactly the same) and that would be able to grow vertically onto a fence.  Plants that can grow with lots of shade, and constant blockage from Sun.

When shaded though, it will climb up and over adjacent shrubs and trees to heights of more than 20 ft (6.1 m) in its quest for sunlight.?  http://www.floridata.com/ref/G/gelsem.cfm    Star Jasmine     ?Star jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides), a tender evergreen vine often grown as a groundcover, requires some shade in hot regions. Star jasmine produces perfumed pure-white star-shaped blooms in summer. Trim it with hedge shears after it flowers to keep plants low and bushy. Star jasmine is hardy to Zone 9.?  http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/pf_vines/article/0,2029,DIY_14174_2269765,00.html     Bower Vine    This site says Bower Vine requires sun, and grows 6 feet. I can tell you that the east wall of my house is covered with pink bower vines, and they are lovely. Part of my vines are in 95% shade, and part are in full sun. We ran some strings up to the roof and the vines grew along them; they had already grown up the stucco wall about 8 feet before we gave them something to hold onto. We then strung plastic garden netting over the north facing wall of our yard and the vines grew all over. I am in love with Bower vines.     The first year, they grew slowly, but after the second year, they grew faster, but not fast. They are not fast growing, but they bloom most of the year in my southwest home.  http://davesgarden.com/pf/go/1079/index.html      This site has information on Bower Vines that is more consistent with  my experience.  http://www.desert-tropicals.com/Plants/Bignoniaceae/Pandorea_jasminoides.html   Photos ://www.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&q=bower+vine&btnG=Search      Creeping Fig Sun to partial shade Category: Vines and Climbers Height: 30-40 ft.

Keep plants' tips pinched back to encourage bushy, full growth. Impatiens, popular shade-loving annuals, can also help highlight dark areas of the garden.  At planting time Karen suggests adding blood meal and bone meal to the soil. Blood meal is a natural source of nitrogen, and bone meal provides phosphorous. After planting, mulch around plants with ground bark. Mulching helps reduce weed growth, retain soil moisture and give the garden an attractive finished look. Add a fountain to drown traffic noise, and you've created an oasis in the shade.?  http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/pf_vines/article/0,2029,DIY_14174_2269765,00.html     Coleus Mosaic Kong ?Unique pattern of bright green, shades of red and cream.
