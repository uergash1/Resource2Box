To view a map graphic of the images       1993-94 SPOTView Panchromatic Imagery   In 1995, several State, federal, and local agencies purchased 1993-94 SPOTView    Panchromatic Imagery. We have negotiated the same licensing and distribution    arrangement for this dataset as for the 1998-2000 imagery.  Those interested    in conducting change detection may want to consider acquiring this imagery as    well.

The images have all been reprojected to the California Albers Projection, NAD 83 datum, and provided in GeoTiff format.   The source Landsat image files upon which these images are based can be accessed at  Landsat images  .   The file naming convention of all CalView images is as follows:          l7_ppprrrYYYYMMDDbBB(B) where:           l7          = Landsat-7 mission           ppp         = starting path of the product           rrr         = starting row of the product           YYYYMMDD    = acquisition date of the image           BB(B)       = band      In the filename, the part containing l7_ppprrrYYYYMMDD is known as the id of the image. The part after the id identifies the specific band(s) of the image.   The monochromatic bands are: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 61, 62, 70, 80.    The composite bands are: 321 (true-color image) and 457 (false-color image).   For instance: l7_4403420010930b61.tif describes a Landsat scene at Path/Row 44034, acquired on September 30, 2001. This GeoTiff image contains band 61 (near infrared).     The CalView images can be accessed in several ways:   The user can quickly access all the images we have created by accessing the  all  subdirectory.   The user can also access the images via the following classifications:         by_band  - The images are organized according to one of the nine available bands. Composite images can also be accessed here     by_id  - The images are organized according to their id, as described above     by_path_row  - The images are first organized by their path/row, followed by the full date of when the images are acquired     by_year  - The images are organized by year. Currently the acquired images span between the years of 1999 and 2002, inclusive       Images composed of three bands (composite images) can be found in  composite   Preview images for the GeoTiff images can be found in  preview  . They are also included in the above classification directories   A mosaic comprised of the CalView landsat images can be found in  mosaic   For a comprehensive description of the Landsat Data Sets, please refer to the following page:  Landsat Data Sets   The following map illustrates CalView's Landsat coverage by Path/Row:                                                                                                                                                Back to Top of                 Page                © 2000 State of California.
