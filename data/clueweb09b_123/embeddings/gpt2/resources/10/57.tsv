Do you know what is lurking out there on your credit report?       Your credit report contains tons of personal information that can be used in a variety of ways by many businesses, people and institutions. Because your credit report will impact many parts of your life, it is important that you know what a credit report contains, how it is used, and the best way for you to obtain and monitor your credit report.       Each of the three national credit bureaus is required by Federal Law to provide you with a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months.  Your credit report includes information on who you owe, how much you owe, where you live, and how timely you make payments to your creditors. A credit report, however, contains a lot more than just financial information; it shows whether you've been arrested, where you have lived, if anyone has a legal judgment against you, or if you have filed for bankruptcy in the past 10 years.        With the rise in identity theft, knowing how to monitor your credit report is more important than ever. Please use the information at Bills.com to learn how best to get your credit report, understand the information on it, and how to correct any inaccuracies on your credit report.

There are three major credit bureaus that offer credit reports:         Equifax        1-800-685-1111         www.equifax.com         Experian        1-888-397-3742         www.experian.com         Trans Union        1-800-916-8800         www.transunion.com        To get a hold of your credit report, contact one of these three bureaus. Each bureau interprets your credit information differently, so you might want to get a report from all three.                Can I get a Copy of My Credit Report at Any Time?              By law, you're entitled to one free credit report annually from the credit bureaus.  This can be accessed at:   www.annualcreditreport.com   - You can also request a free copy of your credit report if you were denied credit; however, you can only request a copy from the specific credit bureau that supplied the credit report to the creditor who denied you.         What Information do Credit Bureaus Collect about Me?              Credit bureaus collect your identification information, employment history, credit inquiries, and any additional public records and data.        Will Requesting a Credit Report Affect My Credit?              No. Requesting a credit report will NOT affect your credit. You have the right to look at your credit report without it affecting your credit or score. When you request your credit report it's called a ""consumer pull"" and has no affect on your credit. The only time when requesting a credit report can affect your credit is when you ask a possible creditor to inquire about your credit. This is because it implies that you're possibly opening a new line of credit.                                                                                                                                                                    Glossary of Credit Report Terms                         Accounts in Good Standing:  positive items on your credit report that should reflect favorably on your overall creditworthiness.        Credit History:  a personal record of past credit accounts paid. Credit history is commonly used to predict a person's likelihood of making payments on time.        Credit Score:  this score is determined by the credit reporting agencies (a.k.a. credit bureaus) by taking a number of factors into consideration including but not limited to payment history, amount owed, and length of time an account has been open. Exact scales for traditional credit scoring vary from bureau to bureau, but are around 350 - 900. Your traditional credit score may be based on factors from as far back as seven or eight years.        Verification:  the process of checking whether or not data in a credit report is accurate. Verification is initiated by consumers when they question information in their credit report. Credit reporting agencies will accept valid documentation from the consumer that will help with verification.

A credit rating is simply someone's assessment of how well you would be able to pay back money lent to you. Usually, that ""someone"" is a credit reporting agency; however, creditors themselves will also make their own assessment, which is usually based on the score you receive from the credit reporting agencies and is determined by requirements that vary a great deal from one creditor to the next.

clueweb09-en0005-98-00113	               What the 403(b) Is      The 403(b) is a tax deferred retirement plan available for certain employees of public schools, employees of certain tax-exempt organizations, and  certain ministers.  If uncertain of your eligibility, consult your employer.     The 403(b) has often been referred to as a Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA) or a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA). This is a misnomer and gives the false impression that a participant must invest in annuity products. This is not true. Way back in 1974 Congress granted participants the ability to contribute directly in mutual funds when they added paragraph 7 to the code creating the 403(b)(7) custodial account. Throughout this site the term 403(b) is intended to mean all of the following: 403(b), 403(b)(7), TDA, and TSA. Ultimately, the 403(b) plan is a defined contribution plan (often called a DC plan), where the participant makes contributions and investment decisions, as opposed to a pension or defined benefit plan (often called a DB plan), where the employer makes all, or a majority of contributions and all of the investment decisions.    Why the 403(b) is Important    The 403(b) can be an excellent way to save money for retirement whether as a supplement to a traditional pension plan or other retirement plan(s), or as a stand-alone plan.    How the 403(b) Works    Employees set aside money for retirement on a pre-tax basis through a salary reduction agreement with their employer. Contributions and earnings on investments grow tax deferred until the time of retirement, when withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.    What Tax Deferred Means    An employee in the 15 percent federal tax bracket would reduce their taxable obligation by 15 cents for each dollar contributed to a 403(b). In effect, a $1 contribution would only cost the participant 85 cents. Employees in higher tax brackets would reduce tax obligation by even more.    How Much Can Be Contributed    For 2009, employees can contribute $16,500 in regular contributions. The IRS refers to regular contributions as elective deferrals. A Participant age 50 or older at any time during the year can contribute an additional $5,500 for 2009. For those with employer matches or other employer contributions, limit is $49,000 for 2009, or 100% of compensation (whichever is less). The participant is still limited to the employee elective deferral limit ($16,500 for 2009). An employer can add up to another $32,500 for 2009.    15 Years of Service Provision    Employees with 15 years or more of service with an employer and an annual average contribution of less than $5,000 per year, are eligible to contribute an additional $3,000 per year up to a lifetime maximum catch-up of $15,000.    Note:  For participants eligible for both the Age 50 Catch-up and the 15 Years of Service provision, the IRS will apply contributions above the 2009 limit of $16,500 first to the 15 Years of Service provision. For example, if an employee eligible for both catch-ups contributed $20,000 during the year 2009, $16,500 would count toward the regular contribution limit for 2009; $3,000 would count toward the 15 Years of Service provision; and $500 would count toward the Age 50 Catch-up. If this was the first contribution this participant had made toward the 15 Years of Service provision, the amount they would be able to contribute to this catch-up in the future would be reduced from $15,000 (the lifetime maximum) to $12,000 ($15,000 less the $3,000 contributed in 2009).    Where the 403(b) Can Be Invested    403(b) money can be invested in a fixed annuity; and/or variable annuity; and/or a mutual fund.    Fixed Annuities    Fixed annuities operate much like certificates of deposit but are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC). Generally, investors are given two interest rates: the current rate and the guaranteed rate. The current rate is the return that the insurance company promises to pay for a set period of time, typically between one and five years. The guaranteed rate, usually lower, is the minimum rate that investors will receive after the current rate expires, regardless of market conditions.    Variable Annuities    A variable annuity offers a range of investment options — typically mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, or some combination of the three. These investments options are referred to as the subaccount. The value of the investment will vary depending on the performance of the investments in the subaccount. There is usually a death benefit that will pay a beneficiary the greater of the account value or a guaranteed minimum amount, such as total purchase payments. Variable annuities are securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    Mutual Funds(    A mutual fund is an investment that pools money from many participants and invests in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, or some combination of the three. The combined holdings of stocks, bonds, or other assets that the fund owns are known as its portfolio. Each investor in the fund owns shares, which represent a part of these holdings. There are two kinds of mutual funds: loaded mutual funds and no-load mutual funds. A load is a commission the investor must pay in order to purchase/sell that fund. All mutual funds have operating costs. Mutual funds are securities regulated by the SEC but are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC or any other government agency.

What factors impact my credit score? Doing the following typically has a positive impact on your credit score:      Paying your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections can have a significantly negative impact on your score.    If you have missed payments in the past, getting current and staying current on your payments.    Paying off debt rather than move it around.    Re-establishing your credit worthiness if you have had problems. Opening new accounts responsibly and paying them off on time may help in the long run.    Applying for and opening new credit accounts only as needed.    Keeping credit cards and managing them responsibly. In general, having credit cards and installment loans (and making timely payments) may help in the long run. Someone with no credit cards, for example, may be seen as a higher risk than someone who has demonstrated a history of managing credit cards responsibly.    If you are having trouble making ends meet, contacting your creditors or seeing a legitimate, reputable credit counselor.    Keeping balances low on credit cards and other lines of revolving credit.    Doing your rate shopping for a loan or credit line within a short period of time. FICO® scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and a search for many new credit lines in part by the length of time over which inquiries occur.      The following factors typically do not have a positive impact (or may even have a negative impact) on your credit score:     Opening a number of new credit cards that you do not need, just to increase your available credit. This approach could backfire and actually have a negative impact on your score.   Opening a lot of new accounts in a short period of time, especially if you have been managing credit for a short time. New accounts will lower your average account age. If you do not have a lot of other information in your credit file, this could have a larger effect on your score. Also, rapid account build-up can look risky if you are a new credit user.   What is a ""good"" credit score? FICO® scores can range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores usually fall within the 600s and 700s:     20% are above 780    20% are in the range of 745 - 780    20% are in the range of 690 - 745    20% are in the range of 620 - 690    20% are below 619    Since there is no universal score cutoff used by all lenders, it is hard to say what a good score is outside the context of a particular lending decision. For example, one lender may determine that a score of 750 may qualify you for a platinum credit card, whereas a score of 675 may indicate that you are a better match for a standard card. Why is my Equifax score different from my Experian and TransUnion credit scores? There are several reasons for variations in your credit score among the different credit reporting agencies and even among different credit grantors:     First, your credit score from each credit reporting agency is based on the information in your credit file at the credit reporting agency, and the credit history information each credit reporting agency has about you can differ. This can result in your score at the other credit reporting agencies being different from your Equifax score.    Second, there is a slightly different FICO credit scoring model at each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies due to the differences in credit history information they each have about you. Remember: your FICO score at a given credit reporting agency is only based on the credit data that credit reporting agency has about you.    Third, although the FICO® credit scoring model is the score used most often by lenders, each of the credit reporting agencies, including Equifax, has their own scoring models. These other models may evaluate your credit file differently from the FICO® model and, in some cases a higher score may mean more risk, not less risk as with FICO® scores.

In most cases, the payments you receive or that are made available to you under your 403(b) account are taxable in full as                         ordinary income. In                         general, the same tax rules apply to distributions from 403(b) plans that apply to distributions from other retirement plans.                         These rules are                         explained in Publication 575. Publication 575 also discusses the additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans.                         For more information                         concerning public safety employees, see Publication 575.                                                                       Distribution for active reservist.                                  The 10% penalty for early withdrawal will not apply to a qualified reservist distribution attributable to elective                         deferrals from a 403(b) plan.  A                          qualified reservist distribution  is a distribution that is made:                                                                                                                                                   To an individual who is a reservist or national guardsman and who was ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess                                     of 179 days or                                     for an indefinite period; and                                                                                                                                       During the period beginning on the date of the order or call to duty and ending at the close of the active duty period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Minimum Required Distributions                                                                                                                     You must receive all, or at least a certain minimum, of your interest accruing after 1986 in the 403(b) plan by April 1 of                            the calendar year                            following the later of the calendar year in which you become age 70½ or the calendar year in which you retire.                                                                                Check with your employer, plan administrator, or provider to find out whether this rule also applies to pre-1987 accruals.                            If not, a minimum amount                            of these accruals must begin to be distributed by the later of the end of the calendar year in which you reach age 75 or April                            1 of the calendar year                            following retirement, whichever is later. For each year thereafter, the minimum distribution must be made by the last day                            of the year. If you do not                            receive the required minimum distribution, you are subject to a nondeductible 50% excise tax on the difference between the                            required minimum                            distribution and the amount actually distributed.                                                                                For more information on minimum distribution requirements and the additional tax that applies if too little is distributed                            each year, see                            Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              No Special 10-Year Tax Option                                                                                                                     A distribution from a 403(b) plan does not qualify as a lump-sum distribution. This means you cannot use the special 10-year                            tax option to                            calculate the taxable portion of a 403(b) distribution. For more information, see Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Transfer of Interest in 403(b) Contract                                                                                                                                        90-24 transfer.                                  If you transfer all or part of your interest from a 403(b) account to another 403(b) account, the transfer is tax                         free. This is known as a 90-24                         transfer. However, this treatment applies only if the transferred interest is subject to the same or stricter distribution                         restrictions. This rule                         applies regardless of whether you are a current employee, a former employee, or a beneficiary of a former employee. After                         September 24, 2007, you may                         no longer make a 90-24 transfer without your employer's involvement.                                                                                    Transfers that do not satisfy this rule are plan distributions and are generally taxable as ordinary income.                                                                                                 Tax-free transfers for certain cash distributions.                                  A tax-free transfer may also apply to a cash distribution of your 403(b) account from an insurance company that is                         subject to a rehabilitation,                         conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding. To receive tax-free treatment, you must do all of the following.                                                                                                                                                   Withdraw all the cash to which you are entitled in full settlement of your contract rights or, if less, the maximum permitted                                     by the                                     state.                                                                                                                                      Reinvest the cash distribution in a single policy or contract issued by another insurance company or in a single custodial                                     account subject                                     to the same or stricter distribution restrictions as the original contract not later than 60 days after you receive the cash                                     distribution.                                                                                                                                      Assign all future distribution rights to the new contract or account for investment in that contract or account if you received                                     an amount                                     that is less than what you are entitled to because of state restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              In addition to the preceding requirements, you must provide the new insurer with a written statement containing all                         of the following information:                                                                                                                                                   The gross amount of cash distributed under the old contract.                                                                                                    The amount of cash reinvested in the new contract.                                                                                                    Your investment in the old contract on the date you receive your first cash distribution.                                                                                                                                                                            Also, you must attach the following items to your timely filed income tax return in the year you receive the first                         distribution of cash.                                                                                                                                                   A copy of the statement you gave the new insurer.

Direct trustee-to-trustee transfer.                                  If you make a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, from your governmental 403(b) account to a defined benefit governmental                         plan, it may not be                         includible in gross income.                                                                                    The transfer amount is not includible in gross income if it is made to:                                                                                                                                                   Purchase permissive service credits, or                                                                                                    Repay contributions and earnings that were previously refunded under a forfeiture of service credit under the plan, or under                                     another plan                                     maintained by a state or local government employer within the same state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           After-tax contributions.                                  For distributions beginning after December 31, 2006, after-tax contributions can be rolled over between a 403(b) plan                         and a defined benefit plan,                         IRA, or a defined contribution plan. If the rollover is to or from a 403(b) plan, it must occur through a direct trustee-to-trustee                         transfer.                                                                                                 Permissive service credit.                                  A  permissive service credit  is credit for a period of service recognized by a defined benefit governmental plan, only if you voluntarily                         contribute to the plan an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to the period                         of service and the amount                         contributed is in addition to the regular employee contribution, if any, under the plan.                                                                                    Permissive service credit may also include service credit for up to 5 years where there is no performance of service,                         or service credited to                         provide an increased benefit for service credit which a participant is receiving under the plan.                                                                                    Check with your plan administrator as to the type and extent of service that may be purchased by this transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Tax-Free Rollovers                                                                                                                                        You can generally roll over tax free all or any part of a distribution from a 403(b) plan to a traditional IRA or a non-Roth                         eligible retirement                         plan, except for any nonqualifying distributions, described below. You may also rollover any part of a distribution from a                         403(b) plan by converting                         it through a direct rollover, described below, to a Roth IRA. Conversion amounts are generally includible in your taxable                         income in the year of the                         distribution from your 403(b) account. See Publication 590 for more information about conversion into a Roth IRA.                                                                       Hardship exception to rollover rules.                                  The IRS may waive the 60-day rollover period if the failure to waive such requirement would be against equity or good                         conscience, including cases                         of casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable control of the individual.                                                                                    To obtain a hardship exception, you must apply to the IRS for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement. You apply                         for the waiver by following                         the general instructions used in requesting a letter ruling. These instructions are stated in Revenue Procedure 2007-4 found                         in Internal Revenue                         Bulletin 2007-1. You must also pay a user fee with the application. The user fee for a rollover that is less than $50,000                         is $500. For rollovers that                         are $50,000 or more, see                           Revenue Procedure 2007-8, 2007-1 I.R.B. 230.                                                                                    In determining whether to grant a waiver, the IRS will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including:                                                                                                                                                   Whether errors were made by the financial institution;                                                                                                    Whether you were unable to complete the rollover due to death, disability, hospitalization, incarceration, restrictions imposed                                     by a foreign                                     country, or postal error;                                                                                                                                      Whether you used the amount distributed (for example, in the case of payment by check, whether you cashed the check); and                                                                                                    How much time has passed since the date of distribution.                                                                                                                                                                            For additional information on rollovers, see Publication 590.                                                                                                                                                       Contributions from a designated Roth account can only be rolled over to another Roth account or a Roth IRA.                                                                       Rollovers to and from 403(b) plans.                                  You can generally roll over tax free all or any part of a distribution from an eligible retirement plan to a 403(b)                         plan. Beginning January 1,                         2008, distributions from tax-qualified retirement plans and tax-sheltered annuities can be converted by making a direct rollover                         into a Roth IRA                         subject to the restrictions that currently apply to rollovers from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Converted amounts are                         generally includible in                         your taxable income in the year of the distribution from your 403(b) account. See Publication 590 for more information on                         conversion into a Roth IRA.                         Additionally, you can generally roll over, tax free, all or any part of a distribution from a 403(b) plan to a non-Roth eligible                         retirement plan,                         except for any nonqualifying distributions, described below.                                                                                    If a distribution includes both pre-tax contributions and after-tax contributions, the portion of the distribution                         that is rolled over is treated                         as consisting first of pre-tax amounts (contributions and earnings that would be includible in income if no rollover occurred).                         This means that if you                         roll over an amount that is at least as much as the pre-tax portion of the distribution, you do not have to include any of                         the distribution in income.                                                                                    For more information on rollovers and eligible retirement plans, see Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                       If you roll over money or other property from a 403(b) plan to an eligible retirement plan, see Publication 575 for information                         about possible                         effects on later distributions from the eligible retirement plan.                                                                       Eligible retirement plans.                                  The following are considered eligible retirement plans.

(To determine if your plan is a qualified plan, ask your plan administrator.)                                                                                                    403(b) plans.

If the distribution is from a designated Roth account, then the only eligible retirement plan is another designated Roth account                         or a Roth IRA.                                                                                                 Nonqualifying distributions.                                  You cannot roll over tax free:                                                                                                                                                   Minimum distributions (generally required to begin at age 70½),                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments over your life or life expectancy,                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments over the joint lives or life expectancies of your beneficiary and you,                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments for a period of 10 years or more,                                                                                                     Hardship distributions, or                                                                                                    Corrective distributions of excess contributions or excess deferrals, and any income allocable to the excess, or excess annual                                     additions and                                     any allocable gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Rollover of nontaxable amounts.                                   You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such as your after-tax contributions) made to                         another eligible retirement                         plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct rollover to an eligible plan that separately                         accounts for the                         taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover or through a rollover to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.                                                                                    If you roll over only part of a distribution that includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts, the amount you roll                         over is treated as coming first                         from the taxable part of the distribution.                                                                                                 Direct rollovers of 403(b) plan distributions.                                  You have the option of having your 403(b) plan make the rollover directly to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA or new plan.                         Before you receive a                         distribution, your plan will give you information on this. It is generally to your advantage to choose this option because                         your plan will not withhold                         tax on the distribution if you choose it.                                                                                                 Distribution received by you.                                  If you receive a distribution that qualifies to be rolled over, you can roll over all or any part of the distribution.                         Generally, you will receive                         only 80% of the distribution because 20% must be withheld. If you roll over only the 80% you receive, you must pay tax on                         the 20% you did not roll                         over. You can replace the 20% that was withheld with other money within the 60-day period to make a 100% rollover.                                                                                                 Voluntary deductible contributions.                                  For tax years 1982 through 1986, employees could make deductible contributions to a 403(b) plan under the individual                         retirement arrangement (IRA)                         rules instead of deducting contributions to a traditional IRA.                                                                                    If you made voluntary deductible contributions to a 403(b) plan under these traditional IRA rules, the distribution                         of all or part of the                         accumulated deductible contributions may be rolled over assuming it otherwise qualifies as a distribution you can roll over.                         Accumulated deductible                         contributions are the deductible contributions plus income and gain allocable to the contributions, minus expenses and losses                         allocable to the                         contributions, and minus distributions from the contributions, income, or gain.                                                                                                 Excess employer contributions.                                  The portion of a distribution from a 403(b) plan transferred to a traditional IRA that was previously included in                         income as excess employer                         contributions (discussed earlier) is not an eligible rollover distribution.                                                                                    Its transfer does not affect the rollover treatment of the eligible portion of the transferred amounts. However, the                         ineligible portion is subject                         to the traditional IRA contribution limits and may create an excess IRA contribution subject to a 6% excise tax (see chapter                         1 of Publication 590).                                                                                                 Qualified domestic relations order.                                  You may be able to roll over tax free all or any part of an eligible rollover distribution from a 403(b) plan that                         you receive under a qualified                         domestic relations order (QDRO). If you receive the interest in the 403(b) plan as an employee's spouse or former spouse under                         a QDRO, all of the                         rollover rules apply to you as if you were the employee. You can roll over your interest in the plan to a traditional IRA                         or another 403(b) plan. For                         more information on the treatment of an interest received under a QDRO, see Publication 575.                                                                                                 Spouses of deceased employees.                                  If you are the spouse of a deceased employee, you can roll over the qualifying distribution attributable to the employee.                         You can make the rollover                         to any eligible retirement plan.                                                                                    If after you roll over money and other property from a 403(b) plan to an eligible retirement plan, you take a distribution                         from that plan, you will                         not be eligible to receive the capital gain treatment or the special averaging treatment for the distribution.                                                                                                 Second rollover.                                  If you roll over a qualifying distribution to a traditional IRA, you can, if certain conditions are satisfied, later                         roll the distribution into                         another 403(b) plan. For more information, see  IRA as a holding account (conduit IRA) for rollovers to other eligible plans  in Publication                         590.                                                                                                 Nonspouse beneficiary.                                  A nonspouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover of a distribution from a 403(b) plan of a deceased participant                         if the rollover is a direct                         transfer to an inherited IRA established to receive the distribution. If the rollover is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer                         to an IRA established to                         receive the distribution:                                                                                                                                                   The transfer will be treated as an eligible rollover distribution.                                                                                                    The IRA will be considered an inherited account.                                                                                                    The required minimum distribution rules that apply in instances where the participant dies before the entire interest is distributed                                     will                                     apply to the transferred IRA.                                                                                                                                                                                                               For more information on IRAs, see Publication 590.

Are you curious about your annual credit report? Under the law, you are entitled to receive a  free credit report  from the three major credit bureaus in the United States. These reports tell give you an idea of your chances of getting a loan.    The free annual credit report will enable you to examine whether there is any wrong information provided there. Take note that many credit reports contain inaccurate data that can seriously damage your financial standing since lenders study your credit report when determining your capability to pay back the debt.    Even though there are great opportunities for people with bad credit, it is still a lot better for you to have a good credit rating. You can make your life a little bit easier by reviewing your  free annual credit report  and correcting any wrong information that damages your credit rating.    It is not impossible to achieve this.  Here are three things you need to remember:    1.  Negative marks on your credit report are not going to last forever. Be on your best financial behavior, and you will soon see that your credit rating is getting better. A year or two of prompt payments on your credit card and mortgage can do wonders.     2.  Some  bad credit lenders  use professional underwriters to assess your capability to make payments rather than your history. Some even go through the effort of digging into your previous debt to find out if you fell behind on payments because of divorce or other circumstances.    3.   Loans  do not last forever. The drawback of a  bad credit loan  is that you pay more than someone with good rating does. Once you make payments for several years, you are able to establish a new credit history and return to the mainstream market.    One of your most important financial tools is your credit report. Make sure to take advantage of the opportunity to read your report. This is one of the first steps to gaining control of your finances.                                                                Your Free Credit Report May Reveal Surprises                                      You might be thinking that your credit is  impeccable, you have never been denied a loan before and you have never been late on your bills.

Your free credit report is recognized as your license to  apply for a loan . What is typically referred to as a credit report is more accurately termed a consumer report by the federal government. This is because credit is only one aspect of the report. A typical consumer report contains personal data, employment history, detailed account information including a monthly transaction history, information reported by landlords, utility and insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, lawyers, and other agencies.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1).

Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that the creditor cannot verify.                    I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.

Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                              Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.  It feels like a slow process, but hang in there, because it DOES work.  This tedious process can be made much simpler with the automated help of Credit Doctor™ Software  www.creditdoctorsoftware.com .   Credit Doctor™ stores your user information to merge into its database of letters, saving you many long hours of letter writing.                                                                            A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT                    The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                      2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                    3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                    4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                    With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                    • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor                     5). Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                    Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                              Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.  It feels like a slow process, but hang in there, because it DOES work.  This tedious process can be made much simpler with the automated help of Credit Doctor™ Software  www.creditdoctorsoftware.com .   Credit Doctor™ stores your user information to merge into its database of letters, saving you many long hours of letter writing.                                                                            A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT                    The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

You can have negative misinformation wiped away from your reports, you can negotiate with creditors to remove negative postings and lower your payments, and you can raise your credit score higher so you can get the loan that you want at the low interest rated you deserve.  All it takes is perseverance, a positive attitude and knowledge.  You're reading this book, and that's good positive start.                     Just remember:  If every single day you do at least one (1) thing to better your credit, you will generate momentum to bring you closer to your goal.                    I hope you enjoy this booklet and find it useful!  Good luck to you on your journey to better credit.                    ─ Credit Doctor                                                                                                  TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CREDIT REPAIR                                                             Credit Repair Companies are very expensive.  They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                      2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                    3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                    4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                    With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                    • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor                     5). Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that the creditor cannot verify.                    I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                    Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                                                                                                                   Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                     You do not need a Software Program applications to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a financial nightmare.                                                                                    YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                 These credit reports are used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers make check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                      CREDIT SCORING                                ""Scoring"" of is a system Lenders use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you fill out a loan application, bank or lender will often request your credit report (or score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull credit reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                 The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOsc ores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                 Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                      HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 The three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your credit reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                  You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Credit Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free credit reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual credit report Request Form and mail it to: Annual credit report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies every 12 months.                 You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer credit reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                 There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free credit report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your credit report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer credit reporting company. You're also entitled to one free credit report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your credit report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer credit reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your credit report within a 12-month period.                 To buy copies of your credit reports, contact:                 Equifax                800-685-1111                                Experian                888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                Trans Union                800-916-8800                                 Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                   REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                   Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your file lowers your score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                  Since your credit reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your credit reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your credit report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                  Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your credit reports, contact that bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                 Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                                      HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 The bulk of the credit report will be filled with information showing the following:                 1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                   2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                 3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                 4). Account Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the credit report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                 With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                 • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company                  5). Inquiries that display                 All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                  6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                 These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                 7). Consumer Statements                 If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your credit report.                                                      SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT                                Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                   Make sure your personal Information is correct                                     Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                   Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                                     Make sure your balances are listed correctly                                                                                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                                                          STATING YOUR DISPUTE                 Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                  After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your credit report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                 Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                 If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your credit report.                 When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the bureau send corrected copies of your credit report to all creditors who have received the incorrect credit reports for the past six months. Note: The bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                   SAMPLE CREDIT REPORT DISPUTE LETTER                 Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

See the attached copy of my credit report, the errors have been highlighted.                 Here as follows are items in error:                 Explanation                 By the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I demand that these items be investigated and removed from my credit report.                 It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that cannot be verified.                 I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated credit report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                 Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                                 _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                  Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                                      DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                 Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                 If you've ignored (or never received) a lender's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                  If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                 Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                 *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                                      SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                      Correct all inaccuracies in your Credit Reports.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your credit report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your credit report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                                         Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the Lender will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                                                         If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                                        If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                         Pay all cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a card with a $10,000 line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Line without checking your FICO score or your credit report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                                         Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the credit cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                                          Avoid applying for new credit.                                         Each time you apply, your credit report gets checked. New cards will not help your score and an account less than one year old may hurt your score.  Use your cards as little as possible until the next scoring.                                                          Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                                        The credit scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typicalcredit card, you might want to set up a ""secured card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your credit score even higher.                                                   Throughout this process, always remember:                 I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

Under the new Vantage Score model used by all three bureaus, your credit score (FICO score), is a number between 501 (worst) and 990 (best) that is used to determine a consumer’s credit worthiness and potential risk to the lender. It is determined by one’s credit history. NOTICE: Not all institutions that check credit worthiness use the VantageScore. Some still rely on the traditional credit score systems of each individual Credit Bureau.   Get Your Report for $39.95 in 4 Minutes.

Equifax, Experian and TransUnion sometimes have access to different information, so your credit reports at each will reflect that different information. Your credit score also almost certainly will be different. Even through every agency uses the same software to compute credit scores – Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) – they use a different formula.

Sometimes your information can be sold to potential creditors so that they can offer you pre-approved credit offers. If you want off the list you should call 1-888-5-OPTOUT.
