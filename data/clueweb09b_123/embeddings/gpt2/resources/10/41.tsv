Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

The  archipelago  is located some 1,750 km east of  Australia , north-east of  New Caledonia , west of  Fiji  and south of the  Solomon Islands .

The first  European  explorer to reach the islands was  Spaniard   Pedro Fernndez de Quiros  in  1606 . After  James Cook  also visited the islands in the late  18th century , Europeans started to settle on the islands.   In  1906 , the  French  and  British  agreed to a  Anglo-French Condominium  on the  New Hebrides , as the islands were then known. In the  1960s , the Vanuatuan people started to press for self-government and later independence, which was finally granted by both European nations on  July 30 ,  1980 .   During the  1990s , Vanuatu experienced some political instability, which eventually resulted in a more de-centralised government.     Politics     Main article:  Politics of Vanuatu    The parliament of Vanuatu is unicameral, and has 52 members. These are elected every four years by popular vote. The leader of the main party in the parliament is usually appointed prime minister, and heads the government. The chief of state, the president, is chosen by the parliament and regional councils every five years.     Provinces     Main article:  Provinces of Vanuatu    Vanuatu has six provinces:         Malampa     Penama      Sanma      Shefa     Tafea     Torba        Geography     Main article:  Geography of Vanuatu        Vanuatu consists of 83 islands, of which two - Matthew and Hunter - are also claimed by the French oversea department of  New Caledonia . Most of the islands are mountainous and of volcanic origin, and have a  tropical  or sub-tropical  climate .   The nation's largest towns are the capital  Port Vila , which is situated on  Efate , and  Luganville , on  Espiritu Santo .     Economy     Main article:  Economy of Vanuatu    The economy is based primarily on subsistence or small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for 65% of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about 50,000 visitors in 1997, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. A severe earthquake in November 1999 followed by a tsunami, caused extensive damage to the northern island of Pentecote and left thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port-Vila, and surrounding areas, and also was followed by a tsunami. GDP growth rose less than 3% on average in the 1990s. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002 the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of foreign aid.   Vanuatu is a tax haven that doesn't release account information to other governments and law enforcement agencies. In Vanuatu there is no income tax, no withholding tax, no capital gains tax, no death duties and no exchange controls.     Demographics     Main article:  Demographics of Vanuatu    Most of the inhabitants of Vanuatu (95%) are native  Melanesian , or  Ni-Vanuatu , with the remainder made up of Europeans, Asians and other Pacific islanders. There are three official languages in Vanuatu,  English ,  French  and  Bislama , which is a  pidgin  of English. In addition over a hundred local languages are spoken on the islands.    Christianity  is the predominant religion in Vanuatu, although there are a lot of denominations. The  Presbyterian Church , adhered by about one third of the population, is the largest of them.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives. In its later years, the Civil Rights Movement took a sharp turn to the  radical left  in many cases.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence. SMH     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues. Neka Waz Here     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.       [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Feminist Movement in the United States (19631982)  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issues such as changing social attitudes and economic, reproductive, and educational equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. For the new feminist movement, which spanned from 1963 to 1982, explored economic equality, political power at all levels, professional equality, reproductive freedoms, sexuality, issues with the family, educational equality, sexuality, and many other issues.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

Contrast with  economic, social and cultural rights . Civil and political rights are included in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and elaborated upon in the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .   The theory of  three generations of human rights  considers these to be first-generation rights, and most (but not all) of them are considered to be  negative rights .   Examples of civil rights and liberties include the right to get redress if injured by another, the right to privacy, the right of peaceful protest, the right to a fair investigation and trial if suspected of a crime, and more generally-based  constitutional rights  such as the  right to vote , the right to personal freedom, the right to  freedom of movement  and the right of equal protection.   Laws guaranteeing civil rights may be written down, derived from  custom , or implied. In the  United States  and most continental  European  countries, civil rights laws are most often written. As civilizations emerged and their laws were formalized through written  constitutions , some of the more important civil rights were granted to  citizens . When those grants were later found inadequate,  civil rights movements  emerged as the vehicle for claiming more  equal protection  for all citizens and advocating new laws to restrict the effects of discrimination.   Implied rights are rights that a court may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom, on the theory that a written or customary right must necessarily include the implied right. One famous (and controversial) example of a right implied from the U.S. Constitution is the ""right to  privacy "", which the  U.S. Supreme Court  found to exist in the 1965 case of  Griswold v. Connecticut . In the 1973 case of  Roe v. Wade , the court found that state legislation prohibiting or limiting abortion violated this right to privacy. As a rule, state governments can expand civil rights beyond the U.S. Constitution, but they cannot diminish Constitutional rights.

In the United States, the  Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  protects citizens against many forms of State discrimination, with its  due process  and  equal protection  requirements. Civil rights can also refer to protection against private actors or entities. The  U.S. Congress  subsequently addressed the issue through the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 1 ]  Sec. 201. which states: (a) All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or  national origin  or sex. This legislation and the  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  are constitutional under the  Commerce Clause , as the Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment only applies to the State. States generally have the power to enact similar legislation, provided that they meet the federal government under the doctrine of  police powers .   The terms  civil rights  and  civil liberties  are often used interchangeably in the United States.  Thomas Jefferson  wrote, ""a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their  chief magistrate ."" [ 2 ]   The  United States Constitution  recognizes different civil rights than do most other national constitutions. Two examples of civil rights found in the US but rarely (if ever) elsewhere are the  right to bear arms  ( Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ) and the right to a  jury trial  ( Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution ). Few nations, not even including a world organization body such as the  United Nations , have recognized either of these civil rights. Many nations recognize an individual's civil right to not be executed for murdering another [ citation needed ] , a civil right not recognized within the US.

Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with about 50,000 visitors in 2004, are other mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main markets and between constituent islands. GDP growth rose less than 3% on average in the 1990s. In response to foreign concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center. In mid-2002 the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.

It was accompanied by much  civil unrest  and popular rebellion. The process was long and tenuous in many countries, and most of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives. In its later years, the Civil Rights Movement took a sharp turn to the  radical left  in many cases.

Northern Ireland is a European country which has witnessed violence over many decades mainly because of sectarian tensions between the Catholic and Protestant community.             Bloody Sunday (1972)   memorial   mural       The Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland can be traced to women in Dungannon who began to fight for better housing for the members of the Catholic community. This domestic issue would not have led to a fight for Civil Rights if the policies of Northern Ireland did not make being a registered householder the qualification for the local government franchise. Thus these women were not only challenging what they saw as unfair housing policies, they were also taking the first steps toward fighting for Civil Rights for their community. Using various means to defend and improve the conditions for their communities, these women were in fact preparing a large part of the Catholic population to move beyond local and domestic issue and to embrace the larger purpose of the Civil Rights battle. This substantial contribution made by women is often erased from the general history of Northern Ireland primarily because this country still has a Protestant majority and a conservative culture who often overlook the role of women in the political sphere.  [ 1 ] .   On a more broad based and organized front, in January 1964, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ) was launched officially in Belfast. This organization took over the woman's struggle over better housing and committed itself to end the discrimination in employment. The CSJ promised the Catholic community that their cries would be heard. They challenged the government, promising that they would take their case to the Commission for Human Rights in Strasbourg and to the United Nations [ 2 ] .   Having started with basic domestic issues, the Civil Rights struggle in Northern Ireland escalated to a full scale movement who found its embodiment in the  Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association . NICRA campaigned in the late sixties and early seventies, consciously modeled itself on the  civil rights movement in the United States . Empowered by what African-Americans were doing, the movement took on marches and protest to demand better conditions for the minority of Catholics who lived in the Protestant state. Republican leader  Gerry Adams  explained that Catholics -courtesy of television- saw that it was possible for them to have their demands heard. He wrote that ""we were able to see an example of the fact that you didn't just have to take it, you could fight back"" [ 3 ] .   NICRA originally had five main demands:     one man, one vote   an end to discrimination in housing   an end to discrimination in local government   an end to the  gerrymandering  of district boundaries, which limited the effect of Catholic voting   the disbandment of the B-Specials, an entirely  Protestant  Police reserve, perceived as sectarian.     All of these specific demands were aimed at an ultimate goal that had been the one of women at the very beginning :the end to discrimination towards the Catholics.   Civil rights activists all around Northern Ireland soon launched a campaign of  civil disobedience . There was obviously widespread opposition from Protestant extremists (or Loyalists), who were aided by the  Royal Ulster Constabulary  (RUC), Northern Ireland's Police Force. At this point, the RUC was over 90% Protestant in its make-up. Violence escalated, resulting in the rise of the  Provisional Irish Republican Army  (IRA) from the Catholic community, a reminiscent group from the War of Independence and the Civil War that occurred in the 1920s - this group launched a campaign of violence to end British government presence in Northern Ireland. The  British government  responded with a policy of  internment  without trial of suspected IRA members. For more than three hundred people, the internment lasted several years. The huge majority of those interned by the British forces were Catholic. Protestant Loyalist  paramilitaries  had begun murdering dozens of Catholics, but were largely ignored by the British forces. In 1978, in a case brought by the government of the  Republic of Ireland  against the government of the  United Kingdom , the  European Court of Human Rights  ruled that the  interrogation  techniques approved for use by the British army on internees in 1971 amounted to ""inhuman and degrading"" treatment.   Although it is common knowledge that for a time the aims of the Republicans - and their military division, the IRA - and those of NICRA converged, the two bodies never merged. The IRA told the Republicans to join in the Civil Rights movement but it never controlled NICRA has Unionists often portrayed. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association fought for the end of discrimination toward Catholics and it was happy to do so within the British state  [ 4 ] .   One of the most important event in the era of Civil Rights in Northern Ireland took place in Derry, it was an event that changed the peaceful movement who used civil disobedience into an armed conflict. The  Battle of the Bogside  started on 12 August when an Apprentice Boys parade - a Protestant order - passed through Waterloo Place, where a large crowd was gathered at the mouth of William Street, on the edge of the Bogside. Different account described the first outbreak of violence either as an attack by youths from the Bogside on the RUC or as an outbreak of fighting between Protestants ans Catholics. In either way, the violence escalated in the neighborhood called the Bogside, where barricades were erected. Proclaiming this distrinct to be the  Free Derry , Bogsiders carry on fights with the RUC for days using stones and petrol bombs. The governement finally withdraw the RUC and instead sent the army to disbend the crowds of Catholics who were barricated in the Bogside  [ 5 ] .   Bloody Sunday  in  Derry  is seen as a turning point in the Civil Rights movement. On this day,the catholics were trying a peaceful way of resolving the problem. But they were ignored and fights broke out.Fourteen Catholic Civil rights marchers protesting against  internment  were shot dead by the British army and many were left wounded on the streets.   One of the leaders of  NICRA  was future  Nobel Peace Prize  winner  John Hume , another,  Austin Currie , a candidate for  President of Ireland  in 1990. Hume's co-Nobel Laureate,  David Trimble , was leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party  in the 1990s and 2000s, and had campaigned against sharing power with Catholics in the 1970s.   The peace process has made significant gains in recent years. Through open dialogue from all parties, a lasting ceasefire from all paramilitary groups seems to be lasting. A relatively strong economy and more opportunities for all citizens has improved Northern Ireland's standard of living. Civil rights issues have become far less of a concern for many Catholics in Northern Ireland over the past twenty years as laws and policies protecting their rights and forms of affirmative action have been implemented for all government offices and many private businesses. Tensions still exist in some corners of the province, but the vast majority of citizens are no longer affected by the violence that once paralyzed the province.     [ edit ]   Movements of Independence in Africa       Main article:  African independence movements       A wave of independence movements in  Africa  crested in the 1960s. This included the  Angolan War of Independence , the  Guinea-Bissauan Revolution , the war of liberation in  Mozambique  and the struggle against  apartheid  in  South Africa . This wave of struggles re-energised  pan-Africanism , and led to the founding of the  Organization of African Unity  (OAU) in 1963 1     [ edit ]   Canada's October Crisis       Main article:  October Crisis       Pierre Elliott Trudeau , himself a French Canadian, came to power in 1968. Quebec also produced a more radical nationalist group, the  Front de Libration du Qubec , who since 1963 had been using  terrorism  in an attempt to make Quebec a sovereign nation. In October 1970, in response to the arrest of some of its members earlier in the year, the FLQ kidnapped  James Cross  and  Pierre Laporte , later killing Laporte. Trudeau invoked the  War Measures Act , declaring  martial law  in  Quebec , and by the end of the year the kidnappers had all been arrested.     [ edit ]   Trudeau and the 1970s   Trudeau  was a somewhat unconventional  Prime Minister ; he was more of a celebrity than previous leaders, and in the 1960s had been the centre of "" Trudeaumania "". He also did not unquestioningly support the United States, especially over the  Vietnam War  and relations with the  People's Republic of China  and  Cuba ;  Richard Nixon  particularly disliked him.   Domestically Trudeau had to with the aftermath of the October Crisis. The  separatist movement  was not aided by the violent  Front de libration du Qubec  (FLQ), yet it still existed in a less radical form under Premier  Ren Lvesque  (1976-1985). Lvesque came to power as leader of the  Parti Qubcois , which wanted to make Quebec at least an autonomous society in Canada and at best an independent nation. A step towards this was taken in 1977 with the adoption of  Bill 101 , making French the only official language in the province.     [ edit ]   Civil Rights Movement in the United States       Main article:  African-American Civil Rights Movement (19551968)     See also:  The Sixties ,  New Left ,  New Communist Movement , and  African-American Civil Rights Movement (18961954)     In a relatively stable political system, after a status had been reached in which every citizen has the same rights by law, practical issues of discrimination remain. Even if every person is treated equally by the state, there may not be  equality  due to  discrimination  within society, such as in the workplace, which may hinder civil liberties in everyday life. During the second half of the 20th century,  Western societies  introduced  legislation  that tried to remove discrimination on the basis of race, gender or disability.   The Civil Rights Movement in the  United States  refers in part to a set of noted events and  reform movements  in that country aimed at abolishing public and private acts of  racial discrimination  and  racism  against  African Americans  between 1954 to 1968, particularly in the  southern United States . It is sometimes referred to as the  Second Reconstruction era .   Later, groups like the  Black Panther Party , the  Young Lords , the  Weathermen  and the  Brown Berets  turned to more harsh tactics to make a  revolution  that would establish, in particular,  self-determination  for U.S.  minorities   bids that ultimately failed due in part to a coordinated effort by the  United States Government 's  COINTELPRO  efforts to subvert such groups and their activities.     [ edit ]   Ethnicity Equity Issues     [ edit ]   Integrationism     See also:  Racial integration  and  Jim Crow laws     In the last decade of the nineteenth century in the  United States ,  racially discriminatory   laws  and racial  violence  aimed at African Americans began to mushroom. This period is sometimes referred to as the  nadir of American race relations . Elected, appointed, or hired government authorities began to require or permit discrimination, specifically in the states of  Texas ,  Louisiana ,  Mississippi ,  Alabama ,  Georgia ,  Florida ,  South Carolina ,  North Carolina ,  Virginia ,  Arkansas ,  Tennessee ,  Oklahoma , and  Kansas . There were four required or permitted acts of discrimination against African Americans. They included  racial segregation   upheld by the  United States Supreme Court  decision in  Plessy v. Ferguson  in 1896 - which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the  local level of government , voter suppression or  disfranchisement  in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and  mass racial violence  aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities. Although racial discrimination was present nationwide, the combination of law, public and private acts of discrimination, marginal economic opportunity, and violence directed toward African Americans in the southern states became known as  Jim Crow .           March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom       Noted  strategies  employed prior to the Civil Rights Movement of 1955 to 1968 to abolish discrimination against African Americans initially included  litigation  and  lobbying  attempts by familiar organizations such as the  NAACP . These efforts were the distinction of the  American Civil Rights Movement from 1896 to 1954 . However, by 1955, private citizens became frustrated by gradual approaches to implement  desegregation  by federal and state governments and the ""massive resistance"" by proponents of  racial segregation  and  voter suppression . In defiance, these citizens adopted a combined strategy of  direct action  with  nonviolent resistance  known as  civil disobedience . The acts of civil disobedience produced crisis situations between practitioners and government authorities. The authorities of federal, state, and local governments often had to act with an immediate response to end the crisis situations  sometimes in the practitioners favor. Some of the different forms of civil disobedience employed include  boycotts  as successfully practiced by the  Montgomery Bus Boycott  (1955-1956) in Alabama - which gave the movement one of its more famous icon in Rosa Parks-, "" sit-ins "" as demonstrated by the influential  Greensboro sit-in  (1960) in North Carolina, and  marches  as exhibited by the  Selma to Montgomery marches  (1965) in Alabama.   The most illustrious marches is still probably the  March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom . It is best remembered for the glorious speech  Martin Luther King Jr  gave, in which the ""I have a dream"" part turned into a national text and eclipsed the troubles the organisers had to bring to march forward. It had been a fairly complicated affair to bring about various leaders of civil rights, religious and labor groups, as the name of the march tells us, many compromises had to be done to united people fighting in so many different causes. The ""March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom"" emphasized the combined purposes of the march and the goals that each of the leaders aimed at. These leaders - informally named the Big Six - were  A. Philip Randolph ,  Roy Wilkins ,  Martin Luther King ,  Whitney Young , James Farmer  and  John Lewis . Althought they came from different political horizons, these leaders, once a compromise had been made, were intent on the peaceful success of the march who even had its own marshall, ensuring that the event would be peaceful and respectful of the law [ 6 ] . The success of the march is still being debated but one aspect has been raised in the last few years, it is the misrepresentation of women. A lot of feminine civil rights groups had participated in the organisation of the march but when it came to actual activity, women were denied the right to speak and were relegated to figurative roles in the back of the stage. As some female participants have noticed, the March can be remembered for the ""I Have a Dream"" speech but for most female activists it was a new awakening, forcing black women to not only fight for Civil Rights but also engaged in the Feminist movement [ 7 ] .   Noted achievements of the Civil Rights Movement in this area include the judicial victory in the  Brown v. Board of Education  case that nullified the legal article of "" separate but equal "" and made segregation legally impermissible, passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 [ 8 ]  that banned discrimination in employment practices and public accommodations, passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965  that restored voting rights, and passage of the  Civil Rights Act of 1968  that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.     [ edit ]   Black Power       Main article:  Black Power     See also:  Black Panther Party ,  Black nationalism , and  pan-Africanism     By 1965 the emergence of the  Black Power  movement (1966-1975) began gradually to eclipse the original "" integrated power "" aims of the Civil Rights Movement that had been espoused by  Martin Luther King Jr.  Advocates of Black Power argued for black  self-determination , and to assert that the  assimilation  inherent in integration robs  Africans  of their common heritage and dignity; e.g., the theorist and activist  Omali Yeshitela  argues that Africans have historically fought to protect their lands, cultures and freedoms from European  colonialists , and that any integration into the society which has stolen another people and their wealth is actually an act of  treason .   Today, most Black Power advocates have not changed their self-sufficiency argument.  Racism  still exists worldwide and it is generally accepted that blacks in the United States, on the whole, did not assimilate into U.S. ""mainstream"" culture either by King's integration measures or by the self-sufficiency measures of Black Power  rather, blacks arguably became evermore oppressed, this time partially by ""their own"" people in a new black  stratum  of the  middle class  and the  ruling class . Black Power's advocates generally argue that the reason for this  stalemate  and further oppression of the vast majority of U.S. blacks is because Black Power's objectives have not had the opportunity to be fully carried through.   One of the most public manifestation of the Black Power movement took place in the 1968 Olympics when two African-American stood on the podium doing a Black Power salute. This act is still remembered today as the  1968 Olympics Black Power salute .     [ edit ]   Chicano Movement       Main article:  Chicano Movement     See also:  Chicano nationalism  and  Brown Berets     The Chicano Movement, also known as the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, Mexican-American Civil Rights Movement and  El Movimiento , was the part of the  American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)  that sought political empowerment and social inclusion for Mexican-Americans around a generally nationalist argument. The Chicano movement blossomed in the [1960s] and was active through the late [1970s] in various regions of the U.S. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.   The early heroes of the movement Rodolfo Gonzales  in  Denver, Colorado  and  Reies Tijerina  in New Mexicoadopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that had obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a nationalism that identified the failure of the United States government to live up to its promises in the  Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo . In that account, Mexican-Americans were a conquered people who simply needed to reclaim their birthright and cultural heritage as part of a new nation, which later became known as  Aztln .   That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of undocumented immigrants in the United States in the 1960snot surprisingly, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire. It was a decade later when activists, such as Bert Corona in California, embraced the rights of undocumented workers and helped broaden the movement to include their issues.   When the movement dealt with practical problems in the 1960s, most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and  East Los Angeles  in 1968 and the  Chicano Moratorium  in Los Angeles in 1970.   The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed MEChA,  Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztln , which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized ethno-nationalist agenda.     [ edit ]   American Indian Movement       Main article:  American Indian Movement       At a time when peaceful  sit-ins  were a common protest tactic,  American Indian Movement  (AIM) takeovers in their early days were noticeably forceful. Some appeared to be spontaneous outcomes of protest gatherings; sometimes they included armed seizure of public facilities.   The  Alcatraz Island  occupation of 1969, although commonly associated with AIM, pre-dated the organization but was a catalyst for its formation.   In 1970 AIM occupied abandoned property at the  Naval Air Station  near  Minneapolis, Minnesota . In July 1971, AIM assisted a takeover of the Winter Dam, Lac Courte Oreilles,  Wisconsin . When activists took over the  Bureau of Indian Affairs  Headquarters in  Washington D.C.  in November 1972, they sacked the building, and 24 people were arrested. Activists occupied the  Custer County  Courthouse in 1973, though police routed the occupation after a riot took place.   In 1973 activists and military forces confronted each other in the  Wounded Knee Incident . The standoff lasted 71 days, and two men died in the violence.     [ edit ]   Gender Equity Issues       Main articles:  Second-wave feminism  and  Women's Liberation       If the period associated with  First-wave feminism  focused upon absolute rights such as  suffrage  (which led to women attaining the right to vote in the early part of the 20th century), the period of the  second-wave feminism  was concerned with the issue of economic equality (including the ability to have careers in addition to motherhood, or the right to choose not to have children) between the genders and addressed the rights of female minorities. One phenomenon included the recognition of  lesbian  women within the movement, due to the simultaneous rise of the  gay rights  movement, and the deliberate activism of lesbian feminist groups, such as the  Lavender Menace .   The developments led to explicit  lesbian feminist  campaigns and groups, and some feminists went further to argue that heterosexual sexual relationships automatically subordinated women, and that the only true independence could come in lesbian relationships ("" lesbian separatism ""). The second wave is sometimes linked with  radical feminist  theory. One interesting and underdocumented aspect of the second-wave was the rise of women's cooperative living communities. An example of one such intentional community was the Chatanika River Women's Colony.     [ edit ]   LGBT rights and Gay Liberation       Main articles:  Gay Liberation  and  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement               Gay Liberation Front  Poster,  New York City , 1970       Since the mid 19th century in  Germany , social reformers have used the language of civil rights to argue against the oppression of same-sex sexuality, same-sex emotional intimacy, and  gender variance . Largely, but not exclusively, these  LGBT movements  have charactered gender variant and homosexually-oriented people as a  minority group  or groups; this was the approach taken by the  homophile movement  of the 1940s, 50s and early 60s. With the rise of  secularism  in the West, an increasing sexual openness,  Women's Liberation , the 1960s  counterculture , and a range of  new social movements , the homophile movement underwent a rapid growth and transformation, with a focus on building community and unapologetic activism. This new phase came to be known as  Gay Liberation .   The words ""Gay Liberation"" echoed ""Women's Liberation""; the  Gay Liberation Front  consciously took its name from the National Liberation Fronts of  Vietnam  and  Algeria ; and the slogan ""Gay Power"", as a defiant answer to the rights-oriented homophile movement, was inspired by  Black Power  and  Chicano  Power. The GLF's statement of purpose explained:     ""We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.""     GLF statement of purpose     GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote,     ""We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex-role structure and nuclear family structure.""     ""Gay is Good"", Martha Shelley, 1970     Gay Liberationists aimed as transforming fundamental concepts and institutions of society, such as  gender  and the  family . In order to achieve such  liberation ,  consciousness raising  and  direct action  were employed. Specifically, the word 'gay' was preferred to previous designations such as homosexual or  homophile ; some saw 'gay' as a rejection of the  false dichotomy  heterosexual/homosexual. Lesbians and gays were urged to "" come out "" and publicly reveal their sexuality to family, friends and colleagues as a form of activism, and to counter shame with  gay pride . ""Gay Lib"" groups were formed in the Western world, in Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the UK, US, Italy and elsewhere. The lesbian group  Lavender Menace  was also formed in the U.S in response to both the male domination of other Gay Lib groups and the anti-lesbian sentiment in the Women's Movement. Lesbianism was advocated as a feminist choice for women, and the first currents of  lesbian separatism  began to emerge.   By the late 1970s, the radicalism of Gay Liberation was eclipsed by a return to a more formal movement that became known as the  Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement .     [ edit ]   German Student Movement       Main article:  German student movement     See also:  Red Army Faction  and  German Autumn             Ulrike Meinhof  while still a journalist       The Civil Rights Movement in  Germany  was a  left-wing  backlash against the post- Nazi Party  era of the country, which still contained many of the conservative policies of both that era and of the pre- World War I   Kaiser   monarchy . The movement took place mostly among disillusioned students and was largely a  protest  movement analogous to others around the globe during the late 1960s . It was largely a reaction against the perceived authoritarianism and hypocrisy of the German government and other Western governments, and the poor living conditions of students. A wave of protests - some violent - swept Germany, further fueled by over-reaction by the police and encouraged by other near-simultaneous protest movements, across the world. Following more than a century of  conservatism  among German students, the German student movement also marked a significant major shift to the  left-wing  and  radicalisation  of student  politics .     [ edit ]   France 1968       Main article:  May 1968       A  general strike  broke out across  France  in May 1968. It quickly began to reach near- revolutionary  proportions before being discouraged by the  French Communist Party , and finally suppressed by the government, which accused the communists of plotting against the Republic. Some philosophers and historians have argued that the rebellion was the single most important revolutionary event of the 20th century because it wasn't participated in by a lone  demographic , such as  workers  or racial monorities, but was rather a purely popular uprising, superseding  ethnic ,  cultural ,  age  and  class  boundaries.   It began as a series of  student strikes  that broke out at a number of  universities  and  high schools  in  Paris , following confrontations with university administrators and the police. The  de Gaulle  administration's attempts to quash those strikes by further police action only inflamed the situation further, leading to street battles with the police in the  Latin Quarter , followed by a general strike by students and strikes throughout France by ten million French workers, roughly two-thirds of the French workforce. The protests reached the point that de Gaulle created a military operations headquarters to deal with the unrest, dissolved the  National Assembly  and called for new parliamentary elections for 23 June 1968.   The government was close to collapse at that point (De Gaulle had even taken temporary refuge at an airforce base in Germany), but the revolutionary situation evaporated almost as quickly as it arose. Workers went back to their jobs, urged on by the  Confdration Gnrale du Travail , the leftist union federation, and the  Parti Communiste Franais  (PCF), the French  Communist  Party. When the elections were finally held in June, the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before.   Most of the protesters espoused  left-wing  causes,  communism  or  anarchism . Many saw the events as an opportunity to shake up the ""old society"" in many social aspects, including methods of  education ,  sexual freedom  and  free love . A small minority of protesters, such as the  Occident  group, espoused  far-right  causes.   On 29 May several hundred thousand protesters led by the CGT marched through Paris, chanting,  ""Adieu, de Gaulle!""   While the government appeared to be close to collapse, de Gaulle chose not to say  adieu . Instead, after ensuring that he had sufficient loyal military units mobilized to back him if push came to shove, he went on the radio the following day (the national television service was on strike) to announce the dissolution of the National Assembly, with elections to follow on 23 June. He ordered workers to return to work, threatening to institute a  state of emergency  if they did not.   From that point the revolutionary feeling of the students and workers faded away. Workers gradually returned to work or were ousted from their plants by the police. The national student union called off street demonstrations. The government banned a number of left organizations. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. De Gaulle triumphed in the elections held in June and the crisis had ended.     [ edit ]   Chinese Cultural Revolution       Main article:  Cultural Revolution       The  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China  passed ""the 16 Points"" during the  Chinese Cultural Revolution .   The decision thus took the already existing student movement and elevated to the level of a nationwide mass campaign, calling on not only students but also ""the masses of the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres"" to carry out the task of ""transforming the superstructure."" The freedoms granted in the 16 Points were later written into the PRC constitution as ""the four great rights ()"" of ""great democracy ()"": the right to speak out freely, to air one's views fully, to write big-character posters, and to hold great debates. The first two of these are basically Chinese  synonyms ; in other contexts the second was sometimes replaced by  - the right to ""link up,"" meaning for students to cut class and travel across the country to meet other young activists and propagate  Mao Zedong Thought . All four of these freedoms were supplemented by the right to strike, although this supplemental right was severely attenuated by the  People's Liberation Army 's entrance onto the stage of civilian mass politics in February 1967. Ultimately all such rights were deleted from the constitution after the  Dengist  government suppressed the Democracy Wall movement in 1979.   On August 16, 1966, millions of  Red Guards  from all over the country gathered in  Beijing  for a peek at the Chairman. On top of the  Tiananmen Square  gate,  Mao  and  Lin Biao  made frequent appearances to approximately 11 million Red Guards, receiving cheers each time. Mao praised their actions in the recent campaigns to develop socialism and democracy.   For two years, until July 1968 and in some places much longer, student activists such as the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority, and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism, and posting the names of suspected "" counter-revolutionaries "" on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held ""great debates,"" and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticism from suspected ""counter-revolutionaries."" Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the chief Maoist leaders forbade ""physical struggle"" () in favor of ""verbal struggle"" (), these ""struggle sessions"" often led to physical violence. Initially verbal struggles among activist groups became even more violent when the Red Guard activists began to seize weapons from the Army in 1967. The Maoist leadership limited their intervention in this violence to verbal criticism, sometimes even appearing to encourage it. Only after the Red Guard weapons seizures began did the leadership begin to suppress the mass movement it had previously praised.   Liu Shaoqi  was sent to a detention camp, where he later died in 1969.  Deng Xiaoping , who was himself sent for a period of re-education three times, was sent to work in an engine  factory , until he was brought back years later by  Zhou Enlai . But most of those accused were not so lucky, and many of them never returned.   The work of the Red Guards was praised by Mao Zedong. On August 22, 1966, Mao issued a public notice, which stopped ""all  police  intervention in Red Guard  tactics  and actions."" Those in the police force who dared to defy this notice were labeled ""counter-revolutionaries.""     [ edit ]   Tlatelolco Massacre, Mexico       Main article:  Tlatelolco Massacre       The  Tlatelolco Massacre , also known as  Tlatelolco's Night  (from a book title), took place on the afternoon and night of October 2, 1968, in the  Plaza de las Tres Culturas  in the  Tlatelolco  section of  Mexico City . The death toll remains uncertain: some estimates place the number of deaths in the thousands, but most sources report 200-300 deaths. Many more were wounded, and several thousand arrests occurred.   The massacre was preceded by months of political unrest in the Mexican capital, echoing student demonstrations and riots all over the world during 1968. The Mexican students wanted to exploit the attention focused on Mexico City for the  1968 Summer Olympics .  President   Gustavo Daz Ordaz , however, was determined to stop the demonstrations and, in September, he ordered the army to occupy the campus of the  National Autonomous University of Mexico , the largest university in  Latin America . Students were beaten and arrested indiscriminately.  Rector  Javier Barros Sierra resigned in protest on September 23.   Student demonstrators were not deterred, however. The demonstrations grew in size, until on October 2, after student strikes lasting nine weeks, 15,000 students from various universities marched through the streets of Mexico City, carrying red carnations to protest the army's occupation of the university campus. By nightfall, 5,000 students and workers, many of them with spouses and children, had congregated outside an apartment complex in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas in Tlatelolco for what was supposed to be a peaceful rally. Among their chants were  Mxico  Libertad  Mxico  Libertad  (""Mexico  Liberty  Mexico Liberty""). Rally organizers attempted to call off the protest when they noticed an increased military presence in the area.   The massacre began at sunset when army and police forcesequipped with armored cars and tankssurrounded the square and began firing live rounds into the crowd, hitting not only the protestors, but also other people who were present for reasons unrelated to the demonstration. Demonstrators and passersby alike, including children, were caught in the fire; soon, mounds of bodies lay on the ground. The killing continued through the night, with soldiers carrying out mopping-up operations on a house-to-house basis in the apartment buildings adjacent to the square. Witnesses to the event claim that the bodies were later removed in garbage trucks.   The official government explanation of the incident was that armed provocateurs among the demonstrators, stationed in buildings overlooking the crowd, had begun the firefight. Suddenly finding themselves sniper targets, the security forces had simply returned fire in self-defense.     [ edit ]   Prague Spring       Main article:  Prague Spring              Prague Spring memorial plate in  Koice ,  Slovakia       The  Prague Spring  ( Czech :  Prask jaro ,  Slovak :  Prask jar ,  Russian :  ) was a period of political liberalization in  Czechoslovakia  starting January 5, 1968 and running until August 20 of that year when the  Soviet Union  and its  Warsaw Pact  allies (except for  Romania ) invaded the country.   During  World War II  Czechoslovakia fell into the Soviet sphere of influence, the  Eastern Bloc . Since 1948 there were no parties other than the  Communist Party  in the country and it was indirectly managed by the Soviet Union. Unlike other countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the communist take-over in Czechoslovakia in 1948 was, although as brutal as elsewhere, a genuine popular movement. Reform in the country did not lead to the convulsions seen in  Hungary .   Towards the end of World War II  Joseph Stalin  wanted Czechoslovakia, and signed an agreement with  Winston Churchill  and  Franklin D. Roosevelt , that  Prague  would be liberated by the  Red Army  despite the fact that the  United States Army  under General  George S. Patton  could have liberated the city earlier. This was important for the spread of pro-Russian (and pro-communist)  propaganda  that came right after the war. People still remembered what they felt as Czechoslovakia's betrayal by the West at the  Munich Agreement . For these reasons the people voted for communists in the 1948 elections - the last democratic poll for a long time.   From the middle of the 1960s Czechs and Slovaks showed increasing signs of rejection of the existing regime. This change was reflected by reformist elements within the communist party by installing  Alexander Dubek  as party leader. Dubek's reforms of the political process inside Czechoslovakia, which he referred to as  Socialism with a human face , did not represent a complete overthrow of the old regime, as was the case in  Hungary in 1956 . Dubek's changes had broad support from the society, including the  working class . However, it was still seen by the Soviet leadership as a threat to their hegemony over other states of the Eastern Bloc and to the very safety of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia was in the middle of the defensive line of the Warsaw Pact and its possible defection to the enemy was unacceptable during the  Cold War .   However a sizeable minority in the ruling party, especially at higher leadership levels, was opposed to any lessening of the party's grip on society and they actively plotted with the leadership of the Soviet Union to overthrow the reformers. This group watched in horror as calls for multi-party elections and other reforms began echoing throughout the country.   Between the nights of August 20 and August 21, 1968, Eastern Bloc armies from five Warsaw Pact countries invaded Czechoslovakia. During the invasion, Soviet tanks ranging in numbers from 5,000 to 7,000 occupied the streets. They were followed by a large number of Warsaw Pact troops ranging from 200,000 to 600,000.   The Soviets insisted that they had been invited to invade the country, stating that loyal Czechoslovak Communists had told them that they were in need of ""fraternal assistance against the  counter-revolution "". A letter which was found in 1989 proved an invitation to invade did indeed exist. During the attack of the Warsaw Pact armies, 72  Czechs  and  Slovaks  were killed (19 of those in  Slovakia ) and hundreds were wounded (up to September 3, 1968). Alexander Dubek called upon his people not to resist. He was arrested and taken to  Moscow , along with several of his colleagues.     [ edit ]   Japan 1960   Japan's biggest postwar political crisis took place in 1960 over the revision of the Japan-United States Mutual Security Assistance Pact. As the new  Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security  was concluded, which renewed the United States role as military protector of Japan, massive street protests and political upheaval occurred, and the cabinet resigned a month after the Diet's ratification of the treaty. Thereafter, political turmoil subsided. Japanese views of the United States, after years of mass protests over nuclear armaments and the mutual defense pact, improved by 1972, with the reversion of United States-occupied  Okinawa  to Japanese sovereignty and the winding down of the  Vietnam War .
