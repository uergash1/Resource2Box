The Task Force reviewed relevant UW documents and also looked at plans and practices in other universities. In 2004 the Task Force surveyed library staff in order to identify issues of diversity important to the staff and identify areas that need attention or improvement. Survey results showed diversity is important to our staff, and that the most important issue is being able to support our diverse user community effectively (Appendix 1). However, the staff also perceives that the Libraries can do a better job in addressing diversity issues, especially in recruiting a diverse work force and in supporting the needs of our diverse user community.      At the same time the LibrariesDiversity Task Force was working on the survey and plan, the University of Washington was conducting a Diversity Appraisal. The Appraisal Steering Committee asked all units across all three campuses to document their diversity initiatives and practices. The Diversity Appraisal is just one of many ways the UW administration is seeking to incorporate greater awareness of diversity issues into University operations. It is within this culture of diversity awareness that the LibrariesTask Force has written this plan.       The University of Washington defines diversity broadly to include ace, gender, disability, class, sexual identity/orientation, religion, age, ethnicity, culture, region/geography, and indigenous status.  Respect for all human diversity is a fundamental value of the Libraries and is identified among the core values of our strategic plan. Staff members who appreciate different backgrounds and perspectives provide us with a competitive advantage as we approach problem solving and planning for services. This appreciation also allows us to serve our increasingly diverse communities more effectively and with more sensitivity.       Beyond respect for diversity, it is important to recognize that inequity can often accompany diversity. This plan is meant to foster and support an organizational culture where those inequities do not occur or are remedied when identified.      Libraries personnel at all levels of the organization are responsible for developing and maintaining a culture supportive of and committed to diversity. However, in order to expedite implementation of the plan and provide support and guidance, the Diversity Task Force recommends that the establishment of a Diversity Officer position and a standing Diversity Committee be the first actions taken (see Goal #5). The Diversity Officer and Committee should begin action on the ithin 6 monthsitems immediately as they are of the highest priority. The remaining action items where implementation is recommended within twelve months should be prioritized by the Committee. Where funds and workload implications of others are incurred in the execution of the Plan, the responsible party(ies) will develop a plan.     Recruitment of staff from diverse backgrounds          Goal: To increase the diversity of the Librariesworkforce at all levels of the organization                    Action Items:              Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Administrative Officer Responsible for Personnel (AORP); Staff Development      Within 6 Months    Review our recruitment policies and procedures so that they support the UW Libraries commitment to diversity Initiate a conversation between the iSchool Diversity Committee and the Libraries Diversity Committee to explore collaboration Investigate the costs and effectiveness of residency programs for minority librarians and develop a proposal if appropriate (2005-2006)     Within 12 Months    Establish mentoring program for staff who may want to pursue a library degree, collaborating with the i-School Work with the University to take advantage of hiring opportunities that promote a diverse Libraries staff Proactively promote UW Libraries as a place in which to work Establish opportunities for students interested in working in libraries as a career to participate in mentored work programs       Retention of staff from diverse backgrounds       Goal: Promote an inclusive and supportive workplace culture as an important element in retaining a diverse staff        Action Items:        Within 12 Months    Support opportunities for professional development and/or growth, and mentoring/networking for all staff        Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Libraries Council; Staff Development; Librarian Advisory Program (LAP) Facilitate connections between new hires and groups/resources at the university and in the community    Implementation: Diversity Committee; Diversity Officer; Staff Development Officer, UL Staff Work with the University to enhance salary and compensation flexibility to retain a diverse library staff    Implementation: Dean of the Libraries; AORP       Organizational Culture       Goal: To incorporate awareness of the value and importance of diversity at all levels of the Libraries so that staff recognize their responsibility in maintaining a culture supportive of and committed to diversity; provide a supportive and safe working and learning environment      Action Items:        Implementation: Diversity Officer; Diversity Committee; Staff Development        Within 6 months    Provide ongoing staff training to foster individual responsibility for maintenance of a supportive and safe working and learning environment, with particular attention to the role of supervisors and managers to eliminate or remedy inequities when they are identified Highlight and promote the diversity of the libraries staff through programs and publications throughout the organization, i.e. Inforum, Library Directions, and LSA Enhance the Staff Development collection with diversity related materials including academic librarianship, higher education and organizational development       Services to Constituents       Goal: To enrich the quality of life and advance intellectual discovery by connecting people of diverse backgrounds and ethnicities with knowledge      Action Items:        Within 6 Months    Develop and implement ongoing staff training in order to improve staff members' abilities to provide excellent service to all our diverse users, especially with regards to primary language barriers and physical/mental disabilities.

As we slide further towards what seems to be an inevitable recession, more companies may have to cut back  on benefits and perks, many of which are used as incentives to attract and retain diversity employees.          juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Most Companies Believe in Workplace Diversity, But Few Can Actually Define It                          Mar 17, 2008                   The Society for Human Resource Management has found that most organizations believe workplace diversity is important, but  only 30 percent  have an official definition of it, and most respondents said there is no common language to guide companies in managing their diversity efforts. The survey asked more than 1,400 HR professionals and diversity practitioners to rate how well their company's diversity practices accomplished their specific business objectives.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Banking Industry's Failure to Increase Diversity In Management Will Be Costly                          Feb 22, 2008                   According to banking and finance industry officials testimony before a congressional oversight panel, banks and other financial institutions have made very little progress in increasing workforce diversity over the last ten years.  This disturbing news comes despite the fact that these institutions have had dedicated workplace diversity programs in place for more than a decade.  Industry officials also speculate that the percentage of women and minorities in high level positions in banking and finance has probably been exaggerated.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               Most Companies With Diversity Policies Don't Have  Minority Executives                          Jan 30, 2008                   A new study has found that 76 percent of global senior executives say that their companies have one or  no minorities  among their top five executives, despite the fact that a majority of the companies (54 percent) have implemented workplace diversity policies.            juan rodriguez's blog   Add new comment   Read more               How to Stop Workplace Discrimination and Create A Healthy Working Environment                          Jan 25, 2008                   No matter how anyone tries to spin it, discrimination in the workplace is  illegal .

Equal Employment Opportunity   What is Equal Employment Opportunity?   The Merit Principle   What are EEO groups?   What is Affirmative Action?     What is Equal Employment Opportunity?   Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) gives all people the right to be considered for any job for which they are skilled and qualified, ensuring that the best person for the job is employed. EEO is based on the principle of recruiting and promoting people on merit.   EEO also promotes a working environment free from harassment of any kind, and access for all staff to job-related opportunities, eg. training and development, promotion and reclassification.       Return to Top     The Merit Principle   Merit is the basis of equal employment opportunity in Australia. The merit principle aims to ensure that the best person for the job is employed. It gives all people the right to be considered for a job on the basis of their abilities, qualifications, experience, and standard of work performance.       Return to Top     What are EEO groups?   Particular groups of people have traditionally been disadvantaged in employment, because of discriminatory laws, rules, employment practices, stereotypes and attitudes. NSW legislation defines these groups, sometimes referred to as 'EEO groups', as         Indigenous Australians       people who speak a first language other than English       women       people with a disability     The University has a legal obligation to eliminate discrimination and harassment and to promote equality of opportunity for members of EEO groups.   Return to Top         What is Affirmative Action?   Members of EEO groups may not have had equal access to job opportunities or training and development for reasons such as past discrimination or prejudice, different educational experience, or being locked into low opportunity jobs. Affirmative Action (AA) strategies aim to redress these past disadvantages and improve employment outcomes for people from EEO groups. The principle of Affirmative Action acknowledges that equal treatment may not produce equal outcomes; differential treatment may be required to achieve real equity.   Examples of Affirmative Action at UTS include the  Wingara Strategy  to promote Indigenous employment; the  inpUTS Educational Access Scheme  and the  Women@UTS Program .
