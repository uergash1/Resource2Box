Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck.

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

clueweb09-en0004-45-33079	  I took this picture in the Sea/Tac airport a few years ago (1999? 2000?) while enjoying a grande mocha Frappuccino TM .  It's actually a picture of a person, that happened to include the Starbucks kiosk sign, but in this scan I have cropped it to just the logo.   Notice that although at first glance it looks just like the current Starbucks logo you see everywhere, it's actually different — the whole mermaid is visible.  (Also, her tail fins have three points instead of the modern two.)  In the modern logo, she's cropped to show less of her.  I heard a rumor that they did that to appease people who thought this logo offensive, since it sort-of looks like she's spreading her legs.  Irrespective of that, I think the modern logo looks better than this one.      Update:  Simon Quinn sent me  this picture  of an even more risque Starbucks logo, purportedly in front of the  original  Starbucks in Seattle!  Check it out.    Back to my  homepage .

Starbucks is the largest  coffeehouse  company in the world, [ 2 ]  with 16,120 stores in 44 countries. [ 3 ]  Starbucks sells  drip brewed coffee ,  espresso -based hot drinks, other hot and cold drinks, snacks, and items such as mugs and coffee beans. Through the Starbucks Entertainment division and  Hear Music  brand, the company also markets books, music, and film. Many of the company's products are seasonal or specific to the locality of the store. Starbucks-brand ice cream and coffee are also sold at grocery stores.   From Starbucks' founding in Seattle as a local  coffee bean  roaster and retailer, the company has expanded rapidly. In the 1990s, Starbucks was opening a new store every workday, a pace that continued into the 2000s. Domestic growth has since slowed, although the company continues to expand in foreign markets and will open a net of 900 new stores outside of the U.S. in 2009. [ 4 ]  The first location outside of the United States and Canada was established in 1990s, and they now constitute almost one third of Starbucks' stores. [ 5 ]   As of early 2009, Starbucks has more than 16,000 stores in 58 countries worldwide, 11,006 of which are located in the United States, followed by Canada with 976 and Japan with 845 locations. On July 1, 2008, the company announced it was closing 600 under-performing company-owned stores and cutting U.S. expansion plans amid growing economic uncertainty. [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  On July 29, 2008, Starbucks also cut almost 1,000 non-retail jobs as part of its bid to re-energize the brand and boost its profit. Of the new cuts, 550 of the positions are layoffs and the rest are unfilled jobs. [ 8 ]  These closings and layoffs have effectively ended the companys period of growth and expansion that began in the mid-1990s.   On January 28, 2009, Starbucks announced the closure of an additional 300 under-performing stores, and the elimination of 7,000 positions. CEO Howard Schultz also announced that he had received board approval to reduce his salary.

Located in the old Sears, Roebuck and Co. catalog distribution center building.       The original Starbucks was opened in Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, in 1971 by three partners: English teacher  Jerry Baldwin , history teacher  Zev Siegel , and writer  Gordon Bowker . The three were inspired by  Alfred Peet , whom they knew personally, to open their first store in  Pike Place Market  to sell high-quality coffee beans and equipment. The original Starbucks location was at 2000 Western Avenue from 19711976. That store then moved to 1912 Pike Place; it is still open. During their first year of operation, they purchased green  coffee beans  from  Peet's , then began buying directly from growers.   Entrepreneur  Howard Schultz  joined the company in 1982, and, after a trip to  Milan, Italy , advised that the company should sell coffee and  espresso  drinks as well as beans. The owners rejected this idea, believing that getting into the beverage business would distract the company from its primary focus. To them,  coffee  was something to be prepared in the home. Certain that there was much money to be made selling drinks to on-the-go Americans, Schultz started the  Il Giornale  coffee bar chain in 1985.   In 1984, the original owners of Starbucks, led by Baldwin, took the opportunity to purchase Peet's (Baldwin still works there today). In 1987, they sold the Starbucks chain to Schultz's Il Giornale, which rebranded the Il Giornale outlets as Starbucks and quickly began to expand. Starbucks opened its first locations outside Seattle at  Waterfront Station  in  Vancouver ,  British Columbia , and  Chicago ,  Illinois , that same year. At the time of its  initial public offering  on the stock market in 1992, Starbucks had grown to 165 outlets.    The first Starbucks location outside of North America opened in  Tokyo  in 1996. Starbucks entered the  U.K.  market in 1998 with the acquisition of the then 60-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all its stores as Starbucks. By November 2005,  London  had more outlets than  Manhattan , [ 10 ]  a sign of Starbucks becoming an international brand.          A Starbucks coffee shop in  Leeds ,  United Kingdom       In 1999, Starbucks experimented with eateries in the San Francisco Bay area through a restaurant chain called Circadia. [ 11 ]  These restaurants were soon ""outed"" as Starbucks establishments and converted to Starbucks cafes.   In April 2003, Starbucks completed the purchase of  Seattle's Best Coffee  and  Torrefazione Italia  from  AFC Enterprises , bringing the total number of Starbucks-operated locations worldwide to more than 6,400. On September 14, 2006, rival  Diedrich Coffee  announced that it would sell most of its company-owned retail stores to Starbucks. This sale includes the company-owned locations of the Oregon-based  Coffee People  chain. Starbucks has converted the Diedrich Coffee and Coffee People locations to Starbucks as of summer 2007, although the Portland airport Coffee People locations were excluded from the sale. [ 12 ] [ 13 ]   Starbucks' chairman,  Howard Schultz , has talked about making sure growth does not dilute the company's culture  [ 14 ]  and the common goal of the company's leadership to act like a small company.          The first Starbucks branch.       In January 2008, Chairman  Howard Schultz  resumed his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer after an eight year hiatus, and replaced Jim Donald, who took those posts in 2005 but decided to leave the company in late 2007. Schultz's principal challenge is to restore what he calls the ""distinctive Starbucks experience"" in the face of rapid expansion. Analysts believe that Schultz must determine how to contend with higher materials prices and enhanced competition from lower-price fast food chains, including  McDonald's  and  Dunkin' Donuts . On January 31, 2008, Schultz announced that Starbucks would discontinue its warm breakfast sandwich products, originally scheduled to launch nationwide in 2008, in order to refocus the brand on all things coffee. On February 23, Starbucks closed its stores from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time to train its baristas. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   As Starbucks often tests new products as part of its ongoing innovation and transformation, Starbucks started testing selling an 8 oz ""short"" brewed coffee for $1 and giving free refills on all brewed coffee. This test was limited to the greater Seattle market, with no plans for expansion to national markets. Per an internal email this program was cancelled in late March 2008.          A typical sales area, this one in  Peterborough ,  UK , showing a display of food and the beverage preparation area       In March 2008, Schultz made several announcements to Starbucks  shareholders . Shultz introduced Starbucks' ""state of the art espresso system"", [ 17 ]  the  Thermoplan AG  manufactured Mastrena, which replaced their previous superauto, the Thermoplan Verismo 801(known internationally as the Thermoplan Black & White). Starbucks also announced that the company hopes to enter the energy drink market and introduce a customer reward program. Pre-ground beans will also no longer be used, in order that the additional grinding of all whole bean coffee will ""bring aroma, romance and theater"" to American stores. [ 18 ]  The company also announced the recent acquisition of The Coffee Equipment Company, [ 17 ]  the manufacturer of the Clover Brewing System. They are currently test marketing this unique ""fresh-pressed"" coffee system at six Starbucks locations, three in Seattle, and three in Boston. [ 19 ]   In May 2008, a rewards program was initiated for registered users of the Starbucks Card. Previously simply a gift card, the Starbucks Card has undergone a transition into a rewards card, similar to cards offered by other retail outlets. Perks and rewards offered to registered users are 2 hours of free Wi-Fi Internet service per day, free refills of brewed coffee (some locations only honour this for the first 3 hours of your stay), a free tall beverage with the purchase of 1 lb. of whole bean coffee, as well as free milk (e.g. soy) and syrup drink modifiers. [ 20 ]  This is a new and aggressive approach by Starbucks to create and strengthen customer loyalty.   Tags displaying the title ""Master"" are worn by employees who have completed the Coffee Master course, which educates employees in not only the tasting, but also growing regions, roasting, and purchasing (including  fair trade  practices) aspects of the coffee industry. Almost 70% of the coffee used by Starbucks around the world comes from the sixth major producer in the world,  Guatemala , a pro-organic producer.   Starting in November of 2008 Starbucks began selling Product Red goods. According to the website because of this they have been able to provide AIDS medicine for 3,800 for an entire year. [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Intellectual property   Starbucks U.S. Brands, LLC, is a Starbucks-owned company that currently holds and owns the property rights to approximately 120 Starbucks Coffee Company patents and trademarks. It is located at 2525 Starbucks Way in  Minden, Nevada . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Name   The company is named in part after  Starbuck ,  Captain Ahab 's  first mate  in the book  Moby-Dick , as well as a turn-of-the-century mining camp ( Starbo  or  Storbo ) on  Mount Rainier . According to  Howard Schultz 's book  Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time , the name of the company was derived from  Moby-Dick , although not in as direct a fashion as many assume. Gordon Bowker liked the name ""Pequod"" (the ship in the novel), but his then creative partner Terry Heckler responded, ""No one's going to drink a cup of Pee-quod!"" Heckler suggested ""Starbo"". Brainstorming with these two ideas resulted in the company being named for the  Pequod' s first mate, Starbuck. [ 23 ]          A Starbucks location in the  insa-dong  district of  Seoul ,  South Korea . This particular location is a rarity in that the main sign is not written in  English .

[ 25 ]  The logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. In the first version, which gave the impression of an authentic 15th century European  woodcut , the Starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. The image also had a rough visual texture. In the second version, which was used from 1987-92, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her  navel  was still visible, and the fish tail was cropped slightly. In the current version, used since 1992, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. The original ""woodcut"" logo can still be seen on the Starbucks store in Seattle's Pike Place Market, and on both the House Blend and Decaf House Blend packaging.   At the beginning of September 2006 and then again in early 2008, Starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot drink cups. Starbucks has stated that this was done to show the company's heritage from the Pacific Northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. The vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the siren's bare breasts, [ 26 ]  but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. Starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   Parodies and infringements     [ edit ]   Environmental record          Starbucks inside  Tsutaya  in  Shibuya ,  Japan       In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business more environment friendly. ""Grounds for your Garden"" is a year round program that gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and rally their local Starbucks to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 1.8 million pounds. [ 28 ] The U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  granted the first-ever approval to use recycled content in  food packaging  for Starbucks coffee cups. In 2005 Starbucks received the National Recycling Coalition Recycling Works Award. [ 29 ]  In 2008, Starbucks was ranked #15 on the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency 's list of Top 25 Green Power Partners for purchases of renewable energy. [ 30 ]   Starbucks has also received criticism from environmentalists. ""Dr. Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says that Starbucks claimed they were using only 10 percent recycled material partly because the recycled material costs more."" [ 31 ]  In October 2008, The UK newspaper  The Sun  reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million litres of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a ' dipper well ' in each of its stores worldwide. [ 32 ]   Does anyone know other environmental impact stats for Starbucks annually-- Asiachai  ( talk ) 17:30, 16 March 2009 (UTC)     [ edit ]   Criticism and controversy          Starbucks at the  Forbidden City  in  Beijing  (closed since July 2007)       Several activist groups maintain websites criticizing the company's  fair-trade  policies, labor relations, and environmental impact, and hold it as a prime example of U.S. cultural and economic  imperialism . Several Starbucks locations were vandalized during the  WTO   meeting held in Seattle in late 1999 .   The Starbucks location in the former imperial palace in Beijing closed in July 2007. The coffee shop had been a source of ongoing controversy since its opening in 2000 with protesters objecting that the presence of the American chain in this location ""was trampling on Chinese culture"". [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Anti-competitive tactics   Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position include buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. [ 37 ]  For example, Starbucks fueled its initial expansion into the UK market with a buyout of Seattle Coffee Company, but then used its capital and influence to obtain prime locations, some of which operated at a financial loss. Critics claimed this was an unfair attempt to drive out small, independent competitors, who could not afford to pay inflated prices for premium real estate. [ 38 ]     [ edit ]   Labor disputes   Starbucks workers throughout seven different stores have joined the  Industrial Workers of the World  (IWW) as the  Starbucks Workers Union  since 2004. [ 39 ]          Starbucks in the  Financial District  of  Boston, Massachusetts       According to a Starbucks Union press release, since then, the union membership has begun expanding to Chicago and Maryland in addition to  New York City  where the movement originated. [ 40 ]  On March 7, 2006, the IWW and Starbucks agreed to a  National Labor Relations Board  settlement in which three Starbucks workers were granted almost US$2,000 in back wages and two fired employees were offered reinstatement. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ]  According to the Starbucks Union, on November 24, 2006, IWW members picketed Starbucks locations in more than 50 cities around the world in countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the UK, as well as U.S. cities including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis and San Francisco, [ 44 ]  to protest the firing of five Starbucks Workers Union organizers by Starbucks and to demand their reinstatement.   Some Starbucks baristas in Canada, [ 45 ]  Australia and New Zealand, [ 46 ]  and the United States [ 47 ]  belong to a variety of unions. In 2005, Starbucks paid out US$165,000 to eight employees at its Kent, Washington, roasting plant to settle charges that they had been retaliated against for being pro-union. At the time, the plant workers were represented by the  IUOE . Starbucks admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement. [ 39 ]          A Starbucks located in  Lima ,  Peru       A Starbucks strike occurred in  Auckland ,  New Zealand , on November 23, 2005. [ 46 ]  Organized by  Unite Union , workers sought secure hours, a  minimum wage  of NZ$12 an hour, and the abolition of youth rates. The company settled with the Union in 2006, resulting in pay increases, increased security of hours, and an improvement in youth rates. [ 48 ]   According to Starbucks Chairman Howard Schulz, ""If they had faith in me and my motives, they wouldn't need a union."" [ 49 ]  According to  The Seattle Times , ""The International Union of Operating Engineers Local 286 had trouble with Starbucks at its Kent roasting plant, where the union no longer represents workers"". [ 39 ]   In March 2008, Starbucks was ordered to pay  baristas  over  US$ 100 million in back tips in a  Californian   class action lawsuit  launched by baristas alleging that granting shift-supervisors a portion of  tips  violates state  labor laws . The Company plans to appeal. Similarly, an 18 year-old barista in Chestnut Hill, MA has just filed another suit with regards to the tipping policy. Massachusetts law also states that managers may not get a cut of tips.  [ 50 ] [ 51 ]  A similar lawsuit was also filed in Minnesota on March 27, 2008.  [ 52 ]     [ edit ]   Coffee bean market   In 2000, the company introduced a line of  fair trade  products. [ 53 ]   Of the approximately 136,000 tonnes (300 million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, about 6 percent was certified as fair trade. [ 54 ]   According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 tonnes (4.8 million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 tonnes (11.5 million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, [ 55 ]  the only third-party certifier of Fair Trade Certified coffee in the United States, has noted the impact Starbucks has made in the area of Fair Trade and coffee farmer's lives by saying:       Since launching {its} FTC coffee line in 2000, Starbucks has undeniably made a significant contribution to family farmers through their rapidly growing FTC coffee volume. By offering FTC coffee in thousands of stores, Starbucks has also given the FTC label greater visibility, helping to raise consumer awareness in the process.       Groups such as  Global Exchange  are calling for Starbucks to further increase its sales of fair trade coffees. Fair trade certification can cost US$2,500 to US$10,000, based on the size of the producer group and length of time the inspections take, and many growers are unwilling or unable to pay for certification. [ 56 ]   Beyond Fair Trade Certification, Starbucks argues that it pays above market prices for all of its coffee. According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64kg) for high-quality coffee beans. [ 57 ]  This is in comparison to commodity prices which were as low as $0.50$0.60 in 20032004. [ 58 ]     [ edit ]   Ethos water controversy          A Starbucks located in  Trujillo ,  Per       Ethos , a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2005, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that $.05 from each $1.80 bottle sold ($.10 per unit in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over $6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit Starbucks brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects. [ 59 ] [ 60 ]  The founders of Ethos have stated that the brand is intended to raise awareness of third-world clean water issues and provide socially responsible consumers with an opportunity to support the cause by choosing Ethos over other brands. [ 61 ]  Starbucks has since redesigned the American version of the Ethos water bottles, stating the amount of money donated per bottle in the description.     [ edit ]   Brighton store opens in breach of planning regulations   In May 2008, a branch of Starbucks was completed in  Kemptown  on St. James's Street,  Brighton, England , despite having being refused permission by the local planning authority, Brighton and Hove City Council. They claimed there were too many coffee shops already present on the street. [ 62 ] [ 63 ]  Starbucks has appealed the decision, with Brighton and Hove council monitoring the situation. [ 64 ]   Brighton & Hove City Council have served Starbucks with an enforcement notice (which they have appealed) to remove all tables and chairs from the premises in order to comply with planning regulations and operate as an A1 retail shop, rather than an A3 coffee shop/restaurant, for which they have no planning permission. The deadline of the enforcement is 20 February 2009. [ 65 ]     [ edit ]   Alleged relationship with the Israeli military   There have been calls for boycott of Starbucks stores and products because it is alleged that Starbucks sends part of its profits to the  Israeli military . [ 66 ]  It has been long alleged that Schultz is ""an active  Zionist ""  [ 67 ]  and is a recipient of several Israeli awards including ""The Israel 50th Anniversary Tribute Award"" for ""playing a key role in promoting a close alliance between the United States and Israel."" [ 68 ]  In response to these allegations Starbucks issued a statement saying Neither Chairman Howard Schultz nor Starbucks fund or support the Israeli Army. Starbucks is a non-political organization and does not support individual political causes. [ 69 ]  Starbucks has been a regular target of activists protesting against the  Israeli intervention in Gaza . Starbucks was forced to close a store in  Beirut ,  Lebanon  because of demonstrators shouting anti-Israel slogans and causing customers to flee. [ 70 ]  Protesters in Beirut told the  Associated Press  that they targeted Starbucks because they claim Chairman and CEO Howard Schultz donates money to the Israeli military. They hung several banners on the shop's window and used white tape to paste a  Star of David  over the green-and-white Starbucks sign. They also distributed a letter saying Schultz ""is one of the pillars of the American  Jewish lobby  and the owner of the Starbucks,"" which they said donates money to the Israeli military. [ 71 ]  Starbucks responded by saying ""Rumors that Starbucks Coffee Company and its management support Israel are unequivocally false. ... Starbucks is a nonpolitical organization and does not support political causes. Further, political preferences of a Starbucks partner [employee] at any level have absolutely no bearing on Starbucks company policies."" [ 72 ]     [ edit ]   Violence against Starbucks in the United Kingdom   On January 12, 2009, a Starbucks in Whitechapel Road in  London  was the target of vandalism by pro- Palestinian  demonstrators broke windows and reportedly ripped out fittings and equipment after clashes with riot police. Later the same day, after midnight, a suspected makeshift firebomb was hurled into the premises, causing further damage. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ]   On January 17, 2009, at an anti-Israel protest held by the  Stop the War Coalition  in  Trafalgar Square  in central  London , British Rapper  Lowkey  stated, with regard to Starbucks, that: ""You say you know about the Zionist lobby but you put money in their pockets every time youre buying their coffee."" After the rally, two groups of people, many wearing scarves over their faces, smashed and looted two Starbucks on Piccadilly and Shaftesbury Avenue. Although the Starbucks stores had requested greater police protection following the violence against a Starbucks the previous week,  Scotland Yard  stated it could ""not stop thugs hell-bent on causing damage."" [ 76 ] [ 74 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ]     [ edit ]   Accusations by Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi   In a sermon delivered by Muslim cleric Sheikh  Yusuf al-Qaradawi , which aired on  Al Jazeera TV  on January 9, 2009 (as translated by MEMRI), Al-Qaradhawi accused Starbucks of supporting Israeli education and the Israeli Army and called for a boycott of the company and other western chains. [ 79 ]  Al-Qaradawi has previously called for a similar boycott of all US products with limited success. [ 80 ]  Starbucks has not commented directly on Al-Qaradawi's accusations, but has in the past, denied supporting Israel or any other political action. [ 73 ]     [ edit ]   Other ventures   Main article:  Hear Music   Starbucks entered the music industry in 1999 with the acquisition of Hear Music, and the film industry in 2006 with the creation of Starbucks Entertainment. Starbucks Entertainment was one of the producers of the 2006 film  Akeelah and the Bee . Retail stores heavily advertised the film before its release.   Hear Music is the brand name of Starbucks' retail music concept. Hear Music began as a catalog company in 1990 and was purchased by Starbucks in 1999. Nearly three years later, in 2002, they produced a Starbucks opera album, featuring artists such as  Luciano Pavarotti .     [ edit ]   Partnership with Apple   Starbucks has agreed to a partnership with  Apple  to collaborate on selling music as part of the coffeehouse experience. In October 2006, Apple added a Starbucks Entertainment area to the  iTunes Store , selling similar music that appeared in Starbucks stores. In September 2007 Apple announced that there would be wireless communication between Apple and Starbucks. Through the AT&T Wi-Fi, a paywall is opened up to allow any individual connecting to AT&T wifi access to the  iTunes Store  (regardless of whether he or she is an AT&T subscriber). The partnership is primarily targeted at  iPhone ,  iPod Touch , and  Macbook  users (although anyone with access to iTunes can take advantage of it). In addition, the iTunes Store will automatically detect the current and last 10 songs playing in a Starbucks and offer users connected to the store's wireless network the opportunity to download the tracks. This feature has been rolled out in  Seattle ,  New York City , and the  San Francisco Bay Area , and will slowly be offered in limited markets during 20072008. [ 81 ]  During the fall of 2007, Starbucks also began to sell digital downloads of certain albums through iTunes. The buyer would buy the download at Starbucks, and enter the code on the download card at the iTunes Store, and then the entire album would immediately start downloading. From October 2 to November 7, 2007, Starbucks gave away 37 different songs for free download through iTunes as part of the ""Song of the Day"" promotion. Each day, baristas would give out download cards for a particular song which could be redeemed on iTunes. Currently, every Tuesday, a new ""Pick of the Week"" download card is available at Starbucks for a free song download, similar to its previous ""Song of the Day.""

Last year about this time  Howard Schultz sent a memo  to his Starbucks executive team challenging them to get smarter about how they are running the company and to get back to the company's core business.  Starbucks CEO Jim Donald was charged with driving sales and driving innovation at the company.  In 2007, Starbucks stock value fell 48% and the company reported its first every year-over-year drop in customer traffic.  Donald is out and  Schultz is back as CEO .   The jury is still deliberating on Michael Dell and the turnaround of his company.   The jury is just convening about Howard Schultz and the turnaround of his company.

Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Television Advertising                         What?  On a  conference call with Wall Street analysts , Starbucks Coffee revealed fewer customers are visiting its stores and that year-over-year sales are stagnant.  The company  reported a 1.0% drop in customer traffic  as compared to the same period last year and despite two price increases, same store sales increased only 4.0% from the year prior.   In response, Starbucks announced a three-point plan to reverse their sluggish financial numbers. First, the company will attempt to sharpen its store-level operations to better deliver the “Starbucks Experience” customers have come to expect. Second, the company will focus on introducing new beverages that are more innovative and more appealing to customers. Third, Starbucks will l aunch a national television advertising campaign  in hopes of driving new customers into its stores as well as getting current customers to visit more often.   So What?  Since being a publicly traded company, Starbucks has never experienced a reduction in customer visits. Remarkably, they have always had more customers visiting its stores … until now. This is uncharted territory for Starbucks. And Starbucks is concerned.    Additionally, for nearly a decade, year-over-year sales at Starbucks have been very strong—anywhere from 7.0% to 13.0%. So the current trend where comp sales are stagnate in the low single-digits is quite alarming for Starbucks.   For many companies, the answer to the question of, “Sales are down and customer counts are falling, what should we do?” is to spend marketing dollars on creating a television-heavy advertising campaign. That hasn’t been the answer at Starbucks.   Starbucks has always followed the unconventional strategy of using its in-store experience as its main marketing tool. Everything about the Starbucks experience marketed the Starbucks business: the coffee in the iconic white logo cup, the personal interaction between a customer and a Starbucks barista, the in-store decor, the music playing overhead, the welcoming smell of the coffee, and the feeling customers had during their Starbucks “moment.”   As noted  in the conference call , Starbucks will continue down the unconventional path of spending marketing dollars to improve the customer’s in-store experience through better store operations and more appealing beverages.   But now, the company has also decided to follow the more conventional path to arresting declining sales through  launching a television advertising campaign .   According to Ad Age , we can expect to see three Holiday-focused animated 30-second spots running on select cable channels and network television channels.    This dramatic change in marketing strategy goes to show us how seriously the company is taking the soft comp sales and declining transaction comps. Starbucks is willing to risk its go-to-market strategy by spending significant monies on television ads to lure customers during the Holiday season.    To this marketer, it’s a little foolish to spend advertising dollars on television during the Holiday season without going all-out. I doubt Starbucks is putting mega-millions behind this television push. With so many retailers spending mega-millions on television advertising during the Holiday shopping season, the limited advertising spend from Starbucks is sure to get lost in all the ad clutter. Plus, I get the feeling these commercials will be go hard on pushing the relevance of the Starbucks brand during the Holidays and go very soft on selling specific products.   A smarter spend for Starbucks would be to go all-out during the Spring/Summer months and use television advertising to promote their promotion-friendly Frappuccino blended beverages. Starbucks has always treated their Frappuccino drinks as being more promotional than their other coffee drinks. For years, Starbucks has done regional radio, billboard, and print advertising to support their Frappuccino portfolio. They’ve come to believe this advertising push positively impacts sales and drives in new customers.   So why doesn’t Starbucks wait until the Spring/Summer months to go all-out with national television advertising? With sales already sluggish and customer traffic trending downward, the company doesn’t want to get too far behind their FY’08 sales goals. Keep in mind, Starbucks will generate around 25% of its 2008 sales during the six-weeks of Holiday. If the company falls behind early in hitting sales targets, 2008 could be a very rough year.   I believe this national television advertising push is a sign Starbucks is desperate to drive sales. Desperate enough to turn its back on the marketing strategy that has made Starbucks what it is today.   What Now?   We all get to sit back,  watch the Starbucks television commercials , and watch to see what impact this new marketing direction has on the Starbucks business and the Starbucks brand.                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Espresso Shots of Business Wisdom                         Aug.25, 2007  | On my day-to-day blog,  Brand Autopsy , I've started a series of audio/video postings sharing  Espresso Shots of Business Wisdom .  Each episode runs less than five minutes and shares business advice I've picked up through the years.  Much of this advice is from my days working inside Starbucks Coffee.  For more,  visit the Brand Autopsy blog .

If you haven’t read it, you can  read it here .   He’s concerned Starbucks is in danger of losing its soul, its uniqueness—its remarkability. Howard says the romance and theater of coffee have disappeared from Starbucks stores because Baristas now use push-button machines to make espresso drinks. That stores no longer smell like coffee and that every store looks cookie-cutter.    Howard closes the email by asking his executive team to get smarter about the business and to get more innovative to once again differentiate Starbucks.   Hmm … since we’ve all been to Starbucks (some of us more than once-a-day), we’re more than qualified to answer the same strategic question Howard asks of his executive team.           So, send me an  EMAIL   with  STARBUCKS  in the subject line. Tell me what Starbucks must do to reclaim its uniqueness? To better connect with customers? To become the coffee company it once was?    My plan is to compile your answers into a free ebook. (Of course that’s contingent upon receiving good answers.) So in your responses … don’t ramble. Be brief. Be smart. Be fast. I’d like to have this ebook posted by the end of March.           NOTE: Blatant inspiration from  Seth Godin  and his  What Should Google Do?  ebook.                Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Howards Concerns Are Not New                         Feb. 24   |  Howard Schultz, Starbucks Chairman and chief visionary,  recently sent a battle cry email  to key executives warning them of how decisions the company has made in the past 10 years is resulting in the commoditization of the Starbucks experience.  ( Read the entire email here .)   Howard is concerned Starbucks is not the same company it once was. He fears key decisions have led to “the watering down of the Starbucks experience."" And he challenged his executive team to guide Starbucks back to its core roots of being a coffee company.     As a former Starbucks marketer who worked at Starbucks from Oct. ’94 until Jan. ’03, nothing Howard says is new. Every decision Howard singles out in the memo as being damaging to the brand has sparked countless heated debates between old school Starbucks partners and new school Starbucks partners. I know. As one of the old school-minded Starbucks partners, I passionately objected to the introduction of automated espresso machines. I also was involved in intense discussions over the loss of coffee aroma in Starbucks locations.    These warning signs Howard mentions in the email of succumbing to the fast food mentality, the lost focus on coffee, and the commoditization of the Starbucks experience have been present for a long time.    In fact, there’s a vintage internal presentation from Starbucks which details the branding conundrum Howard highlights. That presentation is from February 4, 1999 and it’s just as relevant to the Starbucks brand today as it ways eight-years ago.  One telling slide says:                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Howard Schultzs Open Letter to Starbucks Partners                         Feb. 14, 2007  |  According to the Seattle Times , Starbucks Chairman, Howard Schultz, felt the need to send Starbucks employees a pep-talk letter.    Obviously Howard is bothered by some recent, but unnamed, criticism directed at Starbucks.      In my eight-years at Starbucks, Howard was never bothered enough to send such a letter to all employees.    On many occasions though, he would leave impassioned voicemails to all Starbucks stores.    However, voicemails are not able to reach all employees at all stores.    Only the store management team, including assistant managers and shift supervisors, listen to voicemails.    So sending a letter to every employee says a lot.      Read for yourself by clicking below:                        Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE in Entrepreneur Magazine                         Jan. 20, 2007  | The February issue of Entrepreneur Magazine includes an article highlighting recent books about Starbucks Coffee.  TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE is mentioned and the writer, Ken Henricks, drops in a few quotes from me about the importance of treating employees well if businesses seek to treat customers well.     Click below to access a .jpeg of the article.                      Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #6                         Jan. 3, 2007  | This is another installment of the “Starbucks Mailbag” posting where I give a perspective on questions I’ve received about Starbucks strategies and decisions.    This morning I received an email from a friend wanting to learn more about how Starbucks developed the culture of customers customizing their drinks. This friend is working with a quick service restaurant that’s considering implementing a “customizable” drink marketing program. He wants to know how they might be able to approach this “customizable” drink program like Starbucks has done. Interesting question and you may find my response interesting …   ***********************************   ""Kerry"" … I think the whole drink customization capability at Starbucks came about through the evolution of its business and not from an act of marketing creation.   Back when the Starbucks menu was limited (just whole milk, two flavor syrups, no caramel, no Frappuccino, etc), customers had limited ways to customize their SBUX coffee.     But coffee has always been a customizable beverage.  Everyone has their own ritual to concocting the perfect cup for them.  Back in the day, it was adding a specific number of sugar lumps.     Today, it's evolved considerably with customers having a variety of options, to customization today being able to add 1 pack Equal, 1 pack Sweet-N-Low, 1 pump Hazelnut, etc to any coffee drink at Starbucks.   Starbucks promoted drink customization in the 80s & 90s through its Baristas and not through customer-facing marketing signage.  Baristas told customers how they liked to customize their Latte and their Brewed Coffee and because customers valued the opinions of Starbucks Baristas, they ended up customizing their drinks in similar fashion.    From there, the customization brand aspect of Starbucks has evolved to the extent that I've heard there are up to 50,000 ways a Starbucks drink can be customized.  (I've also heard that customization number to closer to 20,000.  Either way, it’s a considerable number.)   Another aspect to consider is how this customization evolved from the Starbucks drink language.  (You know what I am talking about—Half-Caf, Double Tall, Non-Fat, No Foam Latte.  That’s the Starbucks drink language.)  Starbucks created its drink language to help make drink preparation more uniform resulting in faster delivery and greater consistency from store-to-store.  Once that language was codified and Starbucks Baristas had a systematic way to craft coffee drinks, it became apparent to customers that they could customize a beverage in a seemingly infinite number of ways.   This was all a natural business evolution process spurred on by  doing  rather than  saying .    To clarify this point, think back to 2004 when Starbucks ran an in-store and out-of-store promotion called CUSTOMIZE YOUR CUP.  A fancy booklet was produced explaining how drinks can be customized and some out-of-store print ads ran.  This full-on marketing approach didn't really work too well because it felt contrived and not a natural by-product of the Starbucks Experience.   Customers laughed at the booklet  thinking it treated them as being stupid , that (a) they didn't know you could customize a beverage and (b) here's Starbucks getting pedantic by showing how to customize a beverage using elementary language.  There's something to be said for having a ""hidden menu"" and allowing customers to ""hijack"" the brand without superficial prodding.  ( Just ask In-N-Out .)   As for a quick service restaurant seeking to emulate Starbucks success in crafting a customized drink culture with customers… my advice is to first get employees jazzed about customizing drinks.  That excitement from employees should get passed onto to customers——like it did at Starbucks.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Back in the day, people used to line up outside the doors of Starbucks locations in the Pacific Northwest so they could be one of the first folks to enjoy Christmas Blend on the morning it went on sale.  At least that’s the company campfire story that still gets passed around today.     I’m not sure the  anticipation  for Christmas Blend exists today like it did back in the day.  Nevertheless, when Starbucks starts serving Christmas Blend it still signals the start of the Holiday season for many people, including me.       As a former long-time Starbucks marketer, I’m well-versed in the lore of Christmas Blend.  I’ve even managed to save a few old school marketing materials sharing the lore of Christmas.  One of my favorite old-school Starbucks Christmas Blend marketing materials is this advertisement from the early 90s.

""     ***********************************    Patty, you bring a valid point.    The pastries Starbucks serves are not as good as the coffee it serves.    When I was at Starbucks, the mantra was, “Coffee is the core, but food is the opportunity.”    Improving its food offerings is something Starbucks has been trying to do for a long time.    It seems like now the company is more concerned with delivering consistency with its pastries from a store in California to a store in Connecticut than it is in delivering the best quality pastry.    There are many reasons for this.   As Starbucks gets bigger and bigger, they are “nationalizing” more and more of their pastry offerings.    You’ll find that many of the pastries served at Starbucks locations are of the “thaw and serve” variety.    An increasing number of pasties are air-shipped to Starbucks frozen and then are thawed at the store before being placed in the pastry counter.   Artisan and local bakeries have trouble meeting the day-in-day-out increasing demands of supplying Starbucks with fresh pastries. With Starbucks fast-paced growth, they have created a monster that artisan bakeries have difficulty feeding.   Starbucks would no doubt increase sales if they were able to make their pastry offerings more than merely satisfactory. However, as mentioned earlier, beverage is boss at Starbucks.  Since the company excels at preparing and selling coffee beverages, it is easier for Starbucks to impact sales by introducing new, higher-prices beverages than to overhaul its food program.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me . My answer to your question might appear in a future Starbucks Mailbag posting.                    Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #4                         Oct. 5,  2006  | In the comments section of  Tribal Truth #33, Judy asked me  …  ""Can you tell me what it means to create an employee experience? How do the best companies ensure that the employee experience is aligned to the customer experience?""   ***********************************    [My answer]   Whoa … that’s a loaded question Judy. Simplistically speaking, creating meaningful employee experiences revolves around making the company something employees can believe in ( Tribal Truth #32 ). It’s also about a company realizing that its products do not make great brands but rather, its people make brands great ( Tribal Truth #37 ).    The best companies, namely those listed as one of  Fortune Magazine’s ""100 Best Companies to Work for in America ,""  spend just as much time marketing to its employees as it does to its customers. In other words, these companies realize that happy, knowledgeable employees will usually translate into happy, knowledgeable customers.     For example …  The Container Store  is a Dallas-based privately held company specializing in selling boxes, bins, and everything in-between to help consumers organize all their stuff. They have been highly successful with sales in 2005 topping $425 million with just 37 locations in 12 states.    New Container Store employees are given more than 240 hours of training in their first year compared with the industry standard of 7 hours of training per new employee. Employees are paid two-to-three times more than the industry average. And employees are given a generous 40% discount for anything purchased at the Container Store. The company is renowned by retailers and customers as delivering great customer experiences which helps to explain why the company is so successful.   With its focus on making the employee experience matter ( Tribal Truth #33 ), The Container Store astonishes its employees who in turn, astonish its customers with great customer service.    Given the Container Store example, one sure-fire way to ensure the employee experience is aligned with the customer experience is to treat employees like you would want employees to treat customers. Sounds simple. But if it was so simple, more companies would be doing it … right?   ***********************************   If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Jeremy  (Boise, ID) emailed me a question about the iconic Starbucks paper cups …  “I love the regular logo on the white cup. During the  Holiday  season, they change the design of the cups. Does the design change really boost sales that much?”   ***********************************    [My answer]   Hmm … interesting question Jeremy.    To mark the Holiday season, Starbucks cups change from its regular white logo’d look to a festive red color design.    Does this cup design change boost sales?    I’m not sure Starbucks has data which isolates the Holiday cup design as being a factor in boosting sales during the Holidays.    Sales at Starbucks always increase during the Holidays for a variety of reasons including … customers buy more merchandise at this time because of the gift buying season, six weeks of social shopping outings with friends and family seems to always include drinking coffee, wintry weather always drives more hot coffee beverages purchases, etc.   As you can tell, it is tough to isolate the red Holiday cup design from all the other factors helping to increase sales during this time.    By the way, Starbucks will generate almost 25% of its yearly sales during the six-week long Holiday shopping season with many Starbucks stores doubling their average weekly sales during these six weeks.   What the red cup does is very  Pavlovian  in that it triggers something with Starbucks customers to recognize it is the Holiday season. As crazy as it sounds … customers seem to await the red Holiday cup as it helps to put them in the “Christmas Spirit.”    It also, and maybe more importantly, puts in-store employees (Baristas) in more of a Holiday mood.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  No Comments »                     Starbucks Mailbag #2                         Sept. 16, 2006  | This is the second installment of the “Starbucks Mailbag” where I give a  former  insider's perspective on questions I’ve received about Starbucks strategies and decisions.   Eddy  emailed me with this double-barreled question …  “Why does Starbucks not scoop beans and instead sells pre-bagged coffee ?""   ***********************************     [My answer]  Eddy, the decision to not scoop beans and instead use primarily use pre-packaged coffee comes down to issues of efficiency and quality.     Up until the late 90s, Starbucks scooped every bag of beans sold.    But scooping, weighing, and bagging beans takes time—time that most Starbucks customers do not appreciate.    Starbucks customers would rather pick-up a pre-bagged pound of coffee than wait the time it takes a Barista to do it.    As you can surmise, these efficiency gains result in greater financial/profitability for the company because it takes less store-level employee labor to bag beans.   To an extent, these efficiency gains are offset by the loss of aroma and theater.    Starbucks stores today do not smell like Starbucks stores did in the past.    Since very little scooping of beans takes place, stores do not have as strong of a coffee aroma as they used to.    Plus, there is very little theater in a customer plucking a bag of beans off a floor display.    Part of the “Starbucks Experience” used to be the theater of having a Barista scoop, weigh, bag, and place a stamp on each bag of coffee sold.    That theater doesn’t happen much these days at Starbucks.   Selling pre-packaged coffee is also a quality issue.    The quality of the pre-packaged coffee is improved in many ways because there is a one-way value in each pre-packaged bag which releases gasses that roasted beans give off.    Simply put, this one-way valve (known as a “Flavorlock” valve) allows coffee beans to not get stale.  Sure, there is a more complicated explanation but that begins to explain it.   ***********************************    If you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me .

In TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE, I share many of my thoughts from experiencing the strategies devised and the decisions made firsthand. However, I couldn’t share every thought because the book would have become too choppy and too wayward.   Hmm … choppy and wayward?    That’ll make for great Tribal Knowledge blog fodder, eh?     So, every month from here on out, I’ll be answering some of the Starbucks-related questions I’ve been asked over the years.    And if you have a burning Starbucks-related question but never knew who to ask,  use the contact form and ask me . My answer to your question might appear in a future Starbucks Mailbag posting.   ***********************************    Our first question comes from  Blythe Christopher de Orive .    Bkyth asks,  ""Who came up with the brilliant idea of marketing CDs at the counter? Was it synergy between the record companies and Starbucks or can you trace it to one individual?""   ***********************************   [My answer]  Not sure this can be traced to one specific individual … more like a trial/error process than anything else. Starbucks has tried to sell many different things at the counter from finger puppets to hard candy to granola-like bars. The real estate space at the main POS (point of sale) is extremely political (and highly profitable) with lots of discussion behind the scenes at Starbucks.      The decision to sell CDs at the POS most likely came about because (a) CDs sell well as an “impulse buy” and (b) the increased visibility of music CDs at the POS helps to promote Starbucks as a player in the music business.   But another reason to consider is “shrinkage.”    No, I’m not talking about  George Costanza shrinkage  but rather, the type of shrinkage where inventory shrinks due to theft from customers or employees. Starbucks loses a lot of CDs to theft because they lack security screeners and because they merchandise CDs on racks in out-of-sight corners in its stores. Think about it, every music retailer has security screeners to reduce theft.    Not Starbucks.    Since its stores are heavily trafficked, it’s pretty easy to swipe CDs without a Starbucks barista (employee) noticing.   However, when you place CDs at the main POS where a barista is deployed it becomes more difficult to steal a CD.      Next time you see a used CD store located near a Starbucks, riffle through their CD compilations section.    Chances are very high you’ll notice many Starbucks/Hear Music CDs still in pristine shrinkwrap condition.    And know you know the rest of the story.    (Wait, I can’t use that line.    Someone else has dibs on it.    Drats.)                Posted in      Notes & Updates    |  Comments (2) »                     Notes & Updates                         AUGUST 2006  | For a company that has accomplished so much, it’s surprising how little the business world really knows how Starbucks found prosperity from selling a commodity. That’s because much of this company’s sage advice and weathered truths exist solely in the hearts and minds of longtime Starbucks partners (employees).    Starbucks Tribal Knowledge is an innate language that has never been written, only spoken, and then, only within the Starbucks tribe.     It’s a pithy quote by a respected Starbucks executive. It’s a mantra used by Starbucks project teams to bring forth passionate followership. It’s emotionally intense advice from old-school Starbucks partners. It’s “a-ha moments” from successful (and failed) projects. It’s poignant. It’s thought-provoking. It’s actionable. It’s what built Starbucks the business and Starbucks the brand.   It’s time for those outside the Starbucks tribe to have access to this knowledge.     As a former, long-time Starbucks marketer, it is my hope more businesses follow the endearing and enduring principles the Starbucks business was built upon.    That’s exactly why I wrote TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE and why this companion website exists.    In this companion website, you can  PREVIEW  the book by reading a sample chapter and familiarize yourself with all the  TRIBAL TRUTHS  discussed in the book.    Plus, I’ve included other goodies in the  EXTRAS & LINKS  section.

The following letter is a typical                  reponse to those concerns sent by Starbucks to a concerned consumer                  in London.                 Thank-you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company.                 Thank-you for your inquiry regarding genetic modification of                  Starbucks foods. We recognize that this issue is of increasing                  concern to our customers. At Starbucks we have a long standing                  commitment to address the social and environmental effects of                  our business  (for                  the real truth, click here)  and are actively                  seeking to understand the agricultural issues related to our foods                  and beverages.                 Beginning with our coffee, our research has shown that all of                  our coffee beans are free from genetic modification  (so                  far this is true, but Starbucks has not agreed to avoid GE coffee                  once it's on the market.   To learn                  more of the truth, click here) . Also, to the                  best of our knowledge, none of our products contain genetically                  modified ingredients.
