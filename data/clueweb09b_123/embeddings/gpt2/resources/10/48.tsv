Codename: 'Bonnie' REV.F1 ATARI Corp. 1991   ATARI history     ATARI Corp.  was founded by Nolan Bushnell in 1972, where ' ATARI ' is  japanese  for "" I'm going to win! "" (deriving from the traditional board game ' Go! '). First plans, in which the company was to be called  'Syzygy'  (an astronomical term), fortunately failed because of copyright-reasons - still, the term  ' Syzygy engineered '  can be found on some early hardware serial number stickers.  Bushnell, however, needed a company to sell the legendary  Pong -videogame (in arcade-, later home-versions), which made  ATARI  the leading force of the videogame-market these days; also legendary became the later games, like  Breakout  (developed by  Steve Jobs , who worked for Bushnell these days!) and  Asteroids  (1979, launched to oppose  Taito 's  Space Invaders ). In  1977  the  VCS 2600  was introduced, a best-selling videogame-system, after  Nolan Bushnell  had sold  ATARI  to  Warner Bros.  in  1976  - without  Warner 's financial support,  ATARI  would probably have gone bankrupt because of the expensive  VCS development process .  Bushnell  remained CEO and then finally left  ATARI  in  1978 .  In the following years of the  videogame-boom ,  ATARI  led the competition, with both home- and arcade systems. But then, at the end of  1982  (the year in which  TIME  declared the personal computer 'Machine of the year', ironically), the videogame-market crashed from one day to another - the so-called ' videogame shakeout ' had begun. Even worse since  ATARI  had just launched the  ATARI 5200  SuperSystem , which was to become the  2600 's successor... Luckily,  ATARI  had already found their role in the upcoming  8 bit  computer-market by that time, with famous machines like the  ATARI 400/800  and their successors  1200XL ,  600XL  and  800XL . Nevertheless, they later tried to resurrect the  2600  again, with the  VCS 7800   PRO System ,   but failed - mainly because of  Nintendo 's technologically advanced  Entertainment System . In  1984  then,  ATARI  was split: computer- and videogame-divisions were sold to  Jack Tramiel  (called ' ATARI Technology Corp. ' from then on), the arcade-section was sold to  Namco  (forming ' ATARI Games Corp. ', see logo above).    With the  ATARI Technology Corp. ,  Tramiel  wanted to rival  Commodore  - a company he had founded himself, and which he had left because of some disputes with management. After failing to overtake  Amiga Inc.  (to prevent  CBM  from buying it),  ATARI  had to mothball the planned  1850XL  and a  high-end game-console  (both based on the  Amiga -chipset they had planned to license). So in  1985  they introduced the  ST-series  (' S ixteen- T hirtytwo', because of their 16/32 bit  Motorola 68000  CPU), finally entering the  16 bit-market  and following  Apple 's  Lisa  and  Macintosh  in many ways (that's why many people called it the ' Jackintosh '...). Although it didn't sell as good as it's opponent, the  Amiga  did, it was a milestone in computer technology as well. It was cheap, had built-in MIDI and a high-res black-and-white monitor with 70Hz and so was often seen in sound-recording studios or offices. There was even a  ST-based laptop  called ' STacy ', and a notebook ( ST-book ). Also, together with the first  ST s, the  XL-series  was relaunched as  XE-series  ( 130XE ,  800XE ,  65XE  and  XE SYSTEM ),  in similar designed cases - considered a step backwards by most people, since the 8 bit market was already dying, these machines didn't sell as well as their ancestors did. The  ST-series , however, sold well, but as mentioned earlier, couldn't rival the  Amiga 's multimedia capabilities. Additionally,  Commodore  had already released much faster machines with  68020  and  68030  CPUs. That's why  ATARI  decided to improve the  ST-design ; the  ATARI TT  was a true 32 bit machine built around a  68030  CPU (' T hirtytwo- T hirtytwo'), but with only slightly improved graphics and not fully  ST -compatible. The  ST E -series  ('ST enhanced') was more compatible and featured  4096 colors  and  PCM-sound . Both sold quite well, but due to the lack of software making use of their capabilities, didn't become as successful as the  ST-series  was.  Finally, after having launched  the first  64 bit  videogame  (the  Jaguar ) and the  FALCON 030  (aka  SPARROW /  FX-1  -  a fantastic, new ST-design based on a  68030 CPU  and  DSP ), the company was forced to give up due to financial problems...   Also worth mentioning  is that  ATARI  had, like  Commodore , developed many machines that were interesting but have never been released ( prototypes ); among them were improved versions of the VCS (e.g.  VCS 2700 ), XL-protoypes ( 1400XL ,  XLD -series) and many ST-variants (a  130ST  with only 128K RAM, a  1040STE+  with additional onboard 80286,  EST s  ('enhanced ST')  with new BLiTTER and Shifter, a  FALCON 040  etc).

clueweb09-en0011-94-17715	"         Atari 400       Announced: December 1978   Released: November 1979   Price: US $549.95   CPU: MOS 6502,1.8MHz    RAM: 8K base, 48K max   Display: 24 X 40 text   320 x 192 monochrome   160 x 96 with 128 colors   Expansion: 2 internal expansion slots   1 cartridge slot under front cover   Ports: 4 controller ports   TV video output   Storage: external floppy drive   cassette recorder   OS: Atari OS                            The Atari 400 and 800 were both announced in December 1978, though they didn't  actually start shipping until late in 1979.    Designed primarily as a computer for children, the Atari 400 has an ""advanced child-proof design featuring  pressure-sensitive, wipe-clean keyboard"". It has a single cartridge port under the front cover.                    The Atari 400 boots-up into ""Notepad"", the only built-in program. Any other programs will have to run  from cassette or cartridge - this includes BASIC, or any other programming language.   Game cartridges can be inserted into the cartridge slot in front, starting instantly with no fuss.   Many games were clones of actual video arcade hits, others were original or copies of other popular (or not)  computer games of the 80's.         Most of the Atari 400 circuitry is under a solid metal shield, to keep the radio emissions under the legal limit.   The two internal expansion slots are also under this cover, which can only be accessed by disassembling  the entire console.   Read more about the 400's big sister, the  Atari 800  for more fun and details.   Both the Atari 400 and 800 were designed by a team which included Jay Miner, who later went on to help design  the Commodore  Amiga 1000 .

() is a majority owned subsidiary of  Infogrames Entertainment SA  (IESA), encompassing its  North America n operations. Atari develops, publishes and distributes games for all major  video game console s, as well as for the  personal computer , and is currently one of the largest third-party publishers of  video games  in the  United States .  The company that currently bears the Atari name was founded in 1993 under the name  GT Interactive . GT Interactive was acquired by IESA in 1999 and renamed  Infogrames, Inc.  Infogrames acquired the Atari brand name from its purchase of  Hasbro Interactive , which in turn had acquired it from  JTS Corporation , which the original Atari had merged with in 1996. Infogrames, Inc. intermittently used the Atari name as a  brand name  for selected titles before IESA officially changed the U.S. subsidiary's name to Atari, Inc. in 2003.  The original Atari was a pioneer in  arcade game s, home  video game console s, and  personal computer s, and its dominance in those areas made it  the  major force in the  computer  entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. The brand has also been used at various times by  Atari Games , a separate company split off in 1984.  History   Since the early days of coin operated machines, Atari has been responsible for home consoles such as the  Atari 2600  (VCS); produced a series of  eight-bit computers  (Atari 400 & 800); taken part in the 16 bit computer revolution with the  Atari ST ; made the revolutionary (for its time) 64-bit  Atari Jaguar ; and released a hand held video game console, the  Atari Lynx .  The 1970s: The rise of a video game empire    In 1970  Nolan Bushnell  saw  Spacewar!  for the first time at the  University of Utah . Deciding there was commercial potential in a coin-op version, he hand-wired a custom computer capable of playing it on a black and white  television  in a single-player mode where the player shot at two orbiting  UFO s. The resulting game,  Computer Space , was released by an existing coin-op game company,  Nutting Associates .  Computer Space did not fare well commercially when it was placed in Nutting's customary market, bars. Feeling that the game was simply too complex for the average (potentially drunk) customer, Bushnell started looking for new ideas. In 1971 he saw a demonstration of the  Magnavox Odyssey , and quickly produced an arcade version,  PONG . After negotiations with Nutting to release PONG through them broke down, Bushnell and his partner Ted Dabney decided to start their own company.   They originally wanted to call the company  Syzygy , an astronomical term. However, as there already existed at least one company with that name (Bushnell stated in an official interview that it was a candle company), Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  Atari , a term that means that a  stone  or group of stones is in danger of being taken by one's opponent. Also, the name ""Atari"" is arguably more memorable than ""Syzygy"" in terms of spelling and pronunciation for most markets. Atari was incorporated in 1972. PONG went on to be a massive hit, only more so in  video game console  form, far better known than the Odyssey that spawned it.  In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by long-time partner Joe Keenan, to circumvent pinball distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.  In 1975 Bushnell started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. Development took place at an offshoot engineering lab, who initially had serious difficulties trying to produce such a machine. However, in early 1976 the now-famous  MOS Technology 6502  was released, and for the first time the team had a  CPU  with both the high-performance and low-cost needed to meet their needs. The result was the  Atari 2600 , which is one of the most successful consoles in history.  Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. Looking for outside investors, in 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28–$32 million, using part of the money to buy the Folgers Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.  A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could given that time frame. By the middle of the effort's time-frame the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some level of success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.  While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.  The 1980s: Hurdles ahead  Although the 2600 had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, it experienced its first stiff competition in 1980 from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, because of its market superiority, and because of Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.  However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.   In 1982, Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. (It is rumored that in 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders from distributors,  Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges  (the bulk of them consisting of those same two titles, Pac-Man and E.T.) in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .)  Also in 1982, Atari settled a court case with  Activision , a competing game developer primarily composed of disgruntled Atari ex-employees, officially opening the 2600 to third-party development. The market quickly became saturated, depressing prices further.  In December of 1982, Atari executives  Ray Kassar  and  Dennis Groth  were investigated for allegations of insider trading (later found to be false).   Larry Emmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research and development of the small group of talented engineers in Grass Valley, California, who had designed the 2600 and home computers.   The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation follow up to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations.   Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except  Japan ; that market belonged to  Nintendo , which had released their first game console, the  Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the  NES ) in 1983. The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal: Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was in the works, and the two companies tentatively decided to sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer  CES . Unfortunately, at that same show  Coleco  was showcasing their new  Adam computer , and the display unit was running Nintendo's  Donkey Kong . Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  was furious, as Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers, and he accused Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo, in turn, tore into Coleco, who only owned the console rights to the game. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal. Although Nintendo were ultimately forced to market the Famicom themselves (as the NES), they managed to make a major success of the system without Atari's involvement (and their profit sharing).  In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corporation  for $240 million in stocks under the new company. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games  and eventually selling it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .    Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  used the remaining stock of game console inventory to keep the company afloat while they finished development of their 16-bit computer system, the  Atari ST . In 1985 they released their update to the 8-bit computer line, the Atari XE series, as well as the 16-bit  Atari ST  line. Then, in 1986, Atari launched two consoles designed under the Warner Atari - Atari 2600jr and the  Atari 7800  console (which saw limited release in 1984). Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved very successful (but mostly in Europe, not the U.S.), ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in  MIDI  ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the  Commodore Amiga , outsold it 3 to 2. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive  IBM PC compatible s as well as an MS-DOS compatible palm computer called the Atari Portfolio.  In 1989, Atari also released the  Atari Lynx , a handheld console with color graphics, to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season. As a result, the Lynx lost market share to Nintendo's  Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  The 1990s: Decline  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In 1993, Atari released its last console, the  Jaguar . After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. It was not nearly as powerful as  Sony Computer Entertainment's   PlayStation  or  Sega's   Saturn  and lacked the extensive third party support its Japanese competitors had easily secured for their consoles.  By 1996, a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with  JTS Inc. ,a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, to form JTS Corp. Atari's role in the new company largely became a holder for the Atari properties and minor support, consequently the name largely disappeared from the market.   Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the 1970s and 1980s, and many of the retro-gaming conventions (such as World Of Atari,  Classic Gaming Expo , Philly Classic, and the Midwest Gaming Classic), focus largely on Atari. There are also websites dedicated to the release of new products for the original Atari consoles and computers, such as  AtariAge .  In March 1998, JTS sold the Atari name and assets to Hasbro Interactive for $5 million—less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the  brand  and  intellectual property , which now fell under the Atari Interactive division of Hasbro Interactive. The brand name changed hands again in December 2000, when French software publisher  Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.  In the meantime,  Atari Games  was bought out by its employees in 1986, who also founded  Tengen  to bring their arcade games in to the home. The new  Time-Warner  eventually started gaining more and more shares in the company until they eventually owned the company completely again by 1994. At that point Atari Games ceased to exist and became part of Time-Warner Interactive. By 1996, Time-Warner sold TWI to  WMS Industries, Inc. , owner of  Midway  at the time. WMS brought the properties under Midway (which it now renamed Midway Games Inc.), and re-instated the  Atari Games  name. In 1998, Midway was sold to its shareholders and spun off as a separate company. Over 1999-2000, Midway held closed door proceedings with Hasbro which ultimately led to Atari Games being renamed Midway Games West. Midway left the arcade industry in 2001, and shut down Midway Games West in 2003 - closing the chapter on what was left of the original Atari arcade division.  The 2000s: Revival and re-release of Atari classics  In October 2001,  Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On  May 7 ,  2003 , Infogrames officially reorganized its US subsidiary as a separate entity known as  Atari, Inc. . It named its European operations to Atari Europe, and kept the main holdings company as Infogrames Entertainment.     In 2002,  Jakks Pacific , a toy making company, released a  plug-and-play  video game console called the Atari 10-in-1 TV Game, believed by many to arouse interest in the concept of self-contained entertainment devices that did not require separate hardware to operate. It was battery-operated and shaped similarly to an Atari 2600 joystick, and included A/V ports. In 2004, the same company created a device called Atari Paddle Games, in the shape of one of the 2600's ""paddle"" controllers with appropriate titles included. However, as stated, neither of the games was directly released by Atari.  The same year that the Paddle Games were released, Atari released a TV game of their own which they called the  Atari Flashback  Console. The device they produced looked like a minute version of the Atari 7800 console originally released in 1984, 20 years previously. The two controllers were small as well, having a joystick and two red buttons on each side. Twenty titles were built into the system. Unlike most plug-and-plays, the Flashback was not powered by batteries, but an (included) AC adaptor instead. The Flashback did fairly well in sales; however, many Atari fans felt disappointed. Many people felt that the device itself was far too small, and the joysticks felt very dissimilar to those of the 7800. Since the games were all recreated on hardware more closely resembling the  Nintendo Entertainment System  than the 7800, some of the aspects of certain games concerning the sound, graphics, or gameplay were either changed or omitted. Overall, many enthusiasts believed that the Flashback did not capture the true Atari experience.  Because of popular demand, Atari released a new version of the Flashback console, titled  Atari Flashback 2 , in August 2005.  Also, in late October 2005, Atari released one of two collections of its classic arcade games only for the Nokia N-Gage console, titled Atari Masterpieces. Atari Masterpieces Volume I includes classic arcade games: Asteroids, Battlezone, Black Widow, Millipede, Missile Command, Red Baron, Lunar Lander and Super Breakout, and features an exclusive interview with Nolan Bushnell. Atari Masterpieces Volume II is scheduled to be released in March 2006.  On May 5th, 2006, Atari and Hasbro stopped Bioware and DLA from further development of premium modules and publishing near-completed premium modules for Neverwinter Nights. No reason was stated, but it was likely in anticipation of the upcoming sequel, Neverwinter Nights 2, which would lack features from these modules.  Atari's New Titles and Direction  Recently, Atari's top-selling titles have been the  Dragon Ball Z  games based on the popular anime license from  Toei Animation  in  Japan . These include the   Budokai  series of games for next-generation console systems and the   The Legacy of Goku  series of games for the Game Boy Advance. These games have topped the  best-seller charts  for numerous console platforms since the release of Atari's first  Dragon Ball Z  game,   The Legacy of Goku  in 2002, which was the first  Dragon Ball  game to be made by an American company,  Webfoot Technologies , and is one of the  best-selling  Game Boy Advance games of all time (#16). The best selling  Budokai  series is developed in Japan by  Dimps  and includes   Budokai ,   Budokai 2 ,   Budokai 3  and   Budokai Tenkaichi . Following the success of the Budokai and Legacy of Goku series, Atari has released numerous other Dragon Ball titles including   Supersonic Warriors ,   Super Sonic Warriors 2 ,   Sagas ,   Transformation  and   Final Bout .  Atari also released a series of games based on the smash-hit  The Matrix  movie trilogy including  Enter the Matrix  and   Path of Neo . These titles represent some of the most expensive video games ever developed.  Enter the Matrix , which was developed by  Shiny Entertainment , sold 1.38 million units for the Sony  PlayStation 2  and 1 million units for the  Nintendo GameCube , making it one of the  best selling computer and video games .  Other currently popular titles for Atari include the  RollerCoaster Tycoon  and  Driver  series.

The   Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation followup to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations. Some time during the   1980s , it is rumored Atari buried millions of unsold E.T. game cartridges in a   New Mexico    desert    landfill .  Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market. They were the number one console maker in every market except   Japan . That market belonged to   Nintendo , who had released their first game console, the   Famicom  (known to the rest of the world as the   NES ) in   1983 . The system took Japan by storm, and Nintendo began to look to other markets. They approached Atari and offered a licensing deal - Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was all but done, and the two companies decided to formally sign the agreement at the 1983 Summer CES. Unfortunately, at that same show   Coleco  was showing their new Adam computer, and the display unit was running   Donkey Kong . But Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers. Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  had a fit, accusing Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo in turn tore into Coleco. In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch.   These problems were followed by the infamous   video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20 and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division. As for Nintendo, Atari could no longer afford the Famicom deal, and eventually Nintendo would be forced to go it alone.  In July   1984 , Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to   Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor   Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corp.  for $240 million. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name   Atari Games .  Under Tramiel's ownership,  Atari Corp.  abandoned the game console market to concentrate on aggressively priced home computers, releasing the 8-bit Atari XE series and the 16-bit   Atari ST  line in   1985 . Then, in   1986 , Atari re-released the Atari 2600 and released its previously cancelled Atari 7800 console.  Atari rebounded, producing a $25 million profit that year. The Atari ST line proved moderately successful, ultimately selling more than 4 million units. It was especially popular among musicians, as it had built in MIDI ports. Still, its closest competitor in the marketplace, the   Amiga , outsold it 1.5 to 1. Atari eventually released a line of inexpensive   IBM PC compatible s as well.  Atari also released Atari Lynx, a handheld console with color graphics, in   1989  to critical acclaim. However, a shortage of parts kept the system from being released nationwide for the 1989 Christmas season and as a result, the Lynx lost marketshare to Nintendo's   Game Boy , which had only a black and white display but was widely available. Also in 1989, Atari Corp. sued Nintendo for $250 million, alleging it had an illegal monopoly. Atari lost.  As the fortunes of Atari's ST and PC compatible computers faded, consoles and software again became the company's main focus. In   1993 , Atari released its last console, the Jaguar. After a period of initial success, it, too, failed to meet expectations. Although it was more powerful than competing consoles from the likes of   Sony  and   Sega  in some ways, it was also more expensive and more difficult to program. Atari's competitors offered larger software libraries and advertised much more heavily.  By   1996 , a series of successful lawsuits followed by profitable investments had left Atari with millions of dollars in the bank, but the failure of the Lynx and Jaguar left Atari without any products to sell. In addition, Tramiel and his family wanted out. The result was a rapid succession of changes in ownership. In July 1996, Atari merged with   JTS Corporation , a short-lived maker of hard disk drives, and the Atari name largely disappeared from the market.   Although the original Atari ceased to exist, a large amount of underground development remains for Atari's game systems and computers of the   1970s  and   1980s , and much of the  Classic Gaming Expo 's attention, which has existed since   1997 , focuses on Atari.  In March   1998 , JTS sold the Atari name and assets to   Hasbro Interactive  for $5 million, less than a fifth of what Warner Communications had paid 22 years earlier. This transaction primarily involved the   brand  and   intellectual property ; the development headquarters and design teams during this time were bought by   Midway . The brand name changed hands again in December   2000  when French software publisher   Infogrames  took over Hasbro Interactive.  In October   2001 ,   Infogrames  announced that it was ""reinventing"" the Atari brand with the launch of three new games. On   May 7 ,   2003 , Infogrames officially changed its name to  Atari, Inc.

Atari ST The Atari ST was a home/ personal computer system released by Atari in 1985.

Other theories say that ST really stood for Atari For the concept in the game of go, see Atari (go term). Atari Inc. is now the name of a French-owned (ex. Infogrames) game software company. The original company Atari was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and personal computers, and it Atari 2600 The Atari 2600 released in 1977, was the first successful video game console to use plug-in cartridges instead of having one or more games built in.

Primarily responsible for the formation of the video arcade and modern video game industries, the company was closed and its assets split in 1984 as a direct result of the  North American video game crash of 1983 .

Deciding there was commercial potential in a coin-op version, several years later he and  Ted Dabney  worked on a hand-wired custom computer capable of playing it on a black and white  television  in a single-player mode where the player shot at two orbiting  UFOs . The resulting game,  Computer Space , was released by an existing coin-op game company,  Nutting Associates .   Computer Space  did not fare well commercially when it was placed in Nutting's customary market, bars. Feeling that the game was simply too complex for the average customer, Bushnell started looking for new ideas. [ 1 ]          The original Atari upright cabinet       Bushnell and Ted Dabney left Nutting to form their own engineering firm,  Syzygy Engineering , [ 2 ]  and soon hired  Al Alcorn  as their first design engineer. Initially wanting to start Syzygy off with a driving game, Bushnell had concerns that it might be too complicated for the young Alcorn's first game. [ 1 ]  In May 1972, Nolan had seen a demonstration of the  Magnavox Odyssey , which included a tennis game. According to Alcorn, Nolan decided to have him produce an arcade version of the Odyssey's Tennis game, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  which would go on to be named  Pong . Atari later had to pay Magnavox a licensing fee after the latter sued Atari because of this.  [ 6 ] [ 7 ]   When they went to incorporate their firm that June, they soon found that  Syzygy  (an astronomical term) already existed in California. Bushnell wrote down several words from the game  Go , eventually choosing  atari , a term that in the context of the game means a state where a  stone  or group of stones is imminently in danger of being taken by one's opponent. Atari was incorporated in the state of California on June 27th, 1972. [ 8 ]   By November 1972, the first  Pong  was completed. It consisted of a black and white television from  Walgreens , the special game hardware, and a coin mechanism from a laundromat on the side which featured a milk carton inside to catch coins. Placed in a  Sunnyvale  tavern by the name of Andy Capp's to test its viability, it took only one day to realize they had a hit:   ""Seven quarters later they were having extended volleys, and the constant pong noise was attracting the curiosity of others at the bar. Before closing, everybody in the bar had played the game. The next day people were lined up outside Andy Capp's at 10 A.M. to play Pong. Around ten o'clock that night, the game suddenly died."" [ 9 ]   When they arrived the next morning to fix the machine, they were met by a lineup of people waiting for the bar to open so they could play the game. On examination, the problem turned out to be mundane; the coin collector was filled to overflowing with quarters, and when customers tried to jam them in anyway, the mechanism shorted out.   After talks to release Pong through Nutting and several other companies broke down, Bushnell and his partner Ted Dabney decided to release Pong on their own, [ 1 ]  and Atari Inc. was established as a coin-op design and production company.          The third version of the Atari  Video Computer System  sold from 1980 to 1981       In 1973, Atari secretly spawned a ""competitor"" called  Kee Games , headed by Nolan's next door neighbor Joe Keenan, to circumvent  pinball  distributors' insistence on exclusive distribution deals; both Atari and Kee could market (virtually) the same game to different distributors, with each getting an ""exclusive"" deal. Though Kee's relationship to Atari was discovered in 1974, Joe Keenan did such a good job managing the subsidiary that he was promoted to president of Atari that same year.   In 1975, Bushnell started an effort to produce a flexible video game console that was capable of playing all four of Atari's then-current games. Development took place at an offshoot engineering lab, which initially had serious difficulties trying to produce such a machine. However, in early 1976 the now-famous  MOS Technology 6502  was released, and for the first time the team had a  CPU  with both the high-performance and low-cost needed to meet their needs. The result was the  Atari 2600 , one of the most successful consoles in history.     [ edit ]   As a subsidiary of Warner Communications   Bushnell knew he had another potential hit on his hands, but bringing the machine to market would be extremely expensive. In 1976 Bushnell sold Atari to  Warner Communications  for an estimated $28 - $32 million, using part of the money to buy the Folgers Mansion. He departed from the division in 1979.          The  Atari 400  was released in 1979       A project to design a successor to the 2600 started as soon as the system shipped. The original development team estimated the 2600 had a lifespan of about three years, and decided to build the most powerful machine they could given that time frame. By the middle of the effort's time-frame the  home computer  revolution was taking off, so the new machines were adapted with the addition of a keyboard and various inputs to produce the  Atari 800 , and its smaller cousin, the 400. Although a variety of issues made them less attractive than the  Apple II  for some users, the new machines had some level of success when they finally became available in quantity in 1980.   While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time.   Although the 2600 had garnered the lion's share of the home video game market, it experienced its first stiff competition in 1980 from  Mattel's   Intellivision , which featured ads touting its superior graphics capabilities relative to the 2600. Still, the 2600 remained the industry standard-bearer, because of its market superiority, and because of Atari featuring (by far) the greatest variety of game titles available.   However, Atari ran into problems in the early 1980s. Its  home computer ,  video game console , and  arcade  divisions operated independently of one another and rarely cooperated. Faced with fierce competition and price wars in the game console and home computer markets, Atari was never able to duplicate the success of the 2600.     In 1982, Atari released disappointing versions of two highly publicized games,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial , causing a pileup of unsold inventory and depressing prices. (In 1983, in response to a massive number of returned orders from distributors,  Atari buried millions of unsold game cartridges  (the bulk of them consisting of those same two titles,  Pac-Man  and  E.T. ) in a  New Mexico   desert   landfill .)   In December 1982, Atari executives  Ray Kassar  and  Dennis Groth  were investigated for allegations of insider trading (later found to be false).   Larry Emmons, employee No.3, retired in 1982. He was head of research and development of the small group of talented engineers in Grass Valley, California, who had designed the 2600 and home computers.   The  Atari 5200  game console, released as a next-generation follow up to the 2600, was based on the Atari 800 computer (but was incompatible with Atari 800 game cartridges), and its sales never met the company's expectations.     These problems were followed by the infamous  video game crash of 1983 , which caused losses that totaled more than $500 million. Warner's stock price slid from $60 to $20, and the company began searching for a buyer for its troubled division.   Still, Atari held a formidable position in the world video game market, and was the number one console maker in every market except  Japan . A Japanese video game company by the name of  Nintendo  was going to be releasing their first programmable video game console, the  Famicom  (later known to the rest of the world as the  NES ), in 1983. Looking to also sell the console in international markets, a partnership with Atari seemed a good match and Nintendo approached Atari to offer a licensing deal whereby Atari would build and sell the system, paying Nintendo a royalty. The deal was in the works throughout 1983, [ 10 ]  and the two companies tentatively decided to sign the agreement at the June, 1983  CES . Unfortunately,  Coleco  was showcasing their new  Adam computer , and the display unit was running Nintendo's  Donkey Kong . Atari CEO  Ray Kassar  was furious, as Atari owned the rights to publish Donkey Kong for computers, and he accused Nintendo of double dealing with the Donkey Kong license. Nintendo, in turn, tore into Coleco, who only owned the console rights to the game.  [2]  Coleco had legal grounds to challenge the claim though since Atari had only purchased the floppy disk rights to the game, while the Adam version was cartridge-based. [ 11 ]  In the coming month, Ray Kassar was forced to leave Atari, and executives involved in the Famicom deal were forced to start over again from scratch and the deal eventually languished. With Atari's further financial problems and the Famicom's runaway Japanese success after its July 16th, 1983 release date, Nintendo decided to go at it alone.     [ edit ]   Splitting of properties   Financial problems continued to grow and Kassar's replacement,  James J. Morgan , had less than a year to try and tackle his predecessor's problems before he too was gone. In July 1984, Warner sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari to  Jack Tramiel , the recently ousted founder of Atari competitor  Commodore International , under the name  Atari Corporation  for $240 million in stocks under the new company. Warner retained the arcade division, continuing it under the name  Atari Games  and eventually selling it to  Namco  in 1985. Warner also sold the fledgling  Ataritel  to  Mitsubishi .

By  Miro Kropacek  on 2009-01-07 Hi people,        so here we are again. Jookie did his best to give you another cool piece of hardware for our beloved Atari beasts and as always, I'm that crazy guy who is up to organize some (big quotes here) business around it ;-)        You can take a look at Jookie's website (http://joo.kie.sk/ultrasatan) for specs, in short:        - ACSI to SD/SDHC/MMC interface solution    - much faster than original SatanDisk (nearly in the limit of ACSI itself!)    - upgradable firmware!    - 2 slots (yeah, behaving like two hard disks!)    - 100% functional cooperation with other ACSI(-to-SCSI) devices: Atari hard disks, Link 9x, ... everything can work all together!    - hot swap functionality! No more reset / power off when changing card! Just like diskette swapping!    - battery backed up realtime clock    - behaves like standard hard disk device    - and the best one: if you don't want to pay, you can build it by yourself -- sources, blueprints etc -- everything is free!        Well, you know the deal. Go to the website (http://mikro.umpc.sk/us_order until I register ultrasatan.atari.org), register, fill out your preliminary interest and wait for payment phase. In case of any problems or questions ask me or Jookie (but we prefer the first option since Jookie don't like to be bothered with all this order 'crap' :)        And the last note -- people, please, behave like normal human beings in our space/time continuum ;-) When we say preorder phase is for two months and payments phase is for another two months, we really mean it. Notice these dates in your mobile phone, calendar, wall, desktop, anywhere but please, don't ask me in October if you still can order our cool hardware... in this way I'd like to ask you for favor -- tell about this HW all your Atari friends, ask them stupid questions like ""did you hear about US project?"" and so on.        You can't imagine how many guys are mailing me MONTHS after manufacturing about our HW projects. It's very unlikely we will made another batch, so take your only chance. I think we have proven we're not some imaginary money rippers, our HW is real and working, people are happy, be happy as well ;-)        OK, that's it, keep fingers crossed!

The web site states that it is now \""supporting a built-in 68000/68030 debugger,\"" and has \""improved compatibility with Windows Vista and recent multi-core 64-bit processors.\""        The code has been reworked to remove Windows dependencies for improved compatibility and portability. The main Gemulator page has not been thoroughly updated, so you really need to read the December 1st No Execute! blog for build instructions if you want to compile your own. Since Darek also tends to mention Gemulator development in passing in his blog, you would need to look at all the blog entries for a complete look at what Darek has been working on.        Gemulator 9 home page:        http://www.emulators.com/gemul8r.htm        December 1, 2008 No Execute! blog entry:        http://www.emulators.com/docs/nx27_nehalem.htm        At the end of this blog entry, Darek announces that he is going to work for Intel.        Best of luck, Darek!   Category: Emulators (WinSTon, Handy ...)   New C99 compiler toolchain available for Atari ! By  Miro Kropacek  on 2009-01-01 Hi everybody,        I'm more than happy to announce the end of our effort to port vbcc/vasm/vlink tools to the TOS platform. Thanks to dedicated work of Frank Wille we've got:        - modern & superb assembler with nearly all devpac directives, i.e. you can finally use your fave assembler under any modern multitasking OS (i.e. FreeMiNT)        - linker with many input and output formats        - fully compliant ANSI C99 compiler that produces hell of optimized code        The whole toolchain was heavily tested on one big project, i.e. we killed quite a many bugs so you should get very well tested product.        As suggested, this toolchain is aimed to be replacement for bloated gcc/gas/ld toolchain which is quite unusable on anything but aranym/ct60. vbcc is lightweight package that runs fine on 4 MB machines, even without FreeMiNT (i.e. under plain TOS!)         Primarily, it's focused to run under FreeMiNT, so I post here little tutorial for the first hello world, in case you're interested in making setup for commandline compiler/assebler under single TOS, feel free to contact me. So, the easiest way to compile ""Hello World"" under FreeMiNT:        1. go to the website (http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vbcc)    2. download vbcc_bin_mint.tar.gz and vbcc_target_m68k-atarimint.zip    3. directories ""bin"" and ""config"" from vbcc_bin_mint.tar.gz copy into /usr/local/vbcc    4. create environment variable called ""VBCC"" with the value of ""/usr/local/vbcc""    5. directory ""targets"" from vbcc_target_m68k-atarimint.zip copy into /usr/local/vbcc    6. tweak access rights for /usr/local/vbcc/targets/m68k-atarimint/include/* and /usr/local/vbcc/targets/m68k-atarimint/lib/* with ""chmod +r+w""        type ""vc -o hello hello.c"" and you should get Atari ST compatible binary! Please refer to the manual of vasm/vbcc/vlink for advanced usage. You can contact me (see my website) for Atari specific things or Frank in case you fall into some trouble.        What? Did I hear you don't need new C compiler since you're happy with your gcc/g++ but still like the idea of having new assembler? Well, no problem! vasm is able to produce fully compliant a.out mint object files, so you can link vasm output with gcc, yeah! Beat this with devpac!        What again? Maybe you would use the vbcc but the gcc offers cross compilation possibility? Well, vbcc as well! You can produce amiga, elf, atari etc binaries on amiga, linux, freemint, windows etc based machines! No complicated configuration, just run ""make TARGET=xxx"" on any machine you want!        Hope you'll enjoy it, I was looking for some decent devpac replacement for years and now I got it!

Well, I grew up with a number of 8-bit computer systems, and the one that I liked the most was the Atari 800. The hardware design seemed the most versatile, and furthermore, it was the hardware predecessor to the Amiga, another one of my favorite systems. One day I got struck with a particularly bad case of nostalgia for it, without access to my real Atari 800. Normally I would have just launched Atari800Win, but for some reason I wanted to write my own emulator instead, since I\'d never done a real one before, and this eventually was the result. Those of you who have followed VirtualDub\'s evolution know I like to do everything myself and in my own way. During one phase of its development, I was told: \""You have the worst case of feature creep I\'ve ever seen.\""        Indeed.        Altirra is not the most polished or complete Atari 800/800XL/130XE emulator by far, but it does run quite a lot of software. The main game I wanted to get running was The Last Starfighter, a.k.a. Star Raiders II, which has cool music and some pretty good graphics -- and turned out to be rather complicated to emulate, due to a bankswitched ROM, a complex display list, and lots of display list interrupts. I have an interest in old computer hardware, and I like to find out how hardware actually works instead of just what it does or what it was supposed to be used for. When writing Altirra, I tried to understand how the original hardware was constructed, and craft the emulator in the same fashion. As a result, it\'s pretty close to cycle exact and supports most of the features of the hardware. It isn\'t quite up to the level of Atari800Win, which I consider the gold standard, but most of the demos and games I\'ve thrown at it work. It even emulates a few things that A8W doesn\'t, such as the SIO disk transfer beeping that I remember a lot from my childhood.        Now, the reason why I was asked to release this emulator? Definitely not for the UI, which sucks. The reason is protected disk support: Altirra can boot from APE (.pro) and VAPI (.atx) disk images, which preserve the original copy protection on software. It even supports SIO (serial input/output) call acceleration and burst I/O with protected disks, which means it can boot them very quickly. At the time, neither format was documented and the patched Atari800Win version with VAPI support could not do accelerated reads, so had I released this earlier, it would have been a first; I believe the VAPI format documentation has since been released, so I guess it\'s a bit late. Still, it was interesting to see what had been done to inhibit copying, such as phantom sectors, CRC errors, and missing sectors, and to see the unmodified games boot. At one point I thought it would be cool to hook up Altirra\'s disk emulator to a serial port and an SIO2PC cable to see if the emulation was good enough to boot a real Atari, but I never got around to it.        You might laugh when I say that I wrote Altirra for educational purposes, but I swear it\'s true. I learned more about the Atari than I ever thought I would, particularly all of the undocumented hardware quirks. Among the goofball issues I had to debug were:    Getting DOS 2.0S to boot with a custom SIO implementation (it replaces serial interrupt vectors and still calls through SIOV)    A program that read from an unused hardware address and then wrote that value to another port to clear interrupts    A game that set the display list interrupt flag on a \""wait for vertical blank\"" byte (which causes the DLI to fire every scanline until VBLANK)    A demo that changed the DLI vector in HBLANK without disabling interrupts and used RTS instead of RTI to exit the handler, leading to crazy control flow    A demo that alternated the vertical scroll register between two illegal values to get a low-overhead, quarter-resolution 9-color display    A demo that displayed eight player sprites on a scanline by doing five mid-scanline register writes with exact cycle timing        I have to say, though, that although the demos were an absolute pain to get working, the things that some of the folks in Europe did in the later years on the Atari were utterly mindblowing, like real-time bump mapping, 3D texture mapping, and digital audio. On a 1.79MHz 6502.        To get the information I needed to write the emulator, I spent a lot of time reading the Atari hardware manual and poring over a gate-level chip schematic of POKEY that had been released to the public by the Atari Historical Society. I also ended up disassembling the Atari 810 disk drive control ROM at one point, because I needed to know the exact rate at which it bit-banged out data over the SIO bus and what head stepping parameters it fed to the floppy drive controller, and analyzing the schematics of the Atari 410 tape drive to replicate how it read tapes (it\'s two bandpass filters and a comparator glued onto the SIO bus).        It\'s doubtful that I\'ll work much more on Altirra, especially considering that I haven\'t really worked on it for months. One of the last things I had been doing was trying to enhance the source-level debugger and cassette support, because I had the idea that it would be possible to write a Guitar Hero or Rock Band clone on the Atari using the tape drive, since it supports an audio track... but of course, that never went far. Working on something like this, you realize quickly that, no, those weren\'t really the good old days... not when load times were measured in minutes and writing anything really cool meant debugging some really hairy 6502 assembly language. Heck, Altirra essentially amounts to the equivalent of a hardware in-circuit emulator (ICE), and it\'s still a pain to track down bugs in a machine language program. So, basically, I\'m throwing it out there just to see if anyone else has the same curiosities as me and finds it interesting. Source is, of course, available under the GPL, and if you\'ve looked at the VirtualDub source, much of it will look familiar as I used the same base libraries. Enjoy!

By  Standa Opichal  on 2008-10-21 JAY Software decided to publish beta (from Oct 2000) of their Blyp application.        Blyp is an ST-Guide .STG/.HYP files viewer that was in development at the end of the last milenium.    Source will hopefully come later in this milenium...        Enjoy the binary!

By  Miro Kropacek  on 2008-10-19 By browsing the net I found the news article about Calamus 1.0 (first released) version being available for free -- for everyone who didn\'t know here\'s the link for download:    http://www.calamus.net/news/2008/080701_1.php    it\'s because of celebration of 17th year of invers software.    It seems they still develop Calamus for Atari, there\'s available version of 2008 release for TOS compatible platform! And you can try Lite version for Atari, too, what is quite interesting for year 2008 :)    From the pessimistic point of view, it\'s maybe because the whole Calamus is still executed as Atari binary under built-in emulator and they don\'t have man-power to rewrite it under any modern framework...

Part of these bookmarks persist since the creation of the WEB site, back in 1996.        The interest with these numerous bookmarks, there\'s more than 600, is to constitute an ATARI uptodate and dedicated search engine of the online scene. It is a service provided by Google Co-op. The base of this engine is a collection composed from time to time. It has now become quite consistent.        This is a WEB 2.0 experience. *ATARI Search Engine* can possibly be integrated by webmasters adding the HTML code.        Have a good ATARI WEB Surfing =) Link:  http://eureka.atari.org/atari.html   Category: 16/32 (ST, STE, Falcon ...)                                     Copyright © 1997-2008 Atari.Org    Atari is registered trademark of  Infogrames           "
