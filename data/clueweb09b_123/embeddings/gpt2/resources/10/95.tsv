Petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock near Canyonlands National Park, south of Moab, south eastern Utah, USA              Rock carving known as ""Meerkatze"" (named by archaeologist Leo Frobenius), rampant lionesses in  Wadi Methkandoush , Mesak Settafet region of Libya.       Petroglyphs  are  images  created by removing part of a  rock  surface by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as ""carving"", ""engraving"", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with  prehistoric  peoples. The word comes from the  Greek  words  petros  meaning ""stone"" and  glyphein  meaning ""to carve"" (it was originally coined in  French  as  ptroglyphe ).   The term  petroglyph  should not be confused with  pictograph , which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of  rock art .  Petroforms , or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different.  Inukshuks  are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.              A petroglyph of a caravan of  bighorn sheep  near  Moab, Utah ,  USA ; a common theme in glyphs from the  desert  southwest       The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late  Upper Paleolithic  boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ( Kamyana Mohyla ). Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of  writing systems , such as  pictographs  and  ideograms , began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with  Western culture  was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except  Antarctica  with highest concentrations in parts of  Africa ,  Scandinavia ,  Siberia , southwestern  North America  and  Australia .     [ edit ]   Interpretation   There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of ""pre- writing "". They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or ""rock gongs"".  [ 1 ]   Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the  Nordic Bronze Age  in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between  tribes , in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The  Siberian inscriptions  almost look like some early form of  runes , although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.   Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people  migrated  widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 George Tate read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club at which a Mr John Collingwood Bruce agreed that the carvings had ""... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought.""  [ 2 ]  In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.  [ 3 ] .   Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in  Jungian psychology  and the views of  Mircea Eliade . According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other  atavistic  or  archetypal   symbols ) from different cultures and continents is a result of the  genetically  inherited structure of the human brain.   Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by  shamans  in an  altered state of consciousness [ 4 ] , perhaps induced by the use of natural  hallucinogens . Many of the  geometric   patterns  (known as  form constants ) which recur in petroglyphs and  cave paintings  have been shown to be ""hard-wired"" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs,  migraine  and other stimuli.   Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the  Kalahari  desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the  University of the Witwatersrand   [1] . Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:     Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the Sans world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.

(May 2008)       Chumash Rock Art  is a type of artwork created by the  Chumash people , mainly in caves or on cliffs in the mountains in areas of southern California.           Contents       1   Chumash people   2   Rock Art Locations   3   Shamans and Visions   4   Shamans and Rock Art   5   Rock Art Characteristics   6   Meanings of Rock Art   7   Conclusion   8   References               [ edit ]   Chumash people   Main article:  Chumash people   The Chumash lived in the present-day counties of  Santa Barbara ,  Ventura , and  San Luis  in southern California during the late period of history (c. AD 1300 to 1804). They were a  Hokan -speaking, maritime,  hunter-gatherer  society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as ""an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface."" Rock art may have been created by  shamans  during  vision quests , most commonly in the form of  pictographs  (paintings on rock), but sometimes  petroglyphs  (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Locations   Chumash Rock Art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been discovered by Campbell Grant. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the  Ventureno  area. The  Ventura  and  Santa Clara  rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the  Cuyama  region (north of the Ventureno area), where the  Sisquoc River  flows between the  San Rafael Mountains  and the  Sierra Madre Mountains . The most easily accessible example is at  Painted Cave SHP , an easy drive from  Santa Barbara, California .     [ edit ]   Shamans and Visions   According to David Whitley,  shamanism  was the ""cornerstone of religious beliefs in the Far West."" He defines shamanism as ""a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)."" In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a ""portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural."" The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or  altered state of consciousness . In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or  jimsonweed , shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'     [ edit ]   Shamans and Rock Art   Directly after the vision quest ended (usually after two or more nights), a shaman pondered and meditated on the visions he/she had been given by his spirit helpers. Then while still on the site of his/her vision quest he/she painted or engraved images onto rock surfaces (usually sandstone), depicting the spirits he/she saw and supernatural events he/she had been a part of in his/her vision, such as curing illness or making rain. The shaman spent so much energy remembering and concentrating on his/her visions because he believed that if any visions were forgotten, he/she would become ill and/or die. Whitley notes that the shamans also recorded their visions on rocks to be observed by future generations of shamans. The other members of the shaman's village took extra care not to go near, or even look at, the location where a shaman had his/her vision quest.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Characteristics   Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained  hematite  or  iron oxide , while yellow came from  limonite , blue and green from  copper  or  serpentine , white from  kaolin clays  or  gypsum , and black from  manganese  or  charcoal . Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.     [ edit ]   Meanings of Rock Art   In the early 20th century very little was known about Chumash rock art (or the rock art of southern California in general). When the art began to be studied in detail, two main questions arose from scholars: (1), who created rock art? and (2), what does it mean? A number of archaeologists attempted to address these questions; Julian Steward and Alfred Kroeber were among them. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain. However, the Native California Indians were very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some denied any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.: ""The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected,in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any"" (Grant 80). Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the idfferent Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ""Petroglyphs of California,"" Steward wrote: ""It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictrographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind...He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area"" (91).     [ edit ]   Conclusion   To this day, the exact meanings of Chumash rock art are largely unknown. It is generally believed that religion and astronomy play a role in the paintings, since the sun was an important part of their religion. The supernatural also played a role, through the vision quests of the shamans. Rock art was done as a representation of the interaction between the shaman and the sacred realm. Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says ""a  radiocarbon test  on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old'"" (123). Whether monochromatic or polychromatic, the rock paintings demonstrate the artistic talent of the Chumash people.     [ edit ]   References     Fagan, Brian. ""Ancient North America,"" 4th ed.

[ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs.   Somalia  has a large number of rock art found at sites across the country. The most prominent of these sites is the rock art recently discovered by French archaeologists in  Laas Geel .

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Cave paintings  are  paintings  on  cave  walls and ceilings, and the term is used especially for those dating to  prehistoric  times. The earliest known European cave paintings date to 32,000 years ago. The purpose of the paleolithic cave paintings is not known. The evidence suggests that they were not merely decorations of living areas, since the caves in which they have been found do not have signs of ongoing habitation. Also, they are often in areas of caves that are not easily accessed. Some theories hold that they may have been a way of transmitting information, while other theories ascribe them a religious or ceremonial purpose.

When  Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola  first encountered the  Magdalenian  paintings of the  Altamira cave ,  Cantabria ,  Spain  in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and increasing numbers of discoveries have illustrated their authenticity and have indicated high levels of  artistry  of  Upper Palaeolithic  humans who used only basic tools. Cave paintings can also give valuable clues as to the  culture  and beliefs of that era.     [ edit ]   Locations   Well known cave paintings include those of:     Lascaux , France   Pech Merle , near  Cabrerets , France  Official Site   La Marche ,in  Lussac-les-Chateaux , France   Chauvet Cave , near  Vallon-Pont-d'Arc , France   Cave of Altamira , near  Santillana del Mar ,  Cantabria , Spain   Cueva de La Pasiega ,  Cuevas de El Castillo ,  Cantabria , Spain   Cosquer Cave , with an entrance below  sea level  near  Marseille, France   Font de Gaume , in the  Dordogne  Valley in France     Other sites include  Creswell Crags ,  Nottinghamshire ,  England , (Cave etchings and  bas-reliefs  discovered in 2003), and Magura  [1] , Belogradchik,  Bulgaria .   Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of  erosion . One well-known example is the rock paintings of  Astuvansalmi  in the  Saimaa  area of  Finland .     [ edit ]   Age   Nearly 350 caves have now been discovered in France and Spain that contain art from prehistoric times. The age of the paintings in many sites has been a contentious issue, since methods like  radiocarbon dating  can be easily misled by contaminated samples of older or newer material [ citation needed ] , and caves and rocky overhangs (parietal art) are typically littered with debris from many time periods. Recent advances make it possible to date the paintings by sampling the pigment itself.  [2]   The choice of subject matter can also indicate date such as the  reindeer  at the Spanish cave of  Cueva de las Monedas  which imply the art is from the  last Ice Age . The oldest cave is that of  Chauvet , and its paintings are possibly 32,000 years old according to  radiocarbon  dating  [3] . Some researchers believe the drawings are too advanced for this era and question this age [ 1 ] .   Other examples may date as late as the Early Bronze Age, but the well known prolific and sophisticated style from Lascaux and Altamira died out about 10,000 years ago, coinciding with the advent of the Mesolithic period.          Spanish Cave Painting of Bulls         [ edit ]   Themes and patterns   The most common themes in cave paintings are large wild animals, such as  bison ,  horses ,  aurochs , and  deer , and tracings of human  hands  as well as abstract patterns, called  finger flutings . Drawings of humans are rare and are usually schematic rather than the more naturalistic animal subjects. Cave art may have begun in the  Aurignacian  period ( Hohle Fels , Germany), but reached its apogee in the late  Magdalenian  (Lascaux, France).   The paintings were drawn with red and yellow  ochre ,  hematite ,  manganese oxide  and  charcoal . Sometimes the silhouette of the animal was incised in the rock first.     [ edit ]   Theories and interpretations   Henri Breuil  interpreted the paintings as being hunting magic, meant to increase the number of animals. As there are some clay sculptures that seem to have been the targets of spears, this may partly be true, but does not explain the pictures of predators such as the  lion  or the bear.   An alternative theory, developed by  David Lewis-Williams  and broadly based on ethnographic studies of contemporary  hunter-gatherer  societies, is that the paintings were made by  Cro-Magnon   shamans . The  shaman  would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a trance state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way toward explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to  predators  and human hand-prints).   R. Dale Guthrie [ 2 ]  has studied not only the most artistic and publicized paintings but also a variety of lower quality art and figurines, and he identifies a wide range of skill and ages among the artists. He also points that the main themes in the paintings and other artifacts (powerful beasts, risky hunting scenes and the over-sexual representation of women in the  Venus figurines ) are to be expected in the fantasies of adolescent males, who made a big part of the  human population at the time .     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs. Human figures are much more common in African than in European rock art. [ 3 ]   Recently, an archeological team discovered the  Laas Gaa'l  cave paintings outside  Hargeisa  in  Somaliland . They show the ancient inhabitants of the area worshipping  cattle  and performing religious ceremonies.   Cave paintings found at the  ""Apollo 11 caves"" in  Namibia  may be among the earliest cave art. The estimated age of the images date from approximately 23,000 - 25,000 B.C.   Cave paintings are found in the  Tassili n'Ajjer  mountains in southeast  Algeria  also in the  Akakus ,  Mesak Settafet  and  Tadrart  in Libya and other Sahara regions including: Ayr mountains, Niger and Tibesti, Chad. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Australia   Significant early cave paintings have also been found in  Kakadu National Park  in  Australia .   The  park  has a large collection of  ochre  paintings. Ochre is a not an  organic material , so  carbon dating  of these pictures is impossible. Sometimes the approximate date, or at least, an  epoch , can be guessed from the content.

AD 1300 to 1804). They were a  Hokan -speaking, maritime,  hunter-gatherer  society whose livelihood was based on the sea. They developed excellent skills for catching fish, shellfish, and other marine mammals. Beyond fishing, however, they were also skilled in creating rock art. Hudson and Blackburn define rock art as ""an aesthetic, symbolic representation of significant concepts and entities that is painted on or carved into a rock surface."" Rock art may have been created by  shamans  during  vision quests , most commonly in the form of  pictographs  (paintings on rock), but sometimes  petroglyphs  (engravings on rock) as well. No one is absolutely certain about the meaning of the Chumash Rock art, but scholars generally agree that it is connected with religion and astronomy.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Locations   Chumash Rock Art is almost invariably found in caves or on cliffs in the mountains, although some small, portable painted rocks have been discovered by Campbell Grant. The rock art sites are always found near streams, springs, or some other source of permanent water. In his research of southern California rock art, Grant recorded numerous sites from different areas that were all close to a water source. He found twelve painted sites in the highest parts of the mountainous Chumash territory, the  Ventureno  area. The  Ventura  and  Santa Clara  rivers and several coastal streams flow through this area. He also recorded forty-one painted rock art sites in the  Cuyama  region (north of the Ventureno area), where the  Sisquoc River  flows between the  San Rafael Mountains  and the  Sierra Madre Mountains . The most easily accessible example is at  Painted Cave SHP , an easy drive from  Santa Barbara, California .     [ edit ]   Shamans and Visions   According to David Whitley,  shamanism  was the ""cornerstone of religious beliefs in the Far West."" He defines shamanism as ""a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) and the supernatural (or sacred realm and its spirits)."" In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shaman's village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a ""portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural."" The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or  altered state of consciousness . In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or  jimsonweed , shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears. Spirit helpers almost never took the form of an animal that was an important source of food, because it was 'taboo for a shaman to eat meat from the species of his helper.'     [ edit ]   Shamans and Rock Art   Directly after the vision quest ended (usually after two or more nights), a shaman pondered and meditated on the visions he/she had been given by his spirit helpers. Then while still on the site of his/her vision quest he/she painted or engraved images onto rock surfaces (usually sandstone), depicting the spirits he/she saw and supernatural events he/she had been a part of in his/her vision, such as curing illness or making rain. The shaman spent so much energy remembering and concentrating on his/her visions because he believed that if any visions were forgotten, he/she would become ill and/or die. Whitley notes that the shamans also recorded their visions on rocks to be observed by future generations of shamans. The other members of the shaman's village took extra care not to go near, or even look at, the location where a shaman had his/her vision quest.     [ edit ]   Rock Art Characteristics   Chumash rock art depicts images like humans, animals, celestial bodies, and other (at times ambiguous) shapes and patterns. These depictions vary considerably and appear to be in no particular order or arrangement. The colors of the paintings vary as well, from red or black monochromes (different shades of a single color) to elaborate polychromes (many various colors). The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of liquid binder like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds. The addition of an oil binder helped to make the paint permanent and waterproof. Orange and red paint contained  hematite  or  iron oxide , while yellow came from  limonite , blue and green from  copper  or  serpentine , white from  kaolin clays  or  gypsum , and black from  manganese  or  charcoal . Paint was applied with a person's finger or a brush. Grant organized the types of images depicted in the paintings into two categories: representational and abstract. Representational images include squares, circles and triangles, zigzags, crisscrosses, parallel lines, and pinwheels. Grant noted that in settled villages, abstract paintings were prominent, while the areas occupied by bands of hunting people reveal representational images.     [ edit ]   Meanings of Rock Art   In the early 20th century very little was known about Chumash rock art (or the rock art of southern California in general). When the art began to be studied in detail, two main questions arose from scholars: (1), who created rock art? and (2), what does it mean? A number of archaeologists attempted to address these questions; Julian Steward and Alfred Kroeber were among them. Because of some commonly occurring symbols in paintings, it was believed that at least portions of the rock art depicted themes of fertility, water, and rain. However, the Native California Indians were very reluctant to talk to anyone about the rock art and some denied any knowledge of it altogether. The natives' hesitancy to discuss the art led archaeologists to believe that they had no idea of the origin of the pictographs. Kroeber recorded some of his thoughts on the origins of the rock art in 1925.: ""The cave paintings of [Southern California]...represent a particular art, or local style or cult. This can be connected,in all probability, with the technological art of the Chumash. [An] association with...religion is also to be considered, although nothing positive is known in the matter. Many of the pictures may have been made by shamans; and it is quite possible that medicine men were not connected with the making of any"" (Grant 80). Kroeber was unsure about what specific associations could be made between the paintings and the artists. Julian Steward researched California rock art as well, and in 1929 he deduced that the only way to understand the meanings of the petroglyphs and pictographs was to compare them with the art and symbolism of the idfferent Indian groups and their respective culture areas. In his book ""Petroglyphs of California,"" Steward wrote: ""It has frequently been stated that the petroglyphs and pictrographs are meaningless figures made in idle moments by some primitive artist. The facts of distribution, however, show that this cannot be true. Since design elements and style are grouped in limited areas, the primitive artist must have made the inscriptions with something in mind...He executed, not random drawings, but figures similar to those made in other parts of the same area"" (91).     [ edit ]   Conclusion   To this day, the exact meanings of Chumash rock art are largely unknown. It is generally believed that religion and astronomy play a role in the paintings, since the sun was an important part of their religion. The supernatural also played a role, through the vision quests of the shamans. Rock art was done as a representation of the interaction between the shaman and the sacred realm. Concerning the age of the paintings, Grant says ""a  radiocarbon test  on pigment from a Santa Barbara area pictograph site showed that the sample was 'not over 2,000 years old'"" (123). Whether monochromatic or polychromatic, the rock paintings demonstrate the artistic talent of the Chumash people.     [ edit ]   References     Fagan, Brian. ""Ancient North America,"" 4th ed.

[ 9 ] ,  [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).     [ edit ]   Africa          Rock paintings from the  Western Cape       At  Ukhahlamba-Drakensberg ,  South Africa , now thought to be some 3,000 years old, the paintings by the  San  people who settled in the area some 8,000 years ago depict animals and humans, and are thought to represent religious beliefs.   Somalia  has a large number of rock art found at sites across the country. The most prominent of these sites is the rock art recently discovered by French archaeologists in  Laas Geel .

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

Petroglyphs on Newspaper Rock near Canyonlands National Park, south of Moab, south eastern Utah, USA              Rock carving known as ""Meerkatze"" (named by archaeologist Leo Frobenius), rampant lionesses in  Wadi Methkandoush , Mesak Settafet region of Libya.       Petroglyphs  are  images  created by removing part of a  rock  surface by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Outside North America, scholars often use terms such as ""carving"", ""engraving"", or other descriptions of the technique to refer to such images. Petroglyphs are found world-wide, and are often (but not always) associated with  prehistoric  peoples. The word comes from the  Greek  words  petros  meaning ""stone"" and  glyphein  meaning ""to carve"" (it was originally coined in  French  as  ptroglyphe ).   The term  petroglyph  should not be confused with  pictograph , which is an image drawn or painted on a rock face. Both types of image belong to the wider and more general category of  rock art .  Petroforms , or patterns and shapes made by many large rocks and boulders over the ground, are also quite different.  Inukshuks  are also unique, and found only in the Arctic (except for reproductions and imitations built in more southerly latitudes).

Nordic Bronze Age. The glyphs have been painted to make them more visible.              A petroglyph of a caravan of  bighorn sheep  near  Moab, Utah ,  USA ; a common theme in glyphs from the  desert  southwest       The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late  Upper Paleolithic  boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, if not earlier ( Kamyana Mohyla ). Around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, other precursors of  writing systems , such as  pictographs  and  ideograms , began to appear. Petroglyphs were still common though, and some cultures continued using them much longer, even until contact with  Western culture  was made in the 20th century. Petroglyphs have been found in all parts of the globe except  Antarctica  with highest concentrations in parts of  Africa ,  Scandinavia ,  Siberia , southwestern  North America  and  Australia .     [ edit ]   Interpretation   There are many theories to explain their purpose, depending on their location, age, and the type of image. Some petroglyphs are thought to be astronomical markers, maps, and other forms of symbolic communication, including a form of ""pre- writing "". They might also have been a by-product of other rituals: sites in India, for example, have been identified as musical instruments or ""rock gongs"".  [ 1 ]   Some petroglyph images probably had deep cultural and religious significance for the societies that created them; in many cases this significance remains for their descendants. Many petroglyphs are thought to represent some kind of not-yet-fully understood symbolic or ritual language. Later glyphs from the  Nordic Bronze Age  in Scandinavia seem to refer to some form of territorial boundary between  tribes , in addition to possible religious meanings. It also appears that local or regional dialects from similar or neighboring peoples exist. The  Siberian inscriptions  almost look like some early form of  runes , although there is not thought to be any relationship between them. They are not yet well understood.   Some researchers have noticed the resemblance of different styles of petroglyphs across different continents; while it is expected that all people would be inspired by their surroundings, it is harder to explain the common styles. This could be mere coincidence, an indication that certain groups of people  migrated  widely from some initial common area, or indication of a common origin. In 1853 George Tate read a paper to the Berwick Naturalists' Club at which a Mr John Collingwood Bruce agreed that the carvings had ""... a common origin, and indicate a symbolic meaning, representing some popular thought.""  [ 2 ]  In his cataloguing of Scottish rock art, Ronald Morris summarised 104 different theories on their interpretation.  [ 3 ] .   Other, more controversial, explanations are grounded in  Jungian psychology  and the views of  Mircea Eliade . According to these theories it is possible that the similarity of petroglyphs (and other  atavistic  or  archetypal   symbols ) from different cultures and continents is a result of the  genetically  inherited structure of the human brain.   Other theories suggest that petroglyphs were made by  shamans  in an  altered state of consciousness [ 4 ] , perhaps induced by the use of natural  hallucinogens . Many of the  geometric   patterns  (known as  form constants ) which recur in petroglyphs and  cave paintings  have been shown to be ""hard-wired"" into the human brain; they frequently occur in visual disturbances and hallucinations brought on by drugs,  migraine  and other stimuli.   Present-day links between shamanism and rock-art amongst the San people of the  Kalahari  desert have been studied by the Rock Art Research Institute (RARI) of the  University of the Witwatersrand   [1] . Though the San people's artworks are predominantly paintings, the beliefs behind them can perhaps be used as a basis for understanding other types of rock art, including petroglyphs. To quote from the RARI website:     Using knowledge of San beliefs, researchers have shown that the art played a fundamental part in the religious lives of its San painters. The art captured things from the Sans world behind the rock-face: the other world inhabited by spirit creatures, to which dancers could travel in animal form, and where people of ecstasy could draw power and bring it back for healing, rain-making and capturing the game.

[ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Location   Both petroglyphs and pictographs can be  parietal , meaning on the walls of a cave or rock shelter, open-air meaning they are made on exposed natural outcrops or monument-based which are made on stones consciously deposited.     [ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.  Devlet , the author of ""Rock Art and the Material Culture of Siberian and Central Asian Shamanism"" highlights, Another interpretation of these skeletal costume elements explains them as representations of a shaman brought back to life after the  dismemberment  that occurs during the initiation process: the depicted bones thus refer to the wearers own  skeleton  (43). The concept of  death  and  revival  is often associated with shamans and the way they are portrayed. The bones were usually on the back of the shamans jacket or used on the breast-piece.   Another important aspect used to distinguish shamans in rock art depictions is that they are wearing fringed  fabric . There are differences in the lengths of the fringe and where on the shaman the fringe is located. In the rock art, the fringe was usually long single strands attached to different parts of the shamans body. The  symbolism  of the fringe can be interpreted in several ways. One example is, The fringe on a shamans coat is an important element, which marks his or her  ornithomorphic  nature (i.e. the ability to transform into a bird or to gain its abilities such as the capacity for flight)  (Devlet 44). The concept of fringe being correlated with flying was mainly used in rock art in the  Altai ,  Tuva , and  Mongolian  regions.   A more mainstream characteristic is the detection of the shamans  ritualistic   drum . Even though there are different types, shapes, and images painted on the shamans drum, it is clearly depicted in the rock art. The range of  decoration  used on the drums varied from simplistic to innately elaborate. The resemblance is remarkably illustrated, In the  Altai   region , images depicted on historical shamanic drums demonstrate a striking similarity with what is shown on the rock engravings (Devlet 47).

There are some 250 sites which are located in the municipality of Mulege within the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve in the state of Baja California Sur in Northern Mexico. Motifs include human figures, weapons, and animal species such as rabbit, puma, lynx, deer, wild goat/sheep, whale, turtle, tuna, sardine, octopus, eagle, and pelican; there are also abstract elements of various forms. The paintings vary in age from 1100 BC to AD 1300.   The paintings are noted for their high quality, extent, the variety and originality of human and animal representations, remarkable colors, and excellent state of preservation. The rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco were nominated in 1989 and became a World Heritage Site in 1993.

[ edit ]   Age   The earliest evidence of painting derives from archaeological sites in two rock-shelters in  Arnhem Land , in northern Australia. In the lowest layer of material at these sites there are used pieces of ochre estimated to be 60,000 years old. Archaeologists have also found a fragment of rock painting preserved in a limestone rock-shelter in the  Kimberley  region of North-Western Australia dated at 40 000 years old.  [1] Pigments from the ""Bradshaw paintings"" of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date aboriginal settlement.  [2] [3]     [ edit ]   Creation           Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka  rock painting,  World Heritage Site       Petroglyphs are created by rock removal, including scratching, abrading, pecking, carving, drilling, incising and sculpting. Locations of choice are rock facets coated with patina, a dark mineral accumulation on rock surfaces. Petroglyphs remove the patina, exposing the contrasting lighter rock interior. Instances of negative images, produced by removing the patina surrounding the intended figure, are also known. Sometimes petroglyphs are painted or accentuated by polishing. The degree of repatination indicates relative dating. Some of the most ancient petroglyphs are the same color as the surrounding rock.   Pictography is the application of pigments. Survival of ancient paintings is attributable to use of mineral pigments, most commonly  manganese ,  hematite ,  malachite ,  gypsum ,  limonite , clays and various oxides. The best preserved pictography is found under sheltering overhangs and in caves. The simplest pictographs are wet clay finger drawings and charcoal drawings. To produce crayons or paints first the minerals had to be finely ground and combined with binding materials. Crayons and animal hair brushes have been excavated in caves with paintings. Exceedingly fine lines evidence the production of excellent brushes. The most common rock art element found around the world, the human hand, exemplifies several pictography types. A technique used since the Neolithic is spraying around a hand, resulting in a negative image. The more common positive print was often made with pigment applied to the hand and transferred to the rock.     [ edit ]   Groupings: Motifs and panels       Pictograph, southeastern Utah, attributed to Basketmaker period, Puebloan archaeological culture.       Traditionally, individual markings are called  motifs  and groups of motifs are known as  panels . Sequences of panels are treated as  archaeological sites . This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art's creators. Even the word 'art' carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.   Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of  cultures  perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact  rituals . Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.     [ edit ]   Shamanism Motif   Common features in rock art that are related to portraying  shamans  were  bones  and other  skeletal  remains on their  coats . One reason for the bones would be that they were used as a type of  armor  for protecting the shaman on his journeys through different worlds.
