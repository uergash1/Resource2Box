Please  introduce links  to this page from other  articles related to it .  (October 2008)           Living With Fibromyalgia: A Journey of Hope and Understanding       Directed by   Stephen Eyer       Produced by   Daneen Akers,  Stephen Eyer       Written by   Daneen Akers,  Stephen Eyer       Distributed by   Trillusion Media       Release  date(s)   March 22 ,  2007       Running time   71 mins       Language   English       Budget   N/A       Living With Fibromyalgia: A Journey of Hope and Understanding  is a  2007   documentary film  by Stephen Eyer and Daneen Akers from Trillusion Media, Inc. that explores the  chronic pain  condition known as  fibromyalgia .   The film was created as a resource for  fibromyalgia  patients and their families and to help create awareness about this condition. It tells the stories of seven patients suffering from  fibromyalgia  including Darlene Akers, the mother of one of the filmmakers, and Lynne Matallana, the president of the National Fibromyalgia Association and the author of The Complete Idiots Guide to Fibromyalgia. The documentary premiered in  San Diego  on  March 22 ,  2007  at the  Hillcrest  Landmark Theatre and has garnered wide praise within the  fibromyalgia  community for its empathetic approach and hopeful message.

The patients share how they were diagnosed, how  fibromyalgia  has changed their lives, how they deal with  fibromyalgia , and their advice for other patients and family members of patients.   Interwoven with the patient stories are experts from the Fibromyalgia Rehabilitation Program at  Cedars-Sinai Medical Center  in  Los Angeles ,  California . The filmmakers talk to Judy Fishman, an  occupational therapist , Dr. Michael Gilewski, a  psychologist , Miriam Siegal, a  physical therapist , and extensively to Dr. Stuart Silverman, a  rheumatologist  and long-time  fibromyalgia  researcher.   While patients do share how they personally have dealt with the  pain ,  fatigue , and related symptoms of  fibromyalgia , no specific medications are endorsed, rather a broad approach tailored for individual patients combining a mixture of traditional and alternative practices is advocated. The films overall message is that  fibromyalgia  is a real, extremely difficult and often debilitating condition, but there is still  hope  for a fulfilling and even healthy life after a diagnosis.   The filmmakers have stated that Living With Fibromyalgia is the film they wished their family could have sat down to watch together when they first heard the word "" fibromyalgia .""     [ edit ]   Funding   Funding for the film was primarily provided by the filmmakers, one of whom sold her house as part of their fundraising efforts. [ 1 ]  The filmmakers have donated up to 10 percent of all sales of the film to the National Fibromyalgia Association to support fibromyalgia research and education.     [ edit ]   Reception and Legacy   The documentary was the centerpiece of the National Fibromyalgia Associations  2007  Fibromyalgia Awareness Day campaign, screening at over 125 locations nationwide over the  May 12  weekend.

Quit Smoking     Note: You need javascript to open and use the calculator or form in this article.     It can be one of the hardest things to do: quit smoking. But medical experts say it can also be one of the best things you can do for your health. It can also save you money.    Just use our handy  calculator  to compute how much it costs in a year to smoke. Then read on to learn about the health costs - and find out some tips that have helped others quit for good.     NOTE: You need Javascript to open and use the calculator, which your browser has apparently disabled. You can simply multiply the price you pay for a pack of cigarettes times the number of packs you smoke in a week times 52 instead.     One in every five deaths in the United States is smoking-related according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, the CDC points out about 10 million people in the United States have died from causes attributed to smoking (including heart disease, emphysema, and other respiratory diseases) since the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in 1964. (Read about "" Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease "" "" Coronary Heart Disease "" "" Respiratory System "") Two million of those deaths were the result of lung cancer. (Read about "" Lung Cancer "") Heavy smokers, or those who smoke over a pack of cigarettes a day, can find themselves at the greatest risk. The CDC also says exposure to secondhand smoke causes an estimated 3,000 deaths from lung cancer among American adults. Scientific studies also link secondhand smoke with heart disease. In addition, the American Cancer Society (ACS) says 90 percent of people with oral cancer use tobacco. (Read about "" Oral Cancer "")   More health risks   According to the National Women's Health Information Center (NWHIC), women have seen the highest increase in smoking related diseases. Since 1960, lung cancer deaths in women are up 400 percent, according to CDC. NWHIC says tobacco use by pregnant women has been linked with increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and mental retardation. (Read about "" Healthy Pregnancy "")   Smoking is also considered a trigger for asthma, according to the American Lung Association (ALA), and secondhand smoke worsens the health of children with asthma. (Read about "" Asthma "") Studies also show that cigarette smokers have more than double the risk of a heart attack compared to non-smokers; and according to ALA, the earlier you start smoking, the greater the health risk. (Read about "" Coronary Heart Disease "") Smoking is also considered a risk factor for developing cataracts, according to CDC. (Read about "" Cataracts "") Smoking can also increase your risk of developing pneumothorax, a condition that can cause the lung to collapse. (Read about "" Pneumothorax "")   Smokeless tobacco   Spit tobacco (also called snuff or chewing tobacco) is not a safe alternative either. According to CDC, one ""dip"" of smokeless tobacco can deliver as much nicotine as several cigarettes. CDC also says that using spit tobacco can cause cracked lips, bleeding gums and sores of the mouth that never heal. (Read about "" Oral Health "") Worst of all, use of spit tobacco can cause mouth cancer and other kinds of cancer. (Read about "" Oral Cancers "") Chewing tobacco also may play a role in heart disease and stroke. (Read about "" Stroke "")   Quitting for good   There is some good news, though. The American Heart Association says that when you quit, your risk of disease diminishes rather quickly. Eventually your risk will be about the same as that of someone who never smoked.   Unfortunately, it can be very hard to quit because nicotine is a very addictive drug. (Read about "" Addiction "") CDC says that for some people, it can be as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Often people make multiple tries, before finally being able to quit. As a result, you may worry that - since you've tried before and failed - it will never happen.   It can help if you stop focusing on the past and start picturing yourself as a non-smoker. Think of the benefits you can have: better health, better breath and more money because you won't be spending it on tobacco products.   The U.S. Public Health Service says that the more support you have, the greater your chance for success. Some of its recommendations:     Talk with your doctor or health care provider to choose a quit smoking plan that is best for you.   Get individual, group, or telephone counseling. The more counseling you have, the better your chances are of quitting.   Ask about programs at your hospital, or call your local health department for information about programs in your area.   Ask about programs at your local chapters of the American Cancer Society, American Lung Association, or American Heart Association     Some other ideas from the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association include:     Avoid smoking ""cues""  - Remove all reminders of smoking from your house, such as ashtrays and lighters. The adage ""out of sight, out of mind"" can apply here.   Set a date to stop  - Some people find it easier to set a date when they'll stop completely, then work up to that date.   Keep a journal  - Before your ""quit date"" keep a journal of when you're most likely to smoke. Do you light up after meals? Then plan some activity to use after mealtime as a substitute.   Ask for help  - Enlist the help of family and friends. If they smoke too, see if you can get them to join you in a mutual program to stop smoking. You may also want to join a support group through your local hospital or American Lung Association.   Change your routine  - Smoking is often linked with certain habits or routines, so you may find it helpful to change those routines. If you light up with a cup of coffee, for example, switch to tea instead. If you smoke while watching TV, try keeping your hands busy with some handicraft work or do crossword puzzles.     Medications   Some smokers may want to consider using medication to try to stop. There are nicotine and non-nicotine medications available. Examples include:     nicotine patch   nicotine gum and lozenges   nicotine nasal spray   nicotine inhaler   non-nicotine medication that helps ease withdrawal symptoms and block nicotine receptors in the brain   for some people, a non-nicotine antidepressant may also be recommended     According to NWHIC, the nicotine substitutes can help you work on the ""habit"" and ""social"" parts of quitting first. Generally, you quit smoking, and use the nicotine substitute for one or two months, then gradually cut down on the nicotine substitute until you stop that, too. Some nicotine substitutes require a prescription; gum and patches can be bought without one. There is also non-nicotine medication that acts at sites in the brain (Read about "" The Brain "") affected by nicotine and may help ease withdrawal symptoms. Your doctor may also recommend a non-nicotine antidepressant. Keep in mind, however, that all medications can have side effects. For example, nicotine replacement gums and lozenges can sometimes cause dizziness, headaches and rapid heart rate. (Read about "" Headaches "" "" Arrhythmia "") Some non-nicotine anti-smoking medications have been linked to severe mental problems. So always talk to your doctor or healthcare provider first, especially if you are pregnant or have heart or other medical problems. (Read about "" Medicine Safety "")   Avoiding relapses   Whatever method you choose to quit, remember that there will still be temptation, even after you quit. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, most relapses occur within the first 3 months after quitting, so don't be discouraged if you start smoking again. Try again, remembering that most people try several times before they finally quit.   Here are some difficult situations the Surgeon General suggests you watch for:     Alcohol  - Avoid drinking alcohol. Drinking lowers your chances of success.   Other smokers  - Being around smoking can make you want to smoke.   Weight gain  - Many smokers will gain weight when they quit, usually less than 10 pounds. Eat a healthy diet and stay active. Don't let weight gain distract you from your main goal of quitting smoking. You can lose the weight later. (Read about "" Losing Weight "")     If you are having problems with any of these situations, talk to your doctor or other healthcare provider.   Above all, many former smokers say that once you do stop, NEVER have that first cigarette again. Even if you tell yourself it will be ""just this one,"" that first cigarette can lead you right back where you started.

However, if you are considering stopping smoking, you may already realize that quitting requires more than willpower or scaring yourself with statistics of why smoking is bad. Conventional smoking cessation systems often don't work in the long term because they do not address the real reasons that people smoke. Listed below are five often unidentified reasons that people smoke. These reasons might surprise you. Before you engage in your stop smoking process, take some time and identify the important underlying motivations of why you choose to smoke. By understanding those real reasons, you can generate a personalized stop smoking plan that incorporates new strategies of coping and dealing with life. 1. Smoking Is A Lifestyle Coping Tool For many people, smoking is a reliable lifestyle coping tool. Although every person’s specific reasons to smoke are unique, they all share a common theme. Smoking is used as a way to suppress uncomfortable feelings, and smoking is used to alleviate stress, calm nerves, and relax. No wonder that when you are deprived of smoking, your mind and body are unsettled for a little while. Below is a list of some positive intentions often associated with smoking. Knowing why you smoke is one of the first steps towards quitting. Check any and all that apply to you. ___ Coping with anger, stress, anxiety, tiredness, or sadness ___ Smoking is pleasant and relaxing ___ Smoking is stimulating ___ Acceptance – being part of a group ___ As a way to socialize ___ Provides support when things go wrong ___ A way to look confident and in control ___ Keeps weight down ___ Rebellion – defining self as different or unique from a group ___ A reminder to breathe ___ Something to do with your mouth and hands ___ Shutting out stimuli from the outside world ___ Shutting out emotions from the inside world ___ Something to do just for you and nobody else ___ A way to shift gears or changes states ___ An way to feel confident ___ A way to shut off distressing feelings ___ A way to deal with stress or anxiety ___ A way to get attention ___ Marking the beginning or the end of something 2. Smoking Tranquilizer The habit of cigarette smoking is often used to tranquilize emotional issues like anxiety, stress, or low self-esteem. In addition, smoking provides comfort to people with conditions of chronic pain and depression. Smokers with emotional stress or chronic pain often turn to smoking as an attempt to treat their pain. For instance, they may use it to reduce anxiety, provide a sense of calmness and energy, and elevate their mood. Some evidence does suggest that nicotine has some pain-relief benefits. Nicotine releases brain chemicals which soothe pain, heighten positive emotions, and creating a sense of reward. However, any benefit from smoking only eases the pain for a few minutes. Cigarettes contain many other chemicals shown to worsen healing ability of bone, tooth, and cartilage. The mental association between smoking and pain relief can make quitting quite difficult, as can the increased short-term discomfort that quitting smoking adds to a person already suffering with chronic pain, depression, or emotional distress. What are effective ways for people with chronic pain – whether physical or emotional – to make the decision to quit smoking? First, evidence shows that in people who suffer chronic pain, smokers have more pain than nonsmokers do. Also, accept that smoking cessation may indeed make you feel worse in the short run, but may be key to regaining enough vitality to live fully with pain. 3. The Feel Good Syndrome Smoking is a way to avoid feeling unpleasant emotions such as sadness, grief, and anxiety. It can hide apprehensions, fears, and pain. This is accomplished partly through the chemical effects of nicotine on the brain. When smoking, the release of brain chemicals makes smokers feel like they are coping and dealing with life and stressful emotional situations. Nicotine brings up a level of good feelings. Cigarette smokers are aware when nicotine levels and good feelings begin to decrease, and light up quickly enough to stay in their personal comfort zone. However, they may not realize that avoiding their feelings is not the same as taking positive steps to create a life of greater potential and meaning. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) reports that people suffering from nicotine withdrawal have increased aggression, anxiety, hostility, and anger. However, perhaps these emotional responses are due not to withdrawal, but due to an increased awareness of unresolved emotions. If smoking dulls emotions, logically quitting smoking allows awareness of those emotions to bubble up to the surface. If emotional issues aren’t resolved, a smoker may feel overwhelmed and eventually turn back to cigarettes to deal with the uncomfortable feelings. 4. Smoking Makes You Feel Calm and Alive Smokers often say that lighting up a cigarette can calm their nerves, satisfy their cravings, and help them feel energized. Indeed, nicotine in tobacco joins on to receptors in your brain that release “feel good” chemicals that can make you feel calm and energized all at once. Smoking acts as a drug, inducing a feeling of well-being with each puff. But, it’s a phony sense of well-being that never produces a permanent satisfying or fulfilling result. Smoking lures you into believing that you can escape some underlying truth or reality. However, smoking doesn’t allow you to actually transform your day-to-day life and live connected to your deeper hopes and dreams. Instead, when you smoke, the carbon monoxide in the smoke bonds to your red blood cells, taking up the spaces where oxygen needs to bond. This makes you less able to take in the deep, oxygen-filled breath needed to bring you life, to active new energy, to allow health and healing, and bring creative insight into your problems and issues. 5. You Are In The Midst Of Transition If you previously quit smoking, and then resumed the habit once again, consider the idea that perhaps you are in the midst of some “growing pains.” Perhaps you were feeling dissatisfied with some aspect of your life and contemplating making change. However, developing spiritually, emotionally, and physically brings with it the experience of discomfort. Old beliefs rise up, creating sensations of hurt, pain, sadness, anxiety, and uneasiness. You were feeling dissatisfied, restless, ready to change, but then felt the fear that change often ignites. Smoking provides an escape from those uncomfortable feelings. However, smoking also brings an abrupt halt to personal transformation and the evolution of self. Although painful, these feelings are necessary in your personal development. Learning to accept feelings in a new way can help lead you out of disempowering or limiting beliefs, and into a life filled with greater happiness, satisfaction, contentment, or purpose. When you stop smoking and start breathing – conscious, deep, smoke-free, oxygen-filled breaths – your evolution will start up once again. Why Do You Smoke?  If you smoke, then you do so because the act of smoking is personally meaningful to you. Therefore, if you are considering quitting, take some time and explore the reasons underlying your decision to smoke. Become interested, observe yourself, and get curious. Allow yourself an opportunity to turn into a smoking journalist, ready to uncover an intriguing mystery. Before lighting up your next cigarette, ask yourself: a. What positive functions do I believe smoking provides me? b. How will smoking help or change the situation? c. What situations make me smoke the most? d. What emotions or feelings am I trying to avoid or deny? e. If I didn’t smoke right now, what would I feel? How would I handle that feeling? f. What would I do with the energy that is freed up from smoking cessation? The most important factor in stopping smoking is a genuine desire to stop smoking. You were not a born smoker; it’s something you learned to do. Learning new ways of coping with stress is possible, as is learning new ways to relax and raise confidence levels. Use the reasons presented above as clues to uncover the underlying reasons why you smoke. Then, in addition to making a firm decision to stop smoking, also make a firm plan to address your underlying needs. You’re not only kicking the habit, you’re also creating a new balance with your body, mind, and self!

Go to your pantry and look for a white vinegar. Also go to your bathroom and pick your favorite toothpaste. I prefer the sweet Colgate toothpaste. The key to forget smoking (even if you don't want to quit) is by doing a general and thorough clean-up of one's taste buds and mouth walls. That's right - Clean your mouth immaculately! It is filled with garbage called cigarette or tobacco tars (the color tainter of the tip of a smoker's thumb and forefinger) that further cause bad odor mouth emission. They are the culprits (and the poison in fact) that induce a smoker to salivate to light up when seeing another smoking or smells cigarette smoke. The smoker is like an addicted ice cream consumer that makes a person fatter and fatter (another curse of affluence) whose mouth walls and taste buds are like motels for rotten ice cream residues and cause a person also to salivate when seeing someone eats ice cream. Do yourself a favor after reading this article and it will induce you to forget smoking even if you don't want to quit because, at least, you have given your mouth a break from that cancer causing tar and rotten ice cream residues. They progressively rout your throat or lungs for some months or years now without knowing or else it would be too late and incurable when you start feeling ""feverish"" or unusually weak to get up one morning from a budding cancer pain or an onset of diabetes that is caused by the destruction of your pancreas due to smoking. Fill up to 1/3 of a regular drinking glass with vinegar and dilute it with water within your level of tolerance. Use up successively in one session the whole quantity of the vinegar to gargle the mouth. If you are curious, catch the gargled vinegar in another crystal clear glass and see how much blacken tars and other particles have been dislodged that have been comfortably residing in your taste buds and mouth walls for so many months or years. Follow through with water gargle as much as you wish to wring out any remaining tars or rotten ice cream residue, as the case may be. Thereafter, promptly squeeze out an inch of toothpaste and use it to gargle with water. Do this at least twice successively after the vinegar gargle. In the next two days, do this toothpaste gargle twice a day - with no more vinegar - once after breakfast and before going to bed. On the third day and every 4 or 5 days thereafter, do the toothpaste gargle once a week. If at any time you feel like smoking or have an unusual taste in your mouth, gargle or drink water instead of lighting another stick of cigarette. Do not re-infect your immaculately cleaned food portal or else you will get a relapse in your addictions. If you smoke again, you will become like a defeated coward warrior. Are you? After two weeks doing the toothpaste gargles, you will end up hating the smell or smoke of cigarettes - GUARANTEED. Question: Why smoke when you now hate the taste or smell of cigarette? This is how I accidentally forgot and quit smoking. Accidentally because all I wanted for gargling vinegar and toothpaste was to sweeten my breath instead of covering it with oral deodorants. Do yourself and your love ones an additional favor with the following: No if's and but's - > Throw away; empty your pocket; do not keep within your reach, any pack or stick of cigarettes, lighters and ashtrays. Disable the cigarette lighter; thoroughly clean the ashtray; spray deodorant to remove cigarette odor, in your vehicle. Keep a bottle of drinking water handy in the car or handbag. When the urge to smoke comes up, simply drink water. Do not allow anyone to smoke inside your car. If you are a musician, avoid playing with a mouthpieced musical instrument like the saxophone or harmonica. Do what a non-smoker does. Don't be a slave to cigarettes . Beware: According to statistics, smoking a stick of cigarette can shorten a person's life by  eleven minutes . That's around 3-1/2 hours loss of life expectancy for smoking every regular pack, or 5-1/2 hours for every long size pack, of cigarettes. Sickly children are often caused by a cigarette smoker in the family. Do them a favour. QUIT SMOKING. Consult your doctor before using this plan.

If you've finally resolved to stop smoking, good for you! You've made the right choice. Use the following tips and suggestions to help you stick true to your word and avoid a relapse. Know the Ugly Truth about Smoking Concerned family members and friends have always told you about the bad things that could happen to smokers but you've always turned a deaf ear to their words, haven't you? TV ads and shows also tried giving you the same information but didn't you turn a blind eye to them? Ignorance is bliss but if you want to quit smoking for good, it's time to take your head out of the sand. Confront the ugly truth about smoking. Read and watch everything you can about the deadly consequences of smoking - it's terrifying, but it will also remind you about the rightness of your decision. Let the Right People Know about Your Resolution Your most trusted loved ones should definitely know about your resolution. They can help you stick to your word by keeping an eagle eye of your cigarettes. They'll warn you beforehand and remind you about your promise. They'll give you praise and encouragement when you need it. A hug may not be scientifically proven to be as potent as any medicine but we can't deny how good it feels to be hugged when we're in need of help. You'll definitely need lots of it when you're working on eliminating nicotine from your system! Get Professional Help Why make it harder for you than you should? Professional help and treatment is available in every corner of the world. Take it! You might not think you don't need anyone's help except yours, but you do. Believe it or not but smoking is also a medical problem. Your mind and body has an unreasonable dependency on nicotine and that's what you're fighting against. These medical professionals have studied for years to develop the right program that will help smokers get rid of their unwanted habit. You now have the opportunity to work with them. It's definitely your loss if you refuse their help. Use Water as a Weapon Water is incredibly important in any quit-smoking journey. Water detoxifies your body and cravings for nicotine are swept along by the current of harmful substances being flushed out of your body. Drinking lots of water will also help you feel better about yourself and that always count in the battle against nicotine dependency. Keep a Journal There will be times that you'll feel like no one in the world understands what you're going through, not even your fellow smokers who are also struggling to eliminate smoking from their lives. These are dangerous times and if you waver during these moments, you might end up lighting a stick and doing the worst thing you could do. During these times, a journal might just be the lifeline you need. A journal won't talk back, will always listen readily and patiently, and allow your feelings to settle down by itself until the moment of crisis has passed. A journal is also important because it allows you to look back and see how far you've grown. Your progress is the best source of comfort and inspiration: it's proof that you've come a long way and if you keep up the good work then quitting smoking might just no longer be a dream but a very possible reality. Rejoice on How Much You're Saving Consider this. How much does a pack of cigarettes cost? How many packs can you consume in a week? Multiply that figure with the number of weeks in a year. That's how much you spend in one year for smoking alone - a habit that erodes the health of your lungs and later on, damages other parts of your body as well. If you quit smoking, you immediately save the same amount and yes, you definitely deserve to spend some or even all of it to reward yourself. The resolution to quit smoking is never easy for anyone. It can wreak huge changes on your life or your very own personality. Regardless of this, know that your decision is the right one and if you work hard, you'll soon have the opportunity to enjoy unimagined rewards because of it.

Laser teeth whitening is undertaken in salons where clients have a gum dam applied to protect their gums and then a stain removing gel is applied before the laser light is activated. The gel then gains deep in to the enamel removing the staining and this is all done just under one hour. Typically the teeth are lightened by 6-8 shades and the treatment can last up to 18 months depending on how and when the staining that caused the problem is then minimized otherwise the benefit is decreased. Nicotine is not the only bad habit to cause staining to the enamel but caffeine, red wine, gravy and sauces will also stain the teeth but like many things it will depend on the frequency of usage but with such a simple and time effective treatment available for your teeth then no need to worry. Laser teeth whitening is also known as zoom whitening which is a commonly used name in the USA and even the Americans have developed Zoom 2 teeth whitening which is essentially the same but early adopters will want to try new names and ideas. The name aside laser teeth whitening is a huge growth industry and with added benefits like helping clients to quit smoking then no wonder customers are prepared to travel to get the treatment.

I've done it a thousand times."" -- Mark Twain   If Mark Twain were alive today, he could have been more successful in his efforts to quit smoking -- thanks to what modern science has learned about smoking cessation.   In Twain's time -- and for several decades after his death in 1910 -- many people thought of smoking tobacco as merely a habit, and they believed that quitting was simply a matter of individual choice and willpower. Smoking was not then widely recognized as  addictive , but we know now that it can be a strong addiction and that for many smokers willpower alone is not enough to give up tobacco permanently.   In recent years, researchers have learned a great deal about the factors that help people quit smoking successfully, the barriers that may interfere with smoking cessation, and the special problems faced by particular populations -- including teenagers. Scientists have also developed new techniques for smoking cessation -- including both drugs and counseling methods -- that substantially increase the chances of success.    If you have a friend or relative who would like to stop smoking, you might want to suggest that the person make a doctor's appointment to talk about quitting. People often don't think of going to their doctors for advice in this situation, perhaps because they don't consider smoking to be a medical problem, but doctors are actually a very useful resource. They usually know about organized stop-smoking programs in the community, and they can prescribe medicines that can help a person quit smoking successfully.     Counseling  and  medication  -- especially if they're used together -- can increase the likelihood that a smoker will be able to quit permanently. However, even with these types of help, quitting smoking is difficult. Everyone who has ever quit smoking will tell you that quitting is one of the toughest things they have ever done. The best way to avoid facing this tough problem, of course, is never to start smoking to begin with.   Stopping smoking is one of the most important and most challenging lifestyle changes an individual can make. Considering the many health, social, and economic benefits of quitting it is in the smoker's best interest to quit. More than 45 million Americans have liberated themselves from smoking, so it is possible to quit -- and quit for good.   Note:   This section of the website is based on a report by the American Council on Science and Health ( Kicking Butts in the 21st Century ) that summarizes what science has learned about smoking cessation -- with an emphasis on methods that have been proven to work. The report also describes some new smoking cessation techniques that are currently under development and evaluates some alternative methods that have been advocated as aids to smoking cessation. This report is not intended as a stop-smoking guide; instead, it is best used as a source of background information to complement the stop-smoking advice available from local and national health organizations, government agencies, and physicians.        background -- the magnitude of the problem   Because cigarettes are  addictive , quitting smoking can be difficult, and people who try to quit often fail. Recent surveys show that among current smokers, about 40% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit. But only about 5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently. These numbers look rather dismal, don't they? Actually, though, the situation is not quite that bad. The likelihood that a person will quit smoking successfully increases with each attempt to quit. After several tries, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. More than 45 million Americans have stopped smoking.    More than 46 million American adults currently smoke, and the number of adolescent smokers is increasing annually.(1)  Cigarette smoking contributes to more than 430,000 deaths in the United States each year. Tobacco dependence is now recognized as a clinical addiction and even as a chronic disease -- one of the most widespread in the world.   Quitting smoking has major health benefits. In the long term, smoking cessation reduces the risk of  lung cancer  and other  cancers ,  stroke ,  heart disease ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) , and a host of other diseases. In the short term, quitting has some immediate health benefits such as reducing fatigue and shortness of breath and increasing arterial circulation and libido.(2)    Recent U.S. surveys show that among current smokers, nearly 41% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit.(1)  But only about 4-5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently.(1)  The prospects for successful smoking cessation are not as dismal as these numbers seem to indicate, however. The chance of success increases with each quit attempt and with the use of effective smoking cessation methods. After repeated attempts, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. Presently, more than 45 million Americans have quit smoking, and the total number of smokers has slowly declined in recent years.(1)    The first smoking cessation programs began in the 1950s, after research had shown that smoking was a serious health hazard. In 1955, public ""stop smoking clinics"" were introduced in Sweden; they used medications, pamphlets, lectures, and physician counseling to help people quit. These clinics spread to the rest of Europe and the United States in the 1960s and have evolved into what are now comprehensive, multi-faceted, individualized programs.   Smoking cessation rates in the United States started to stabilize in the 1990s, after having increased over the prior few decades.(1)  Evidence suggests that this is because the number of quit attempts as well as the success of each attempt stabilized.(3)  However, in 1990, only 10% of quitters used some form of treatment,(4)  whereas as many as 35% do so today.(5)  There are several ways to approach smoking cessation, and individuals must decide for themselves which program or method is right for them. However, the more programs and methods available -- and the more a smoker is educated about quitting -- the greater the likelihood of success.       successful quitter   All smoking cessation programs have at least one thing in common - a flexible notion of what it takes to become a successful quitter. The prerequisites for success vary from individual to individual, but tend to include the following:     Motivation, Desire, Commitment:  Smokers who choose to quit should have strong personal reasons that motivate them to do so. People who attempt to quit solely to please others are usually headed for failure. Successful quitters must make a firm commitment to stop.     Social Support:  Since quitting smoking is incredibly difficult, it is no surprise that support from other people can be helpful in aiding a smoker in quitting. In one study of former adolescent smokers, 8 of the top 11 factors that had helped them to quit smoking involved a form of help from friends and/or family members.(69)   Support  for smoking cessation can come from both close to home (such as friends and relatives), or further away (such as  support groups ,  counselors , or an  online  quitting buddy).      Timing:  The time at which a smoker chooses to quit is very important to the outcome. A quit attempt can temporarily affect a person's lifestyle, state of mind, and general wellbeing. Trying to quit in the midst of an important business deal or a difficult family or personal situation can lower the chances of success.     Choice of Method:  No particular smoking cessation method is right for everyone. However, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) suggests that all smokers trying to quit should use some form of  drug therapy  (such as nicotine replacement therapy or  bupropion ), if possible, in combination with some form of  counseling , behavioral therapy, or social support.  However, not all experts agree that pharmacological agents are needed by all smokers. Smokers should plan ahead and choose the methods that most closely conform to their personal needs. Since some types of medication are only available by prescription, it is a good idea for smokers to discuss their smoking cessation plans with a physician. Physicians can also provide counseling, and they can refer smokers to organized smoking cessation programs in the community.     Repetition:  One of the main keys to successful quitting is repetition. Most smokers will try to quit several times before succeeding. With each attempt, the smoker learns more about what to expect from the quitting process, and the chance of success increases. Many smokers are not aware of this fact and may become needlessly discouraged when they relapse after an initial unsuccessful attempt.       motivators for quitting   Although smokers must make their own decisions to quit, several common factors often serve as motivators for quitting.     Health Benefits:  Improved health seems to be the primary motivator for quitting. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking can be greatly reduced or even reversed through cessation.(2)  Immediate benefits of quitting include a decrease in blood pressure, a lowered pulse rate, an increased oxygen level in the blood, and a decreased blood carbon monoxide level.(7)  Also, the ability to smell and taste is enhanced. After two weeks of abstinence, circulation to the extremities improves, blood pressure remains lower, and lung function improves. After just a few weeks to a month, cough, sinus congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath all decrease, although cough may actually worsen right after quitting. Further, ex-smokers are less likely than current smokers to have colds, develop  gum disease , experience fertility problems (in both  males  and  females ), or experience  erectile dysfunction .   Long-term benefits may also motivate smokers to quit. One year after quitting, the risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., angina) is reduced by nearly half compared to those who continue to smoke.(7,8)  And after as little as two to five years, that risk can be decreased to levels approaching those who have never smoked.(8,9)  After five years of abstinence, the risk of  stroke  is reduced, approaching that of people who have never smoked. The risk of  lung cancer  decreases with the number of years of abstinence and can be reduced by as much as 40% after ten years; however, it never returns to that of people who have never smoked.(10)  The risk of other cancers such as those of the  mouth ,  throat ,  esophagus ,  bladder, kidney , and  pancreas  also decreases after several years of abstinence.(2)  After nearly fifteen years of abstinence, the overall risk of mortality tends to approach a level similar to that of lifelong nonsmokers.(7)  Unfortunately, quitting does not reverse  chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) , but it does slow its progression.(2)  For women who stop smoking before  pregnancy  or during the first trimester, the risk of having a  low-birth-weight baby  is decreased.(2)  Because the reversibility of the risks of smoking is greatly influenced by the duration of smoking prior to quitting, smokers should be encouraged to quit as soon as possible.(11)      Social Pressure:  The increasing social pressure from tobacco control efforts may motivate smokers to quit. For example, workplace and public space restrictions -- including recent bans or proposed bans on smoking in restaurants and bars in many locations -- can increase the motivation or stimulus to quit.   The institution of totally smoke-free workplaces can motivate some people to quit smoking. A recent combined analysis of 26 studies showed that smoke-free workplaces encourage smokers to either quit or decrease their smoking, thus reducing total cigarette consumption per employee by an average of 29%.(12)    Anti-tobacco campaigns and anti-smoking messages in the media can also provide some much-needed motivation and may cause smokers to worry about the effect of smoking on their family's health and well-being.(13)  Parents who smoke may be motivated to try to quit when they learn that exposure to tobacco smoke in the environment is harmful to the health of their children or another loved one. In addition, it is well known that children of parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers themselves. Fortunately, if a parent quits while a child is young, that child has a lower chance of becoming a smoker than if the parent continues to smoke.(14)      Personal Requests:  Many smokers receive personal requests to quit from family members, friends, and physicians who are concerned about the smoker's health and/or are bothered by their habit. Although one request may not be enough motivation, each subsequent request may increase a smoker's probability of quitting.     Economic Aspects:  Although health is usually the main motivator for quitting, the economic cost and burden of the habit may also influence some smokers' decisions. Depending on the individual, smoking can be quite expensive -- costing as much as $70.00-80.00 per week. Recently, many states have increased cigarette taxes, raising the cost of a pack of cigarettes by more than a dollar in some areas. (In New York City, the combination of city and state taxes increases the cost of cigarettes by almost three dollars a pack.) Although the main public health objective of raising the price of cigarettes is to deter adolescents from smoking, increasing cigarette prices does seem to increase smoking cessation.(15)  The economic benefits of quitting may be especially important for the 30% of smokers who have incomes below the national poverty level.(1)    The cost of cigarettes isn't the only economic cost of smoking. Smokers' health care expenses are as much as 21% higher than those of nonsmokers.(16)  It is estimated that smoking costs the U.S. $158 billion each year in productivity losses and excess medical expenditures.(17)        barriers to quitting   So, exactly how hard is it to quit smoking? The answer to this question differs among individuals. Success in quitting is related to personal characteristics, the length of smoking history, the level of cigarette use, the intensity of  addiction , and the smoking cessation methods utilized. Those smoking more cigarettes for a greater time period may find it more difficult, but by no means impossible, to quit. Some studies show that women find it harder to quit than men do, although the reasons for this are unclear.    There are several common barriers to quitting. While these vary from one individual to the next, major barriers that most smokers can expect to encounter include the following:       Withdrawal :  Probably the greatest barrier to quitting -- and the hardest for smokers to overcome -- is withdrawal. Withdrawal is the body's response to the physical need for nicotine and the psychological need or desire for a cigarette. Immediately after quitting, many smokers will experience headache and dizziness, coughing and sore throat, and hunger.(18)  These symptoms usually last a few days to a week. As cessation progresses, other symptoms can develop, including anger, frustration, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, impatience, insomnia, fatigue, and even intense anxiety and depression.(18)  Also, because of the body's dependence on nicotine, the most common symptom is intense nicotine craving, or the overpowering desire to smoke. The physiological symptoms and psychological desire to smoke are the major factors in relapse (resumption of smoking). The use of nicotine replacement therapies in a smoking cessation program can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal. Physical withdrawal typically peaks at one to three weeks after quitting; ""psychological withdrawal"" and the desire for a cigarette can last anywhere from weeks to a few years, but for most people not much more than six months.     Behavioral Addiction:  Behavioral, or psychological, addiction to or dependence on the practice of smoking may make quitting difficult. Many people associate smoking with other actions or situations such as eating, drinking, and social or stressful events -- associations that are sometimes hard to change. Also, many smokers enjoy the oral activity of smoking a cigarette and the physical comfort of holding it between their fingers.     Social Circumstances:  Another barrier to cessation can be the presence of smokers in the household, workplace, or social or recreational environments. This can deter smokers from trying to quit or provoke smokers to relapse by providing an unsupportive environment or easy access to cigarettes. Many smokers are so-called social smokers; they find it difficult to be in a social environment without smoking.       Fear of weight gain:   Fear of weight gain makes many people hesitant to quit smoking. The truth is that most smokers do gain weight after quitting. The average weight gain is 5 to 10 pounds,(2)  but as many as 10% of people trying to quit will gain more than 30 pounds.(6)  This usually occurs because smokers snack or eat more to compensate for the lack of cigarettes and withdrawal symptoms. Also, many quitters experience an enhanced sense of taste and smell, which may increase the desire to eat. Others need to replace the behavioral aspect of smoking with eating. Smokers must remember that a slight weight gain is not nearly as harmful to health as the hazards from continued smoking. They should not let the fear of temporary weight gain deter them from trying to quit.      Existing Mental Problems:  People with psychiatric disorders, such as  anxiety  or  depression , have higher smoking rates than other people do. It is possible that some of these people smoke to abate the symptoms of these disorders.(19)  Successfully treating the anxiety or depression might increase the likelihood of successful smoking cessation; however, this idea has not yet been evaluated directly.     Difficulties Gaining Access to Treatment:  Some smokers do not have easy or affordable access to smoking cessation treatments. Some smoking cessation products require a prescription, and most are not covered by insurance plans. Increasing the number of over-the-counter medications, reducing the cost of some treatments, and extending insurance coverage should improve cessation outcomes.     Relapse:  The occurrence of relapse is another barrier to cessation. Many smokers who try to quit on their own will suffer a relapse at some point. Those who use drugs or counseling to help them quit have an increased chance of success, but the majority experience some form of relapse. A relapse can set smokers back to the point where they abandon the quest for cessation.       cost effectiveness   Smoking cessation treatment is not integrated into the general U.S. healthcare system at the present time. Few insurance companies and only some Medicaid and state health agencies reimburse for smoking cessation treatments.(16,62)  When coverage is provided, there may be qualifications and limitations -- such as lifetime caps or time constraints -- that may make it difficult to utilize services effectively. Some plans that do cover smoking cessation cover 50% of behavioral services and 100% of nicotine replacement therapy.(63)  Currently, 34 states provide some form of Medicaid coverage for tobacco dependence treatments for low-income smokers, while the remaining states do not.(64)  Many smokers live below the poverty line and have no healthcare coverage whatsoever, making it very difficult to gain access to treatment.   The United Kingdom recently announced that it would reimburse for nicotine replacement products under the National Health Service prescription and will also provide additional benefits for bupropion.(65)  Some think that offering more drug therapies over the counter will result in a higher utilization of these treatments and thus a higher success rate.(66)  Studies show that providing the nicotine patch over the counter doubles quit rates compared to placebo,(6)  and NRTs such as the patch and gum available over the counter have success rates comparable to when they are delivered via prescription.(67)  Most importantly, over the counter status increases the number of smokers who have access to the treatments and the likelihood that they will use the products.   According to healthcare professionals, smoking cessation treatment is the ""gold standard"" of preventive healthcare services.(68)  Given the substantial costs of smoking and its effects on health and healthcare costs, smoking cessation treatment should be encouraged and integrated into the healthcare system.       background -- the magnitude of the problem   Because cigarettes are  addictive , quitting smoking can be difficult, and people who try to quit often fail. Recent surveys show that among current smokers, about 40% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit. But only about 5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently. These numbers look rather dismal, don't they? Actually, though, the situation is not quite that bad. The likelihood that a person will quit smoking successfully increases with each attempt to quit. After several tries, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. More than 45 million Americans have stopped smoking.    More than 46 million American adults currently smoke, and the number of adolescent smokers is increasing annually.(1)  Cigarette smoking contributes to more than 430,000 deaths in the United States each year. Tobacco dependence is now recognized as a clinical addiction and even as a chronic disease -- one of the most widespread in the world.   Quitting smoking has major health benefits. In the long term, smoking cessation reduces the risk of  lung cancer  and other  cancers ,  stroke ,  heart disease ,  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) , and a host of other diseases. In the short term, quitting has some immediate health benefits such as reducing fatigue and shortness of breath and increasing arterial circulation and libido.(2)    Recent U.S. surveys show that among current smokers, nearly 41% had attempted to quit at least once in the previous year, and nearly 70% want to quit.(1)  But only about 4-5% of smokers who try to quit each year succeed in stopping smoking permanently.(1)  The prospects for successful smoking cessation are not as dismal as these numbers seem to indicate, however. The chance of success increases with each quit attempt and with the use of effective smoking cessation methods. After repeated attempts, nearly 40 to 50% of smokers eventually succeed in quitting. Presently, more than 45 million Americans have quit smoking, and the total number of smokers has slowly declined in recent years.(1)    The first smoking cessation programs began in the 1950s, after research had shown that smoking was a serious health hazard. In 1955, public ""stop smoking clinics"" were introduced in Sweden; they used medications, pamphlets, lectures, and physician counseling to help people quit. These clinics spread to the rest of Europe and the United States in the 1960s and have evolved into what are now comprehensive, multi-faceted, individualized programs.   Smoking cessation rates in the United States started to stabilize in the 1990s, after having increased over the prior few decades.(1)  Evidence suggests that this is because the number of quit attempts as well as the success of each attempt stabilized.(3)  However, in 1990, only 10% of quitters used some form of treatment,(4)  whereas as many as 35% do so today.(5)  There are several ways to approach smoking cessation, and individuals must decide for themselves which program or method is right for them. However, the more programs and methods available -- and the more a smoker is educated about quitting -- the greater the likelihood of success.   successful quitter   All smoking cessation programs have at least one thing in common - a flexible notion of what it takes to become a successful quitter. The prerequisites for success vary from individual to individual, but tend to include the following:     Motivation, Desire, Commitment:  Smokers who choose to quit should have strong personal reasons that motivate them to do so. People who attempt to quit solely to please others are usually headed for failure. Successful quitters must make a firm commitment to stop.     Social Support:  Since quitting smoking is incredibly difficult, it is no surprise that support from other people can be helpful in aiding a smoker in quitting. In one study of former adolescent smokers, 8 of the top 11 factors that had helped them to quit smoking involved a form of help from friends and/or family members.(69)   Support  for smoking cessation can come from both close to home (such as friends and relatives), or further away (such as  support groups ,  counselors , or an  online  quitting buddy).      Timing:  The time at which a smoker chooses to quit is very important to the outcome. A quit attempt can temporarily affect a person's lifestyle, state of mind, and general wellbeing. Trying to quit in the midst of an important business deal or a difficult family or personal situation can lower the chances of success.     Choice of Method:  No particular smoking cessation method is right for everyone. However, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) suggests that all smokers trying to quit should use some form of  drug therapy  (such as nicotine replacement therapy or  bupropion ), if possible, in combination with some form of  counseling , behavioral therapy, or social support.  However, not all experts agree that pharmacological agents are needed by all smokers. Smokers should plan ahead and choose the methods that most closely conform to their personal needs. Since some types of medication are only available by prescription, it is a good idea for smokers to discuss their smoking cessation plans with a physician. Physicians can also provide counseling, and they can refer smokers to organized smoking cessation programs in the community.     Repetition:  One of the main keys to successful quitting is repetition. Most smokers will try to quit several times before succeeding. With each attempt, the smoker learns more about what to expect from the quitting process, and the chance of success increases. Many smokers are not aware of this fact and may become needlessly discouraged when they relapse after an initial unsuccessful attempt.   motivators for quitting   Although smokers must make their own decisions to quit, several common factors often serve as motivators for quitting.     Health Benefits:  Improved health seems to be the primary motivator for quitting. Many of the adverse health effects of smoking can be greatly reduced or even reversed through cessation.(2)  Immediate benefits of quitting include a decrease in blood pressure, a lowered pulse rate, an increased oxygen level in the blood, and a decreased blood carbon monoxide level.(7)  Also, the ability to smell and taste is enhanced. After two weeks of abstinence, circulation to the extremities improves, blood pressure remains lower, and lung function improves. After just a few weeks to a month, cough, sinus congestion, fatigue, and shortness of breath all decrease, although cough may actually worsen right after quitting. Further, ex-smokers are less likely than current smokers to have colds, develop  gum disease , experience fertility problems (in both  males  and  females ), or experience  erectile dysfunction .   Long-term benefits may also motivate smokers to quit. One year after quitting, the risk of developing symptomatic coronary artery disease (e.g., angina) is reduced by nearly half compared to those who continue to smoke.(7,8)  And after as little as two to five years, that risk can be decreased to levels approaching those who have never smoked.(8,9)  After five years of abstinence, the risk of  stroke  is reduced, approaching that of people who have never smoked. The risk of  lung cancer  decreases with the number of years of abstinence and can be reduced by as much as 40% after ten years; however, it never returns to that of people who have never smoked.(10)  The risk of other cancers such as those of the  mouth ,  throat ,  esophagus ,  bladder, kidney , and  pancreas  also decreases after several years of abstinence.(2)  After nearly fifteen years of abstinence, the overall risk of mortality tends to approach a level similar to that of lifelong nonsmokers.(7)  Unfortunately, quitting does not reverse  chronic obstructive lung disease (chronic bronchitis or emphysema) , but it does slow its progression.(2)  For women who stop smoking before  pregnancy  or during the first trimester, the risk of having a  low-birth-weight baby  is decreased.(2)  Because the reversibility of the risks of smoking is greatly influenced by the duration of smoking prior to quitting, smokers should be encouraged to quit as soon as possible.(11)      Social Pressure:  The increasing social pressure from tobacco control efforts may motivate smokers to quit. For example, workplace and public space restrictions -- including recent bans or proposed bans on smoking in restaurants and bars in many locations -- can increase the motivation or stimulus to quit.   The institution of totally smoke-free workplaces can motivate some people to quit smoking. A recent combined analysis of 26 studies showed that smoke-free workplaces encourage smokers to either quit or decrease their smoking, thus reducing total cigarette consumption per employee by an average of 29%.(12)    Anti-tobacco campaigns and anti-smoking messages in the media can also provide some much-needed motivation and may cause smokers to worry about the effect of smoking on their family's health and well-being.(13)  Parents who smoke may be motivated to try to quit when they learn that exposure to tobacco smoke in the environment is harmful to the health of their children or another loved one. In addition, it is well known that children of parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers themselves. Fortunately, if a parent quits while a child is young, that child has a lower chance of becoming a smoker than if the parent continues to smoke.(14)      Personal Requests:  Many smokers receive personal requests to quit from family members, friends, and physicians who are concerned about the smoker's health and/or are bothered by their habit. Although one request may not be enough motivation, each subsequent request may increase a smoker's probability of quitting.

""After                                       years of trying to quit smoking I tried                                       your Quit Smoking Right Now Program.

I smoked, like                       a champion, for all but 10 of my 49 years of living. By the time I finally quit                       last year, I could hardly crawl up a flight of stairs without                       being barely able to catch my breath. Last year I had                       developed a smokers cough so bad that during a hacking fit                       I actually tore a chest muscle. Just a few weeks prior to                       quitting I began waking up in the middle of the night,                       gasping for breath. I had to borrow a friends asthma puffer.                       My teeth were a sickening yellow, my eyes disgustingly dull,                       my skin that ungodly grayish color that branded me ""a                       smoker"" and I always seemed to be the only one at                       social gatherings having to hide somewhere just to                       steal a few puffs. I had tried valiantly to quit twice before,                       but failed miserably.                                                                                                             The                               Tobacco Industry kills more people in North                               America from Monday to Thursday of each week than                               the terrorists murdered in total on Sept. 11, 2001                               Some                               family members and friends had started almost                               pleading with me to 'save my own life' but I was                               totally convinced that after failing to quit                               before, I was a lifelong 'nicotine                               addict' - and would probably be sucking on a                               cigarette with my dying breath. The way I had                               started to feel last year, it seemed like it wouldn't take too                               much longer.                                 In fact, these are                               the untouched words of my eldest daughter, a                               registered nurse, who was the MOST surprised of                               anyone that I had  really  quit smoking for                               good: ""Dad, you know how much I wanted you to quit                               smoking for a long time but especially after the                               birth of Corbin and Cameron. I couldn't be more                               proud of you, and happy for my sons, that their                               grandfather will now be around a lot longer to be a                               great influence in their lives.""  Sara                               N. Wilson RN                                                                                                       Well, this was                       Beneteau - the Smoker, just last year. Coughing, hacking,                       gasping for breath with everyone griping at him to ""just be a                       man and quit!"" But despite even this pressure and how                       bad my health was becoming, another attempt at quitting was not even close to                       being on my radar screen. Ahhh, the seductive power of                       puffing!!                                                                        A Chance Meeting                         In 2003, I met a                       man named  Rick                       Saruna . At the time, I had been looking for a local practitioner of                       NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) and relaxation therapy to help a                       relative of mine through a difficult time. I came across                       Rick and his clinic in my hometown of Windsor, Ontario.                      If you want to                       know the entire truth, Rick was flabbergasted when I                       called the first time as a few weeks prior he had written  my                        name down to contact me after buying a book at a                       conference he had attended in New Hampshire -  my                       company was listed in the book's resource section. So we                       had 2 reasons to meet.                         We met a few                       days later at his clinic and discussed a plan of action                       for my loved one. I noticed that a large part of his                       practice was devoted to helping people quit smoking and he                       claimed a 90% success rate. Knowing what I knew then about                       the horror stories of myself and others who tried to quit                       smoking, I was quite skeptical of this claim. Making one                       of my notoriously off-handed remarks, I commented about my                       being in the 10% -  the stereotypical, weak-minded,                       incurable addict.                         Rick replied SO                       matter-of-factly that the 10% who failed to quit represented those who                       didn't follow his simple program and that in a couple of hours he                       could get me to give up smoking for good!                      He added                       though that this time, I would quit  for good ,                         without  major stress and                         without  suffering through weeks or months of painful cravings and                       withdrawals (that eventually led to my failure before) and                   * without  gaining any extra weight                   whatsoever. In fact he said I would lose weight with his                   program if I wanted to!                         Sure I                       would:-)                                                                                                                                     90%                               of lung cancer occurs in those who have smoked.                               Each package delivers the equivalent of one chest                               x-ray.                                                               Look,                               I wasn't even close to thinking about making yet                               another                               mother-of-all-painful-decisions-to-quit-smoking,                               so Saruna's promise would have been an absolute                               miracle in my case! All he said I had to do to was                               set aside 3 hours of my time and pick the date for                               what I now call                               ""D-Day"", or ""done                               day"". I did just that. Afterall, what                               could having at least a semi-open mind and                               investing 3 hours really cost me in the bigger                               scheme of things?                                                                                                                                                           After                     3 hours, I really did Quit!                       My 9:00 a.m. session with                     Rick lasted 3 hours.                        As an early                     riser I had already been up for 5 hours when I arrived - without a                     cigarette - and I was not in a great                     mood. I believe in the power                     of the mind and all, but at this point I just 'knew what I                     knew' about cigarette addiction and it just felt like this                     exercise would be one of total futility. Actually, I saw myself taking a break to light up                     outside just as soon as I could:-)                       Maybe this is how                     you feel right now. Doubtful? Even skeptical? If that's                     true, I encourage you to                     please, please read on. Everything changed VERY quickly for me from                     this point forward!                     See, I made a commitment to                   at least have an open mind,                     the very same kind of commitment I will be asking you to make                     here, so I started listening to what Rick began telling me - the real truth about my                   addiction to tobacco.                       Everything                     he said soon made a whole lot of sense - including why                     it would be very easy for me to finally quit smoking this                     time.                       You are about to                     read just some of what I was shocked to learn. Afterall, it   IS  these ""truths"" that make the                     difference between smokers being able to quit, and not. And just so you know, I shook my head in                     disbelief at some of these the first time I heard them!                                                                   The Real Deal about Smoking                     and WHY You Can Quit Easily Too!                                                                                                                                                                                   Smoking                             cigarettes is   NOT  a natural or pleasurable thing to                             do. The body rejects it, ie: hack, cough, spit and                             did someone say, horrible taste? Your body tells you                             this is really bad stuff! However, I must have said                             a thousand times, ""I enjoy smoking"" or                             ""that cigarette will taste good right after                             dinner"", but that was because  they   (the                             Tobacco Industry) made                             me believe smoking cigarettes was a natural and                             pleasurable thing to do. What I soon learned was                             that   I really love NOT SMOKING!  You know, lungs full of clean air, tons more energy, no                             shortness of breath, nice bright white teeth,                             increased mental clarity, the amazing taste of foods, a more radiant                             complexion and increased self-esteem simply because                             of being victorious in the war of tobacco addiction!                                                                                                                                           It was  your                             mind  that convinced your body to start smoking                             in the first place so you could look cool/be                             accepted/whatever reason your mind came up with, and                             it is    only      your mind   that can convince                             your body to stop. This  IS  the focal                             point of our program and the reason it really works.                             No other program I am aware of takes  your belief                             system , the most important ingredient in the                             successful quit smoking equation, into consideration                             - hence the staggering failure rate of theirs and                             the  90% success of ours!                                                                                                                                              Here is                             something that has got to shock you - nicotine is  not                              what you are mainly addicted to in cigarettes! The tobacco                             companies and even the government and health care industry                             would have you believe this is true but there is another                             ingredient in the highly guarded, patent protected                             list (imagine that, it's the public's health at                             stake and this is a trade secret!) among  the                             1000's of chemicals  in each cigarette that  really  is the one                             responsible for your addiction - and - the terrible                             struggle for most people to quit. In our program we                             reveal this ingredient (it will amaze you!) and more                             importantly, we teach you how to control and easily                             counteract your addiction to this substance - a                             simple and painless thing to do.                                                                                                                                           While                             every other quit smoking program is                             focused on helping you fight off false cravings for                             nicotine, hundreds of thousands of people who are sincere about quitting are                             sadly spending millions of                             dollars buying up expensive pills, patches, inhalers,                             supplements and gums in a losing battle to save their own lives. Therefore,                              both  the smoking   and  the                             quit-smoking (pharmaceutical) industries (did                             someone say among the largest government lobbies in                             the U.S.?) are raking in billions and billions!                                                                                                                                           The main reason                             people fail to quit (and why it took almost 40 years of                             smoking for me to learn this) is that from the time we were                             little children we have been lied to and literally                             programmed by the powerful tobacco and                             pharmaceutical industries as well as the media to                             believe that we are heavily addicted and cannot quit. Between having you keep                             smoking, and, keep quitting, they have a vested                             interest in keeping you as a dying, sorry I mean paying,                             customer. Not a laughing matter at all but I                             couldn't resist.                                                                                                                     Believe me, no matter how                     strange or ""conspirial"" the above might seem to you                     right now, this will ALL  make total sense  when you experience just                     how easy it is to quit smoking using  The Quit Smoking                     Right Now Program .                                                                    In other words   . . . the proof is                     in the quitting!

One thing I                             know is that not everybody is motivated by the same                             things. One person may be motivated by the fact they                             might  add years to their life  while another may be                             scared by the grim statistics and horrible death                             that so many smokers ultimately face. Still others may be                             motivated by how much money they will save by                             quitting smoking. So, let's spend a few seconds                             talking about saving those thousands of                             dollars.                                                                                                                                        Smoking                     and Stopping Co$T You!                       Here's the money                     you will spend if you continue smoking (and of                     course the price of smoking never goes down). Incidentally,                     with what I am saving on cigarettes, I can take an all                     expense paid vacation for 2 to an exotic island every year!

Consider                 the 1990 Surgeon                     General's Report findings:                                                                                                                       When                             it comes                                right                             down to it,                               aren't                             you tired of                               being                             a slave                               to                             cigarettes?                                                                               After 1 year off                     cigarettes, the excess risk of heart disease and sudden                     death caused by smoking is  reduced by half . After 15                     years of abstinence, the risk of heart disease is similar to                     that of people who've never smoked.                       In 5 to 15                     years, the risk of stroke for ex-smokers returns to the                     level of those who've  never smoked .                       Male smokers who                     quit between ages 35 to 39 can add up to  15 years  to                     their life. Female quitters in this age group can add up to  12                     years . Men and women who quit at ages 65 to 69 increase                     their life expectancy by up to  3 years .                                                                                                                                         And here are some                   amazing facts   about the health benefits you can receive even 20 minutes after quitting.                   It really doesn't                 matter whose stats you read or believe the bottom line for most                 people is the                 same:                    Quitting smoking will probably extend the length and                 definitely improve the                 quality of your life and those around you!                                                                                                                          I believe                         it must also be said that as with all things in life, there                         are exceptions to the normal health issues associated                         with smoking. My aunt smoked almost her entire adult                         life and lived to be 89 years old. A friend of mine's                         close friend drank several martinis while chain smoking                         every day and lived to be 96. Rare cases such as these                         continue to baffle scientists.                                                                                                                                                                        Our                     90% Success Rate, Our 100% Promise!                   Now that I have                 experienced just how easy it really was for a die-hard smoker                 like me to quit, I can see why  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program   can proudly boast a 90%                 success rate. In fact, I wondered why it wasn't higher! But                 again, Rick                 explains this as a simple example of human nature, in that 10%                 of his clients just do not follow the simple steps of his                 program. If they did, he could probably claim a 100% success rate.                       So, for any customer                 who falls into this category and for whatever reason doesn't                 quit smoking in the first pass, we have a fail-safe back-up plan. We will                 send in the reinforcements and come to their rescue.   Our                     promise, and our mission,                 is to have you quit smoking - for Life!                                           What                     would it be worth to you to Take Back Your Life?                       What would the                             freedom of being tobacco-free for the rest of your                             life be worth to you? Interesting question,                     considering the claim we make here, don't you agree?                        In my case, and in all sincerity, I cannot put a                     price on my new found freedom. Neither can my daughters and my mother and my                     siblings and my friends. I feel GREAT physically and I feel                             GREAT spiritually because I quit. This, and the fact                     that it was so easy for me to quit for good was the entire reason                     I decided to stop everything else I was doing to ask Rick Saruna to help me put his program and this                             amazing product together. So, my answer to this                             question is,                     well,  priceless .                       I'm quite sure                     the people whose testimonials you've read who quit smoking                     using  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program , or the hundreds who have                     quit with the clinic program, would feel just as I do.     Speaking of                     which, in his clinic                     practice, Rick's retail price for this program is $800.00.                     Sometimes he has a special promotion where the price                     is reduced to $500.00.                     Thing is, you would not have a personal session with Rick with our digital product   but you also won't have to wait weeks                     for an appointment (my 2 day appt. time was partially                     business and not normal practice for his clinic) - you                     receive everything you would during that session either in                     written or audio form within hours. Plus, you can get  personal help                     by email and  ** even by phone if you require it.                       We also researched and found a wide range of prices for                     stop smoking programs.                     Many cost thousands of dollars and included 'medicines' such                     as the patch, pills, inhalers or gums, and/or supplements,                     all of which are very expensive. You read the approximate                     costs of some of the quit-industry pharmaceutical products a few minutes ago.                       We also had to                     consider that unlike the corner drug store who would not                     likely ever refund you hundreds of dollars on empty packages of                     Nicorettes or a Nicotrol inhaler because you claimed they                     didn't work,   we will refund you every penny  you paid                     us if you don't quit. You will                     soon read this in our 100% money-back guarantee.                       Also, unlike                     most programs that would not likely continue to support you in your quest to quit                     smoking for good after you have paid the price and completed                     the course,  we will !                       Ok, just one                     more thing. Rick and I spent                     the latter part of 2003 and the first part of 2004 putting  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  together. Between his                     grueling clinic schedule and my crazy Internet hours, a lot                     of 'midnight oil' was burned in order to be able to present                     this amazing program to you. We also decided to have the                     audio portion of this program recorded in a professional                     recording studio, so no ""teleconference or                     headset-to-PC"" quality                     files here:-) Plus, we added some custom-written and                     produced music just to make you feel more                     ""energized"" from the moment you begin to Quit Smoking.                       Mostly though,                     we decided  The                     Quit Smoking Right Now Program  had to be priced fairly                     and within easy financial reach of every smoker,                     considering what every smoker pays right now for cigarettes                     every day, or, for all the costs associated with all the                     other quit-smoking programs and expensive pharmaceuticals                     and supplements out there.                        So, our  Special                     Introductory Price  to                     have  You Take Your Life Back  by guaranteeing that   You                     Will Quit Smoking Once and for All , is only  $197.00 , or the price of                     your supply of cigarettes at 2 packs a day for a single                     month. That's it!                                                                  I Want To Take Back My Life Right Now!                                                                   The                     Ultimate 'Stress Test'                                     I struggled with                 whether to include the following information in a sales                 presentation because it is based on very personal information                 but I decided that in the end, my desire to help you or a loved                 to quit smoking won out.                    The last part of                 2003 and the beginning of 2004 was very stressful for me. My                 mother was hospitalized for 3 long months with appendicitis, a                 broken foot from falling down when the rupture occurred and                 complications resulting from the toxins being released into her                 80+ year-old body. My youngest daughter was also hospitalized                 having had her normal round of                 seizures, which are always very nasty and physically damaging to                 her. Finally, my elderly aunt, who I had taken care of since                 1993, had fallen and had been alone on the floor for 2 1/2 days                 when I discovered her. Different hospitals all, of course.                   I am a                 ""lifeline"" of sorts to all 3 of my loved ones here and                 although I feel I have fairly broad shoulders, I could not begin                 to explain the level of stress I came to experience dealing with                 the intricacies of, and time associated with, each crucial                 situation. You know, daily visitations, doctor consults,                 specialist appointments, rehab appointments, discharge planner                 appointments etc., and ultimately with my aunt, the long process of                 having to select a nursing home and related services (dozens of                 phonecalls and meetings) etc.                   In January, my                 mother was thankfully released but my daughter was hospitalized                 again and                 then my aunt suffered a massive                 stroke just hours from being                 transported to the nursing home that I and her step daughter                 carefully chose for her, and near the end it became a matter of my                 almost living in the hospital. She passed peacefully on                 Feb. 1, 2004.                    If there ever was a                 time when logic and stress would seemingly dictate that a                 recently-quit smoker would slip up and start smoking again, believe me, it                 would have been anytime during these months! But I can                 honestly tell you that although I had fleeting thoughts of joining                 the few smokers I saw huddled outside the hospital in                 the bitter cold, I never even came close to                 acting upon them. Truth is, based on what I learned in  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program , I simply cannot see a                 circumstance under which I would ever go back to smoking                 cigarettes!                    Believe me, before these stressful                 months, I was totally                 convinced of the effectiveness of  The Quit                     Smoking Right Now Program   but while putting the finishing touches                 on this letter I realized just how awesome and truly                 powerful this program really is!                   Now, here's the                 bottom line for you  . . .

Contrary to many claims from hypnotherapists it does require some will-power and motivation. However it is proven that with hypnotherapy you are at least  five to fifteen times more likely to succeed than by willpower alone.                         Imagine a life as a non-smoker...                                                    Better health and a longer life                           More freedom (and more money!)                           More energy and confidence                           No more worries about what you are doing to your body!                           Increased libido!                           Younger looking skin                           More in control of your life (more professional and social opportunities too!)                            You will smell great (at last!)                           Your body clear of poisonous toxins like nicotine                                                                          Tired of being ""controlled"" by smoking? Nicotine: a powerful neuro-stimulant                          When you smoke your heart rate soars and your whole nervous system is stimulated into greater agitation. A cigarette gives you a two minute fix of dopamine (brain chemical that feels good) combined with 48 hours of an agitated nervous system. You keep going back for that good feeling to counteract the agitation.... only to increase the agitation. Cigarettes hold out a promise of relaxation that they NEVER deliver!                                                ""It feels wonderful to be free of cigarettes after years of trying...""                          In these  Stop Smoking Sessions  we use the most powerful techniques available to ensure you get the best chance to quit you will ever receive. We don't take a cookie-cutter approach that relies on one technique. Instead we use a whole range of techniques to create a unique treatment session for you.                                                  These methods are individually proven in research studies to be the most effective ways to stop smoking and are broadly based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Clinical Hypnotherapy. Each technique on it’s own could be 100% effective for you—however as one can never tell exactly which approach will “click” with a client we use several techniques in a powerful combination.                                                  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)                          Of all psychotherapies CBT has the strongest evidential backing and is now the treatment of choice under the NHS. CBT aims to change thoughts and behaviours to bring about positive changes.                                                Clinical Hypnotherapy                           Clinical hypnotherapy  works by taking you into a state of heightened suggestibility where your critical mind takes a break and we can work directly and deeply with your imagination and subconscious to create new beliefs, patterns and habits. (Read more about hypnotherapy here.)                                                 CBT & Hypnotherapy combined                          Research studies where  CBT and hypnotherapy  are applied together have shown that they are strongly complementary and their effectiveness is raised many times when used in combination.                                                                           Individual and Group Programmes available                                                   Read on for information about Individual sessions.                                                                        What Happens in a Session?                                                   First we have a phone interview to assess your habit and motivation. If I don’t think your motivation is strong enough or if you have a lot of current stress in your life (for example a recent divorce) I will not recommend we proceed at that time as I don’t want you wasting your money and effort. Providing your motivation is good I’ll give you some ways to prepare to stop and we’ll meet a week later.                        The actual session lasts 2 hours – during that time we’ll review your habit and motivations in depth. I’ll then use a whole package of techniques to dismantle your habit—basically we throw the book at it! And remember it only needs one of these techniques to work for you to stop. This session includes working deeply with your subconscious in hypnosis, giving you the skills, belief structure and deep inspiration to stop smoking immediately.                         I’ll train you in the session to ensure that you have the skills you need to remain a non-smoker. I also give you several “last-resort” tools that you can use during challenging moments in the weeks following, including self-hypnosis CD’s and phone support.                                                  Most people require only one session which is a specially extended session lasting approximately two hours - and is tailor-made to your needs. The session is uplifting, very inspiring and deeply relaxing.                                                   ""But I've tried to stop so many times!""                           No problem. In fact there is good evidence to show that the number of failed attempts to  stop smoking  is a good predictor of final success.                                                                                                Smoking Cessation                         Success Rates                         'Hypnosis is the most effective way of giving up smoking, according to the largest ever scientific comparison of ways of breaking the habit.' - New Scientist v136                                                    In 1992  New Scientist Magazine  published the results of an extensive clinical study on the most effective  smoking cessation  methods. A meta-analysis, statistically combining the results of more than 600 studies (over 72,000 individual cases) showed that single session hypnosis increased a smoker's success chance by 1000% from 6% to 60%. Here are the success rates for different smoking cessation methods:                         60% - Single session Hypnosis                          24% - Acupuncture                          10% - Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)                          6% - Willpower alone                                                    These impressive figures are for hypnosis alone - and include many hypnotherapists using hypnosis alone and often antiquated methods. Using modern clinical hypnotherapy combined with cognitive behavioural therapy these results will improve considerably.                         Interestingly the latest research on NRT (see "" NRT hyped "" on BBC website) shows a success rate of only 7.2%, barely better than willpower alone! Yet NRT is the currently recommended treatment for smoking cessation under the NHS.                          It's never to late too quit!                                                  It's never too late to  quit smoking . According to the American Cancer Society, about half of all smokers who keep smoking will die from a smoking-related disease. Quitting has immediate health benefits. .

Thursday, June 26, 2008         How to Quit Smoking Even if You Love to Smoke        Let's face it, you probably enjoy some aspects of smoking. Some     people truly love to smoke. There's no denying that smoking     provides real benefits such as relaxation or feelings of     security.         So, how do you quit when you love to smoke?         YOU GOTTA WANNA         First and foremost, you have to have the desire to quit. If you     love smoking and don't want or plan to quit, then there's almost     no point in reading further. But if you honestly do want to     quit, then you have the first and most important ingredient for     quitting.         Is it possible to love smoking while simultaneously wanting to     quit? Of course! Think about any destructive behavior you or     other people engage in. For example, you may love to speed when     you drive around town, yet you know it is dangerous and you want     to quit doing it. Alcoholics have a love-hate relationship with     their drink. You smoke and enjoy it, but you know it is bad for     you.         DEVELOP THE DESIRE TO QUIT         ""I love smoking too much to develop the desire to quit,"" you may     be saying. However, there are some simple steps you can take to     create the will to quit.         1. Make a list of the benefits you receive from smoking. Write     down as many benefits as you can think of.         2. Make a list of the bad things that have resulted or may     result from continuing to smoke.         3. Make a list of the reasons YOU want to quit. For example,     your list might include ""live longer"", ""set a good example for     my children"", ""save money"", etc. Everyone needs a purpose or a     reason to do anything before he or she is truly motivated to do     it. Make sure you know why you want to quit.         Read each of your lists at least once per day. These lists will     provide you with concrete motivation for quitting.         4. Make an appointment with your doctor and ask him or her to be     very frank with you about the destructiveness of smoking. Ask to     see pictures of lungs taken out of smokers' bodies. Have your     doctor explain what good things will happen after you quit.     Hearing and seeing these things from your doctor may influence     you more than anything else. After all, this person has devoted     their life to understanding the human body. They know the     truth, and most likely you'll believe what they have to say.         EXAMINE THE ""BENEFITS""         Once you have a definite desire to  quit smoking , it's time to     examine the so-called ""benefits"" of smoking. By now you should     have the ""benefits of smoking"" list that you made in step 1     above.         You must become very objective when you analyze your list. Is     each list item truly a benefit or just a ""fix"". If you smoke to     relax, ask yourself ""how does a non-smoker deal with stress     without smoking?"" If you smoke to relieve boredom are you     benefiting yourself temporarily by smoking, while paying for it     with reduced health and expensive cigarettes?         Look at each item in your list from the perspective of a non-     smoker. What would a non-smoker have to say about your list? How     does a non-smoker deal with the world without smoking? Can you     obtain the same or similar benefits without a cigarette?         Remember that much of the ""positive"" benefit of smoking is     temporary. The long-term effects of smoking are nearly all     negative.         FIND REPLACEMENTS         After examining the benefits you get from smoking, you need to     develop replacements for your cigarettes (and their effects) so     that you can continue to receive the benefits that smoking     provides you, but without the downside.         First, you need to understand that some of the so-called     benefits of smoking are really just a cruel lie. As your body     has grown accustomed to smoking and the accompanying physical     and chemical effects on your body, you have developed a need to     smoke to achieve these ""benefits."" You feel that the only way     you can relax is to smoke, and you do find that smoking calms     your nerves. But how long has it been since you relaxed on your     own, without the aid of a cigarette? Again, how does a non-     smoker relax? Smoking has become your crutch, when your ankle     really isn't broken.         So, on your list of ""benefits of smoking"" next to each benefit,     write down something you can do, other than smoking, that will     replicate the benefit.         For example, if the benefit you wrote down was that smoking     helps you sleep, you might write down that you would exercise     regularly. Exercise can aid your body in so many ways, including     better sleep. If you wrote that smoking helps you to get moving     in the morning, you might write down that you will listen to     your favorite high-energy music while you get dressed.         Be creative! This is the fun part. You get to re-invent your     life!         TURN LOVE TO DISGUST         If you love to smoke, you need to begin to despise it.         Switch to a different brand of cigarettes--one that you don't     like.         Look at yourself in the mirror when you smoke. Looks stupid,     doesn't it? No other animal in the world, even the lowliest,     purposefully inhales smoke. Why do you?         Look at your hands and teeth. They're disgusting, aren't they?     You're not going to get a date looking like that!         And you stink too! Yuck!         The cigarette companies are robbing you of $1,000 per year. Are     you going to let them get away with that? And your car smells     terrible. You won't be able to get as much for it when you sell     it.         You're a social outcast at restaurants. Nobody likes to smell     your stinky smoke.         Get the idea?         NOW GO OUT AND DO IT         You can read this and do nothing or you can follow the steps and     take ACTION! Nothing in your life worth doing happens magically.     You have to create your own magic by taking action. Action.     ACTION.
