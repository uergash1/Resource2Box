ROI can set up and run    google adwords   campaigns on your behalf. This type  of marketing is ideal for those  wanting to achieve a high position  on search engine returned results as  you can sponsor keywords and phrases  that will attract people to your  website. Depending on how much you  can achieve a 1st page return. The  downside is that it can become  costly in a competitive business  sector such as    domain name  registration .        Affiliate programs are another ideal  way of generating revenue. You can  either join an affiliate program  whereby you place links on your  website to other peoples and receive  payment should your visitor purchase  anything.    Alternatively you can create your  own affiliate program and get other  website owners to place links to  your site. You then pay the referrer  a commission should the visitor  purchase anything from you.    ROI Designs can install such a  program onto your website very  quickly.

Obsessions are irrational, unwanted, persistent thoughts or images. They are not voluntary and are events that invade a sufferer's consciousness. They can be worrying, repulsive, obscene and blasphemous. They cause immense anxiety and cannot be controlled. Obsessing over germs and dirt, having things in a particular order and nagging doubts are common with this disorder. Persistent thoughts of performing sexual acts that are repulsive and thoughts that go against any religious beliefs are also common.    Those who experience OCD may engage in certain rituals, or compulsions, which relieve or minimise anxiety for a period of time. The compulsions are repeated continuously and include hand washing, counting and touching things, constant rules to follow to satisfy doubts and incessant rechecking.   Such activities are performed for at least an hour a day and can significantly interfere with normal daily routines and relationships. Whereas most adults recognise what they are doing is irrational, children may not realise their behaviour is not normal. Research has found that OCD usually appears in childhood or adolescence and symptoms may come and go, ease over time or get steadily worse.   Other anxiety disorders that can accompany OCD are  depression,   eating disorders  and  drug or alcohol abuse.  However, the disorder can often be treated.     Symptoms:     Persistant unwanted thoughts  Obsessions with germs and dirt  Obsessions with order and counting  Obsessions with touching  Chronic worrying  Irritability  Loss of concentration  Trouble sleeping   Causes     Medical Help and Treatment    Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Statistics:    More Statistics >>   Around 1.2 per cent of the population of Britain have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) at any one time, according to the ONS survey. Other studies suggest that up to 3 per cent of the population will experience OCD at some time in their lives a much higher lifetime prevalence than has been previously assumed.     [24]      It appears that studies are divided over whether this is more common for women: the ONS survey gives a female to male ratio of 15:9, whereas other studies have suggested no clear gender difference in diagnostic rates for OCD.

Hugh Stewart House (warden's residence, adjoining the hall)       This is a list of  halls of residence  on the various  campuses of the University of Nottingham  in  Nottingham ,  England .   The  University of Nottingham  has a particularly well developed system of halls, often referred to as a 'semi-collegiate' system. [ citation needed ]  The halls acts a microcosms of the university at large and provide a community-level forum for the interaction of undergraduates, postgraduates and senior academics.   The halls are generally named either after counties, districts, or places in the English East Midlands (Nottingham having been originally conceived as a regional university for this area) or significant people associated with the university. Lenton, Lincoln, Derby, Rutland, Sherwood, Newark, Southwell, Ancaster and Melton halls fall into the former category, Hugh Stewart, Cripps, Nightingale, Florence Boot, Wortley, and Willoughby into the latter.

Ancaster Hall  provides accommodation for about 270 students and the current warden is Madam Svenja Adolphs. It was originally a women's hall, but it and Rutland Hall became the University's first mixed halls in 1970.   Cavendish Hall  provides accommodation for about 279 students. The hall is named after the Cavendish family. In 2004, the Warden was Dr M M Daly. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 1997. It is the only fully  en suite  hall on campus.          Cripps Hall - Clock Tower       Cripps Hall  provides accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after its benefactor, Sir Cyril Cripps. It opened in 1959, and was originally all male, but has been mixed sex since 2000. Cripps Hall was designed by the architects  Donald McMorran  and George Whitby, and is a grade II  listed building  (one of only relatively few post-war buildings to be given such status). Cripps Hall has a perennial rivalry with its neighbour, Hugh Stewart Hall. Cripps Hall is the only hall on campus to have its gym and has won the intramural sports competition for the past three years. The current warden is Dr Gethin Roberts.   Derby Hall  provides Accommodation for just over 300 students. The hall is named after the local city of  Derby . The hall, completed in 1963, was designed by the New Zealand architect, Brian O'Rourke, in classical style, around a central quad. An extension block named Matlock was later added, greatly increasing accommodation by adding 96 rooms. The current warden is Professor Charles Watkins.   Florence Boot Hall  provides accommodation for just fewer than 200 students. The hall is named after Florence Boot, the wife of  Jesse Boot, the first Lord Trent , a major benefactor to the University. It was opened in 1928. It was originally all female, but has been mixed sex since 2000. In 2008, the Warden is Gordon Airey.          Hugh Stewart Hall: view across quads       Hugh Stewart Hall  is the largest hall on University Park Campus (the third largest at the University), providing accommodation for around 347 students. The hall is named after Hugh Stewart (18841934) who was Principal of  University College Nottingham  from 1929 until his death. Until 2000 the hall was all male. The oldest part of Hugh Stewart Hall was originally called Lenton Hall, and was built in about 1792, as a home for Nottingham banker and owner of the  Butterley Company , John Wright. The hall was extended in 1937, at which time it was renamed Hugh Stewart. It was extended again in 1969. The Hall's Warden is Ms Stacy Johnson of the School of Nursing who, in September 2005 took over from archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson after he unexpectedly had to resign due to academic commitments, having being warden for only a year. He was preceded by  Dr. Don Rees  who had been Warden of the hall for 29 years, and after whom the hall library is named.   Until June 2006, the hall housed the last remaining student-run bar in the University. Since October 2006, Hugh Stewart Hall has been one of four halls on campus to host an incarnation of ""The Mix"" (a caf/bar hybrid) in place of the former student-run bar.   The hall is built in a mixture of architectural styles, reflecting the mood of the different ages in which it grew. The original Lenton Hall is Georgian-Gothick, the middle section ('old block') is Art Deco, whilst the new block is a stark modernist construct.   Lenton and Wortley Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for just over 300 students, making it the third largest hall on campus. The hall results from the amalgamation of two previous halls of residence, New Lenton Hall and Wortley Hall, named after the local district of  Lenton , and Professor Harry Almond Saville Wortley, Principal of University College Nottingham from 1935 to 1947. The Hall is home to one of the four ""Mix"" cafe-bars on campus. Between 1980 and 2006, the Warden was Mr William Hooker. The current warden is Professor Glenn McDowell.          Lincoln Hall Quad, a view from Coveney Library       Lincoln Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 221 students.

Wooley and opened in 1962; until 1997 it was an all male hall. The buildings overlook parkland at the rear and form two main courts. The rectangular lower court consists of 12 self-contained accommodation blocks, each named after places found in the county of  Lincolnshire . Accommodation is the form of single study rooms, some shared study rooms and others which have private bathrooms between two study rooms. The upper court features the dining hall, the Coveney Library, the Senior Common Room and the gatehouse, all enclosing a circular lawn. Two gilded herons, the Hall's emblem, adorn the wrought iron gates leading to the park. Lincoln has a tradition as the most aesthetically active hall on campus.          Nightingale hall       Nightingale Hall  is the smallest hall of residence on campus with accommodation for 150 students. The hall opened in 1950, and was refurbished in 1998 and again in 2007. It is named after the nursing pioneer  Florence Nightingale , and originally stored the university's collection of documents and memorabilia associated with her, although this is now stored in the  Hallward Library  and the  Florence Nightingale Museum  in Southwark, London. Until 2000 the hall was all female, but it is now mixed. The Hall was one of the first to offer students 'large study bedroom' accommodation in September 2007 in which the rooms are fitted with three-quarter sized beds, and a mini fridge. The present warden is Professor Jan Bradley.          Rutland Hall       Rutland Hall  provides accommodation for 260 students. It is named after both the East Midlands county of Rutland and the  Duke of Rutland  himself. The hall was originally opened in 1964 as part of a large expansion of the university during that period. It was originally a men's hall but it and Ancaster became the University's first mixed halls in 1970. By the 1990s, it was clear that more accommodation was needed. Therefore, in 1993, a new, en suite wing was built  K Block. The building was completely refurbished in the summer of 1999. A particularly notable feature of the building is the unusual shape of its library, which is an octagon.          Sherwood Hall       Sherwood Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence. It provides accommodation for about 267 students. The hall was designed by the architects J Fletcher Watson as part of the 1960s expansion programme on University Park. Building work started in March 1963 and the hall opened, as a male hall of residence, in October 1964.   Sherwood Hall was designed as an interpretation of the traditional collegiate quadrangle, but using contemporary forms and materials. A distinctive feature is the white painted  shiplap   weatherboarding , which gives the hall something of a  North American  feel. As originally built, the hall had a single quadrangle of accommodation blocks, with a further accommodation block and the main hall and library forming a second, but open-ended, court. Subsequent extensions have transformed this into a second quadrangle. For the first twenty-two years of its life, the warden was the late W. R. ""Bunny"" Chalmers. As of 2006 [update]  the current Warden is Dr. Antonino La Rocca.          Willoughby Hall.       Willoughby Hall  is a mixed undergraduate hall of residence.

Newark Hall       Newark Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Newark , sharing its coat of arms and motto ""Deo Fretus Erumpe"" ( ""Trust in God and Sally Forth"" ). Housing about 400 students, this makes it the second largest hall of residence in the University (after Bonington Hall). As the rest of the campus, it was designed by Sir Michael Hopkins in the shape of an eight framing two quads surrounded by the building.   Social life revolves around the Junior Common Room, which is responsible for organizing events for all residents. These tend to take place in the quads or large bar on the ground floor of the building. Formal dinners, hosted by the Warden, are also held at regular intervals throughout the year. Dr Mark Wenman has been warden since 2006.          Southwell Hall       Southwell Hall  is an undergraduate hall of residence named after the local town of  Southwell .

It is a mixed sex hall holding both undergraduates and postgraduates. In reality, it is not really a single Hall, but a number of small separate ""Halls"" of varying age and design, holding between eight and sixty people, in addition to a shared dining room, laundry and bar. Bonington Hall holds approximately 650 students (an additional 300 student rooms having been built in 2006 by Ocon Construction). This makes it the universitys largest hall of residence (regaining the title from Jubilee's Newark hall). The Hall has a JCR committee, but this operates more along the lines of the entertainment committee of the Student Guild as it arranges activities for both the residents of Bonington Hall and those students studying at Sutton Bonington but living off campus. The current Guild president is Ms. Hannah Dugan. The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.

[ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.

The Halls at Sutton Bonington are named after local villages and are as follows:     Kingston (The oldest hall), built just before the First World War and used to house German POWs during the war; until recently it was an all-male hall.   Normanton (originally built as an all-female hall, and remained so until recently, now a postgraduate hall)   Wymeswold   Ratcliffe   Rempstone   Kegworth   Dishley   Hathern   Lockington   Zouch   Stanford   Barton   Everton House (postgraduate-only house at the far end of the arboretum)   St. Michaels Flats (used to house students with families, mainly international students)       [ edit ]   University-arranged self-catering accommodation          One of the buildings in Broadgate Park.       Broadgate Park  is a collection of self catered student accommodation, forming Europe's largest [ citation needed ]  'student village' of some 2400 undergraduate and postgraduate students. It is operated privately by UPP (Broadgate Park) Ltd and is situated adjacent to University park in the area of Beeston. The current Warden is Dr Steve Greedy of the School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering.   Raleigh Park  is a self-catering hall located close to Jubilee Campus, owned and operated by Derwent Living. It consists of five courts: Sillitoe, Madison, Roddice, Byron and Chatterley.

Housing over 160 postgraduate students in Beeston. For the 2008/9 academic year Albion House has been let solely to Nottingham Trent University students.     [ edit ]   Defunct Halls   University Hall  was a hall-grouping to which all off-campus students belonged in the days before such a group became so large that it was meaningless to attempt to make it conform with the halls system. The hall was dissolved in the 1990s.   Wortley Hall  was a hall named after the last Principal of University College Nottingham, Harry Wortley. It was located in the extreme north of University Park in Lenton Firs House. The hall was subsumed by New Lenton Hall in the 1980s, with the School of Architecture (now the School of the Built Environment) taking over the occupation of Lenton Firs.
