Do potential adopters understand the risks of this designer dog?     Most Chiweenie owners will agree that these little dogs can be one of the most loving, intelligent, and adorable companion dogs ever. However, those interested in acquiring a Chiweenie should be aware of the pitfalls.   The Chihuahua/Dachshund cross is sometimes called a designer breed. In reality, it is not a pure breed and does not conform to a breed standard.   The  Chihuahua  Half   The Chihuahua is the smallest breed of dog. Chihuahuas were first discovered in Mexico and are a warm weather breed. Preferring sunlight and warmth, they love to  sunbathe  or tunnel under the covers. For this reason, they also make great lap dogs.   Chihuahuas tend to bond closely with their favorite person or with another Chihuahua and can be very protective for their size. They do not do well when separated from loved ones and may refuse to eat. As with many of the toy breeds, they can suffer from  hypoglycemia.   The Dachshund Half   The Dachshund is recognized as a hound by the AKC and was originally bred for hunting badgers. Their long, low and lean body allows them to tunnel into the badger’s den.   Dachshunds are energetic, courageous, and sometimes protective of their territory or favorite person. They are generally tough little dogs but can suffer from disc disease or disc injury due to the elongated spinal column. Their weight should be carefully controlled.   The Blend   The Chiweenie will likely have characteristics from both parents. They are small dogs and if the Chihuahua was crossed with a miniature Dachshund, this Chiweenie will be even smaller. Most of them inherit the long spinal column of the Dachshund. Some have prick ears and some have floppy ears. The Chiweenie tends to shed very little.   Due to their tiny size, they are easy to scoop up and take almost anywhere. This, and the fact that Chiweenies grow very attached to their owner, makes them a great lap dog and companion dog.   Small dogs are sometimes thought of as ‘yappy’ but Chiweenies are not usually excessively so. They do make great alert dogs and can be a bit protective as well.   These little dogs inherit the desire to ‘tunnel’ from both the Chihuahua and the Dachshund so Chiweenie owners can expect to find their tiny dog burrowed under the covers or snuggled into a pile of laundry still warm from the dryer. With their cold nature, warm clothing and booties are a necessity in winter, even for those quick potty breaks.   Acquiring a Chiweenie   Some dog experts warn that ‘designer dogs’ generally come from breeders that have no interest in breed conformation and seek only to profit from the catchy designer name. They claim that many of these dogs come from  puppy mills  that have more interest in turning a profit than in providing quality housing, food, and vet care for the dogs.   Since inbreeding and early neglect can cause a lifetime of health and behavior issues, it is recommended that those interested in adopting a Chiweenie check with a rescue where all the dogs are evaluated by a veterinarian.   Chiweenie owners who understand their dog and provide proper care can enjoy many years of companionship with this loving pet.

We are considering getting one of my neighbors chiweenie pups, and are looking for negative aspects so we know what we are getting into.

It's great that you're considering this adoption so carefully and if you're comfortable with the dog's background and have it checked by a vet, then a Chiweenie can make a wonderful pet.  I know, because I have an adorable rescued Chiweenie.        Dec 19, 2008 9:21 PM    Guest :    Chiweenies are so cute!!!

When I first got him I was told that he was a chiwawa, but as he has grown over the past month I am really starting to believe he is a chiweenie, and I am so happy he is! He has been extremely easy to potty train, does not need a leash, and is the biggest lover EVER! However, he is a little bossy :)~ Also, I have a 2 year old nephew and they are great together, just keep an eye on the kids, they tend to think the little dog is a toy. If you're thinking of getting one, go for it, they are AWESOME!! Oh y, they love chewing on bones and fetching tennis balls.        Dec 25, 2008 7:55 PM    Guest :    We just got a Chiweenie for Christmas. His momma was a 6 pound weener dog and the Daddy was a tea-cup Chi... He supposedly will be about 3-4 lbs. We are trying to figure out the best way to train him. He seems to like to go outside but in Ohio the winters are so very cold... His new Daddy is my 8 year old son and in just 3 short days he has become very protective and attached to his Daddy.      5 Comments                                                                     Print Article     Email Article     View All Articles     How to subscribe to feeds                             about us   •   limelight blog   •   writing jobs   •   careers   •   press room   •   site map   •   terms & conditions   •   privacy policy   •   suite101.de

                        Rock Art, not rock craft.  Rock art is a form of art, some believe it is a craft because we use a meer                                     stone or rock instead of store bought canvas. Rock Artist put lots of time and skill into each of the pieces                                     we paint.  The pieces on this site are priced as Art not as crafts.  If you are interested in buying a piece                                     of art that will bring you many years of enjoyment then please feel free to browse threw my pages. Each piece is a one                                     of a kind, there are no two rocks that are the same although they may look simular.

These are, in fact, simply mixed breeds that are crossed to produce a specific physical appearance, usually easily identified as a cross between the two breeds. The breeders attempt to include only the desirable traits of the two parents while minimizing the chance of physical or health issues between the cross.                                          Some of the more common or popular designer dogs are:     Labradoodle :  A cross between a Labrador retriever and a Standard Poodle. Considered to have the non-shedding and easy care coat of a poodle combined with the poodle's intelligence and the wonderful, loving personality of the Lab.    Porkie :  A cross between a Pug and a Yorkie. A small dog that is heartier than the standard Yorkie with longer hair and the easygoing temperament of the Pug.    Cockapoo :  A cross between a Cocker Spaniel and a Poodle. Often considered an intelligent, low shedding small breed that is great for families.     Schnoodle :  Cross between a Schnauzer and a Poodle, again with an attempt to have an intelligent, non-shedding companion dog.    Daisy Dog :  A three way cross between a poodle and Shih Tzu parent and a Bichon. These dogs are reported to be very calm and excellent companion dogs for traveling or living in small spaces.    Poogle :  Cross between a Poodle and a Beagle. Small sized dog that energetic and easy to train.    Puggle :  Pug and a Beagle. These are very friendly dogs that love to be involved in all aspects of the family.                                         Most of the designer dogs have a poodle in the mix simply because poodles are know to be excellent non-shedding dogs and also are very intelligent. The three different sizes of poodles also make them a great breed for mixing with various dog breeds.   It is important to remember that these crosses have occurred in the past; it is just now that they are being recognized. As with all breeds of dogs there are good breeding dogs and dogs that should not be crossed due to health conditions or temperaments.   A designer dog, also called a hybrid, is not recognized by the Kennel Clubs, although many agencies are trying to develop registries for these breeds. Be aware that many of these dogs are more expensive than either one of their purebred parents, but do not have any standing with breed registries. Many shelter dogs are mixed breeds that are looking for a loving home and are available at a fraction of the cost that some breeders are asking.   Designer dogs may also have a variety of health concerns and conditions. Do not mistakenly believe that all hybrids are naturally healthy and immune from genetic conditions, in fact they may have just as many health concerns as purebred dogs.

Because of this, MAF has funded hundreds of studies since 1950 to address the causes of pain, suffering and diseases in dogs. Below are just a few examples of how we've improved the health and well-being of dogs.  Learn about our current studies .                                              Canine Cancer Campaign :  MAF launched a major cancer initiative to cure dogs of cancer in 10 to 20 years, or the lifetime of a dog. Efforts include a national tumor tissue bank, a clinical trial for bone cancer treatment, and a long–term prevention study. Visit the  Canine Cancer Campaign  website.               First Parvovirus Vaccine :  Foundation funding supported the development of the first parvovirus vaccine, saving the lives of thousands of dogs.               Diets for Dogs with Kidney Failure :  Early Foundation–funded studies helped define the role of protein and phosphorous in the diet of dogs with kidney failure, helping veterinarians to manage the condition with nutrition. A recent study determined that a daily low dose of calcitriol stabilizes kidney function and slows disease progression.               Tests to Identify Blindness Gene :  Scientists identified the gene for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a group of blinding diseases in dogs. This led to the development of breed–specific DNA tests to help veterinarians and breeders distinguish affected, carrier and normal dogs and breed out these diseases.               Early Lymphoma Detection :  A simple blood test was developed to provide early detection of lymphoma in dogs.               New Drug to Fight Bone Cancer :  Researchers studied a combination of conventional chemotherapy drugs and the drug suramin that appears to provide better treatment than conventional therapy alone and could improve long–term survival of dogs with bone cancer.               Technique to Remove Bladder Stones :  Researchers used a laser lithotripsy technique to remove bladder and urethral stones in dogs. This technique offers veterinarians a minimally invasive alternative to traditional surgery and provides dogs with rapid recovery and minimal discomfort.               Treatment for Heart Abnormalities :  Scientists successfully used radiofrequency catheter ablation to cure dogs with a heart condition known as accessory pathways. Another study used a silicone cuff to treat portosystemic shunts, the second most common congenital cardiovascular abnormality in dogs.
