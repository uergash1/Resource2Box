The USGS Annual Holiday Train Display began in 1989 as a simple LGB layout in front of the Christmas tree set up in the main hallway of the Eastern Mapping Center on the second floor of the USGS National Center.  By 1992 the exhibit had moved to its present location in the main auditorium.  The show now includes operating layouts with HO, S (American Flyer), O (Lionel), and G (LGB).  Many static displays related to railroads are also set up in the auditorium.  Organizations such as the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Operation Lifesaver have provided displays and informational handouts.  The area outside the auditorium has exhibits highlighting the various missions of the USGS science disciplines (geology, geography, hydrography, and biology).  A Community Night includes interactive displays and activities especially for kids.  The train layouts have grown to the point that about 250 labor hours are required to set up and test the operating displays.  A core group of 6-8 volunteers do the set up on the layouts, usually on the weekend before the display opens.  About 10-15 individuals, many from outside USGS, man the exhibit during its four or five day run.  The core USGS volunteers represent Mapping, Geology, and Office of Program Support.  All of the layouts; buildings, track, cars, and locomotives, are owned by individuals who provide them for the display.  The average attendance is about 10,000 during a four-day exhibit.

GX007-81-1358866	Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetlands Monitoring Project     Joseph M. Richards, Hydrologist, Project Chief        The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC)  and the  City of Columbia , Missouri, have initiated a project that is anticipated to be a milestone in the treatment of municipal sewage. As expansion of the Columbia wastewater treatment facility became necessary, constructed treatment wetlands were chosen instead of expanding the existing activated sludge facilities. The significance of the project is that the MDC agreed to accept the treated effluent from the  Columbia wetlands (52K image)  as a water source for managing up to 1,200 wetland acres on the MDC's 4,100-acre  Eagle Bluffs Wildlife Area (64K image),  a restored riverine wetland along the Missouri River.    Objective:      To evaluate changes in surface- and ground-water flow and quality as the    result of the construction of the effluent-wetland treatment system.   Click  here  for more details.    Cooperators:    The Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetland Monitoring Project is jointly funded through cooperative agreements among the Missouri Department of Conservation, the City of Columbia, Missouri, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The study is integrated with other studies operating at the Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetland Complex.      Contact address:    Joseph M.

Study area showing location of Tribal lands, data-collection sites, and major canals and levees. [ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.

Study area showing location of Tribal lands, data-collection sites, and major canals and levees. [ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997.

Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined.

Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management.

[ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.

Since the flood, many local, State,  and Federal agencies have been involved in various aspects of flood recovery.  Late in 1993, representatives from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the White House Office  of Environmental Policy issued a White House directive establishing an  interagency Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team (SAST) to provide  scientific advice and assistance to officials responsible for making decisions about flood recovery in the upper Mississippi River basin. The team developed and provided information to support the decision making process regarding both non-structural (natural floodplains) and structural (levees, dams, dikes) approaches to river basin management.    Specifically, the team compiled and organized information in existing data  bases from a host of Federal, State and local agencies to identify broad areas of the upper Mississippi River and lower Missouri River floodplains, that, from a scientific perspective, are most suitable for assessing alternative flood  control approaches.  It is anticipated that the data base developed also will be useful to states, as well as other Federal agencies to address their specific flood recovery problems and to develop an integrated  flood plain management plan for long-term protection and use of resources  within the flood plains.  The team also produced a series of maps and overlays that show base resource information and vulnerability to flooding.  In  addition, the team is preparing a report documenting the SAST data base, the  products, and the methods used to produce them.   The SAST, comprised of representatives from the Soil Conservation Service,  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National  Biological Survey, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Federal Emergency Management Agency, carried out its activities at the EROS Data Center.   The EROS Data Center was chosen to ""host"" this study because of their unique  experience in data management, image processing, geographic information systems technology, and application of ""geo-spatial"" data to resource management problems.  EDC provided considerable technical assistance to this study with support coming from the Science and Applications Branch, the Data Services  Branch, and the Computer Services Branch.     The Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team continues to collect data and  produce products in support of the interagency Floodplain  Management Review Committee.  These data will be placed in the public domain and made available to other scientists who require them for research and long-term  floodplain monitoring and management.

The USGS has measured floods and supplied streamflow data to the nation for more than 110 years and now has released a new fact sheet listing the most significant floods of the 20th century.  During the 20th century, floods were the number-one disaster in the United States in terms of lives lost and property damage, according to the new fact sheet by the USGS. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States. The fact sheet discusses 32 significant floods that occurred during the 20th century. The floods were determined to be significant based on a combination of factors including lives lost, and total damage and are broken down into six types of floods: large regional flooding, flash floods, storm surge floods, ice-jam floods, dam and levee failure and mudflow floods.   The USGS routinely makes many direct measurements during floods and after floods subside, said USGS research hydrologist and fact sheet author Charles Perry. We based this new fact sheet on more than 110 years of data that the USGS has collected.  The centurys deadliest flood occurred in Galveston, Texas, during a September 1900 Hurricane. As the superstorm rolled ashore along the Gulf Coast, more than 6,000 persons lost their lives in the monster hurricanes storm surge and wind. Ninety percent of the people killed in hurricanes drown as flood waters rise quickly from the storm surge and heavy rains.  Flash floods from intense thunderstorms are also deadly. In June 1972, 237 persons lost their lives along Rapid Creek during the Rapid City S.D. flood. Four years later in July 1976, 144 persons were killed by flash floods on the Big Thompson and Cache la Poudre Rivers in Colorado.  Nationwide, half of all flash flood deaths are related to automobiles. The fact sheet diagrams the usually fatal consequence of driving through floodwaters. Water only one foot deep flowing over a road can exert more than 500 pounds of lateral force, which sweeps an automobile into the much deeper water along the roadside, Perry said.  Floods are also the most costly of all natural disasters in the United States. In the spring and summer of 1993, long periods of excessive rainfall in the upper Mississippi River Basin flooded nine states, killed 48 people and resulted in record losses of more than $20 billion -- about half of these damages were to residences, businesses, public facilities, and transportation facilities. More than 55,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 532 counties received federal disaster aid.  The USGS maintains more than 7,000 gaging stations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to monitor streamflow. Real-time streamflow information for most of these stations can be accessed through the World Wide Web, providing flood warning for those in harms way. These gages can also be connected directly to warning devices in flash-flood prone areas. All streamflow information is provided by the USGS to various federal, state and local cooperating agencies as well as the general public. The information is available at  http://water.usgs.gov .  Copies of Fact Sheet 02400, Significant Floods in the United States During the 20th CenturyUSGS Measures a Century of Floods, by Charles A. Perry, are available from the USGS, Information Services, Box 25286, Federal Center, Denver, CO 802250286, or call 1 888ASKUSGS. The fact sheet may be viewed on the Web at:  http://ks.water.usgs.gov/Kansas/pubs/fact-sheets/  National real-time streamflow information from the USGS can be accessed through the Internet at:  http://water.usgs.gov/public/dwc/national_map.html  As the nations largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial, scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic and physical development of the nations natural resources, and to enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral resources.  ***USGS***     In-depth information about USGS programs may be found on the USGS home page at  http://www.usgs.gov .

Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.
