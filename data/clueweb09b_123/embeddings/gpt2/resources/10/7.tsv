Whether it's a 200 year old penny or an ancient Roman coin, collectors of old coins enjoy a fascinating hobby. With their depictions of world leaders, epic battles and political mascots, coins offer a personal glimpse into the events of a country's history. The very idea of a coin being passed from generation to generation infuses old coins with a sense of history and heritage that can be quite powerful.    Part of the charm of these antiquities, and much of their value according to some collectors, is the years of accumulated grunge on their surfaces. While some collectors prefer to trade them in their less-than-pristine condition, others opt for a cleaned and polished coin for their collection. Many experts caution against cleaning coins, saying that exposing the metal to the corrosive agents in the air will cause them to lose value. They suggest a gentle cleaning with mild soap and water to remove excess ground dirt, but skip the polishing. Of course, it's up to you to decide if you like the old worn grime, or opt for shiny bits in your collection. If you plan to clean your old coins, make sure you have the proper equipment to do so safely. Coins, especially older ones, are       susceptible to damage from scratchy cleaners and chemicals. Protect your investment by using a cleaning product especially designed for old       coins. You can find verdigris removers, concentrated liquid soap, special brushes and other cleaning products. Some collectors use a       super-concentrated strength of hydrogen peroxide; use care with this, as too much of a good thing can be bad news for older coins.    When dealing with any coins, especially old ones, it's important to understand a coins value. There are a number of resources out there to help you identify and value your old coins. Try one of these books to start:    * The Early Coins of America by Sylvester S. Crosby, 1990    * Standard Catalog of World Coins, a series of books that covers various time frames    * History of the United States Mint by George Evans, 1888 There are also a number of websites out there dedicated to helping collectors identify their coins. And of course your local hobby shop or coin dealer is a great resource for you. You can also visit coin conventions and trade shows to talk to industry insiders. There you can often find collectors who will offer to value your coins on the spot. But get a second opinion before you sell, to be sure you are getting a good deal. A coins value is determined largely by considering its rarity, its demand, its historical importance, and its general condition. To keep your coin from losing value once you acquire it, be sure to protect it when handling and storing. Treat each coin with care, and consider using inexpensive cotton coin gloves whenever you handle the coin. You can find these at any good coin shop, for around $4 a pair. Handle your coins by their edges only, to avoid wear and keep the oil from your hands from collecting on the coins surfaces.    Proper storage is essential to protecting an old coins value. If you store your coins in paper envelopes or albums, be sure that the paper is acid free and designed specifically to be safe for antiques. Plastic slips should also be avoided for older coins, as they can cause corrosion over time. There are clear acid-free envelopes available for storage, that still allow you to see your coins while offering them a safe place to stay. Expect to pay $15-20 for 100 acid-free envelopes. You can find these items at online coin suppliers, your local hobby shop, or at conventions and trade shows.

A collector could simply be a person that collects them in a jar around the house. If you look at those  coins , though, you will likely find a wide array of dates. By doing this, you might become interested in becoming a traditional  coin  collector other types of  coins .    Becoming a collector isn't going to make you rich. You'll probably never land on a stash of  old  Roman or Celtic  coins  that will bring you fame and fortune. If you want to get into  coin   collecting , do it for the pleasure of hunting down increasingly rare or unique ones.    Some people focus on  collecting   coins  created in a limited edition that are new in the marketplace. Others focus on specific types of  coins , such as  old  Canadian or silver  coin  ones.    A collector needs a few tools of the trade. A magnifying glass to examine details on each of them is one. Envelopes or albums to  store  and display the ones you have are other supplies to purchase. A  coin   collecting  price guide that has information on dates, varieties, and grading guidelines is a smart addition.    A plastic ruler that has both millimeters and inches for measuring them, cotton or latex gloves for handling, a soft cloth to set them on for viewing, and good lighting round out the list of supplies.    Starting your hobby of being a  coin  collector involves hunting down new ones. There are plenty of places to find them for your  collecting . Root in your own wallet (and everyone else's who will let you examine them for less-common ones).    Look at the ones on display at flea markets and auctions. The internet is a great resource for buying, selling, and trading  coins . Always keep your  coin   collecting  price guide handy when shopping to avoid scams or paying too much.    If you are not a professional dealer, do not clean your collection. Using the wrong method to clean them can damage some of the  old  rare  coins  and reduce the value of your collection.    Dirty  coins  are perfectly acceptable when you are a collector. If, however, you want to clean those that have no particular value, you can simply use warm water and dishwashing liquid to give them a shine.    Read as much as you can on your new hobby. A good  coin  collector learns what makes it valuable and be able to recognize those  old  Roman  coins  for more than the symbol stamped on them.    As you grow proficient, you'll be able to let go of most common ones and focus on  old  rare ones instead. If you have children or grandchildren, pass those ones down to them. Who knows; you may just have created a new  coin  collector!     Mike Selvon has a passion for  coin   collecting , and his portal has the best information on  coin  collector .

For collecting, see  coin collecting .

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).           Contents       1   History of money   2   History of numismatics     2.1   Modern numismatics   2.2   Subfields       3   Numismatists   4   See also   5   Notes               [ edit ]   History of money   Main article:  History of money   Money itself must be a  scarce  good. Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields   Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily   Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.

While  numismatists  are often characterized as students or collectors of  coins , the discipline also includes a much larger study of  payment media used to resolve  debts  and the exchange of  goods . Lacking a structured  monetary system , people in the past as well as some today lived in a  barter  society and used locally-found items of inherent or implied value. Early money used by people is referred to as ""Odd and Curious"", but the use of other goods in barter exchange is excluded, even where used as a circulating  currency  (e.g.,  cigarettes  in prison). The  Kyrgyz  people used  horses  as the principal currency unit and gave small change in lambskins. [ 1 ]  The  lambskins  may be suitable for numismatic study, but the horse is not. Many objects have been used for centuries, such as  conch shells ,  precious metals  and  gems .   Today, most transactions take place by a form of payment with either inherent, standardized or  credit  value. Numismatic value may be used to refer to the value in excess of the monetary value conferred by law. This is also known as the ""collector's value"" or ""intrinsic value.""   Economic  and  historical  studies of money's use and development are separate to the numismatists' study of money's physical embodiment (although the fields are related; economic theories of money's origin depend upon numismatics, for example).

Many items have been used as money, from naturally scarce  precious metals  and  conch shells  through  cigarettes  to entirely artificial money such as  banknotes . Modern money (and most ancient money too) is essentially a token - an abstraction. Paper currency is perhaps the most common type of physical money today. However, goods such as  gold  or  silver  retain many of the essential properties of money.     [ edit ]   History of numismatics       A  Roman   denarius , a standardized  silver coin .       Coin Collecting may have existed in ancient times. Caesar  Augustus  gave ""coins of every device, including old pieces of the kings and foreign money"" as  Saturnalia  gifts. [ 2 ]   Petrarch , who wrote in a letter that he was often approached by vinediggers with old coins asking him to buy or to identify the ruler, is credited as the first  Renaissance  collector. Petrarch presented a collection of Roman coins to  Emperor Charles IV  in 1355.   The first book on coins was  De Asse et Partibus  (1514) by  Guillaume Bud . [ 3 ] . During the early Renaissance ancient coins were collected by European royalty and nobility. Collectors of coins were Pope  Boniface VIII , Emperor Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire,  Louis XIV  of France, Ferdinand I, Elector  Joachim II  of Brandenburg who started the Berlin coin cabinet and  Henry IV of France  to name a few. Numismatics is called the ""Hobby of Kings"", due to its most esteemed founders.   Professional societies organized in the 19th century. The  Royal Numismatic Society  was founded in 1836 and immediately begin publishing the journal that became the  Numismatic Chronicle . The  American Numismatic Society  was founded in 1858 and began publishing the  American Journal of Numismatics  in 1866.   In 1931 the  British Academy  launched the  Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum  publishing collections of  Ancient Greek coinage . The first volume of  Sylloge of Coins of the British Isles  was published in 1958.   In the 20th century as well the coins were seen more as archaeological objects. After  World War II  in Germany a project,  Fundmnzen der Antike  (Coin finds of the Classical Period) was launched, to register every coin found within Germany. This idea found successors in many countries.   In the United States, the US mint established a coin Cabinet in 1838 when chief coiner Adam Eckfeldt donated his personal collection. [ 4 ]  William E. Du Bois  Pledges of History...  (1846) describes the cabinet.   C. Wyllys Betts'  American colonial history illustrated by contemporary medals  (1894) set the groundwork for the study of American historical medals.     [ edit ]   Modern numismatics   Modern numismatics is the study of the coins of the mid 17th to the 21st century, the period of machine struck coins. Their study serves more the need of collectors than historians and it is more often successfully pursued by amateur aficionados than by professional scholars. The focus of modern numismatics lies frequently in the research of production and use of money in historical contexts using mint or other records in order to determine the relative rarity of the coins they study. Varieties,  mint-made errors , the results of progressive die wear, mintage figures and even the socio-political context of coin mintings are also matters of interest.     [ edit ]   Subfields       Main articles:  Exonumia ,  Notaphily , and  Scripophily       Exonumia  is the study of  coin -like objects such as  token coins  and  medals , and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration. This includes  elongated coins , encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, badges, counterstamped coins,  wooden nickels ,  credit cards , and other similar items. It is related to numismatics proper (concerned with coins which have been  legal tender ), and many  coin collectors  are also exonumists.   Notaphily  is the study of  paper money  or banknotes. It is believed that people have been collecting  paper money  for as long as it has been in use. However, people only started collecting paper money systematically in Germany in the 1920s, particularly the  Serienscheine  (Series notes)  Notgeld . The turning point occurred in the 1970s, when notaphily was established as a separate area by collectors. At the same time, some developed countries such as the  USA ,  Germany  and  France  began publishing their respective national catalogues of paper money, which represented major points of reference literature.   Scripophily  is the study and collection of  stocks  and  Bonds . It is an interesting area of collecting due to both the inherent beauty of some historical documents as well as the interesting historical context of each document. Some stock certificates are excellent examples of  engraving . Occasionally, an old stock document will be found that still has value as a stock in a successor company.     [ edit ]   Numismatists   The term  numismatist  applies to collectors and coin dealers as well scholars using coins as source or studying coins.   The first group chiefly derive pleasure from the simple ownership of monetary devices and studying these coins as private amateur scholars. In the classical field amateur collector studies have achieved quite remarkable progress in the field. Examples are  Walter Breen , a well-known example of a noted numismatist who was not an avid collector, and King  Farouk I of Egypt  was an avid collector who had very little interest in numismatics. Harry Bass by comparison was a noted collector who was also a numismatist.   The second group are the coin dealers. These often called professional numismatists authenticate or  grade  coins for commercial purposes. The buying and selling of coin collections by numismatists who are professional dealers advances the study of money, and expert numismatists are consulted by historians, museum curators, and archaeologists.   The third category are scholar numismatists working in public collections, universities or as independent scholars acquiring knowledge about monetary devices, their systems, their economy and their historical context. Coins are especially relevant as source in the pre-modern period.     [ edit ]   See also         Look up  numismatics  in   Wiktionary , the free dictionary.
