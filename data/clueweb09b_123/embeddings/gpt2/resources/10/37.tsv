This receptor has been suggested to be important for the metabolism of apoprotein-E-containing triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, such as  very-low-density-lipoprotein  (VLDL), beta-migrating VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein. It is also one of the receptors of  reelin , an extracellular matrix protein which regulates the processes of neuronal migration and  synaptic plasticity .           Contents       1   Distribution in the organism   2   Role in pathology   3   References   4   Sources               [ edit ]   Distribution in the organism   In rabbits, the mRNA for the VLDLR was found to be most abundant in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, but was not detectable in the liver. Human mRNA studies showed a very similar pattern of distribution. Hence, it has been suggested that the VLDLR might play an important role in the fatty acid metabolism of non-hepatic tissues.     [ edit ]   Role in pathology   A rare neurological disorder first described in the 1970s under the name ""Disequilibrium syndrome"" is now considered to be caused by the disruption of VLDLR gene. [ 1 ]  The disorder was renamed  VLDLR-associated cerebellar hypoplasia  (VLDLRCH) after a 2005 study. [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  It is associated with parental consanguinity and found in secluded communities such as the  Hutterites . VLDLRCH is one of the two known genetic disorders caused by a disruption of  reelin  signaling pathway, along with  Norman-Roberts syndrome .

A  joint  is the location at which two or more  bones  make contact. [ 1 ]  They are constructed to allow movement and provide mechanical support, and are classified structurally and functionally. [ 2 ]           Contents       1   Classification     1.1   Structural classification   1.2   Functional classification   1.3   Biomechanical classification   1.4   Anatomical       2   Arthritis   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Classification          Depiction of an intervertebral disk, a cartilaginous joint.              Diagram of a synovial (diarthrosis) joint.       Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.   Terms ending in the  suffix  -sis are singular and refer to just one joint, while -ses is the suffix for pluralization.     [ edit ]   Structural classification   Structural classification names and divides joints according to how the bones are connected to each other. [ 3 ]  There are three structural classifications of joints:     fibrous joint  - joined by  fibrous connective tissue   cartilaginous joint  - joined by  cartilage   synovial joint  - not directly joined       [ edit ]   Functional classification   Joints can also be classified functionally, by the degree of mobility they allow: [ 4 ]     synarthrosis  - permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are  fibrous joints  (eg The Skull).   amphiarthrosis  - permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are  cartilaginous joints  (eg. Vertebrae).   diarthrosis  - permits a variety of movements. All diarthrosis joints are  synovial joints  (eg. Shoulder, Hip, Elbow, Knee etc), and the terms ""diarthrosis"" and ""synovial joint"" are considered equivalent by  Terminologia Anatomica . [ 5 ]       [ edit ]   Biomechanical classification   Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into  simple  and  compound , depending on the number of bones involved, and into  complex  and  combination  joints: [ 6 ]     Simple Joint: 2 articulation surfaces (eg.  shoulder joint ,  hip joint )   Compound Joint: 3 or more articulation surfaces (eg.  radiocarpal joint )   Complex Joint: 2 or more articulation surfaces and an  articular disc  or  meniscus  (eg.  knee joint )       [ edit ]   Anatomical   The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:     Articulations of hand   Elbow joints   Wrist joints   Axillary articulations   Sternoclavicular joints   Vertebral articulations   Temporomandibular joints   Sacroiliac joints   Hip joints   Knee joints   Articulations of foot       [ edit ]   Arthritis       Main article:  Arthritis       Arthritis and direct  physical trauma  to a joint are the causes of joint damage. Arthritis is a group of conditions where there is damage caused to the  joints  of the body. Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55.   There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis,  osteoarthritis  (also known as degenerative joint disease) occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are  rheumatoid arthritis  and  psoriatic arthritis , which are  autoimmune diseases  in which the body is attacking itself.  Septic arthritis  is caused by joint  infection .  Gouty arthritis  is caused by deposition of  uric acid  crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as  pseudogout .

It arises from a qualitative or quantitative deficiency of  von Willebrand factor  (vWF), a  multimeric  protein that is required for  platelet  adhesion. It is known to affect humans and dogs. There are four types of  hereditary  vWD. Other factors including ABO blood groups may also play a part in the severity of the condition.

Women may experience  heavy menstrual periods  and blood loss during  childbirth .   Severe  internal  or  joint bleeding  is rare (which only occurs in type 3 vWD).     [ edit ]   Diagnosis   When suspected,  blood plasma  of a patient needs to be investigated for quantitative and qualitative deficiencies of vWF. This is achieved by measuring the amount of vWF in a vWF antigen assay and the functionality of vWF with a  glycoprotein  (GP)Ib binding assay, a  collagen  binding assay or, a  ristocetin  cofactor  activity (RiCof) or  ristocetin induced platelet agglutination  (RIPA) assays.  Factor VIII  levels are also performed because factor VIII is bound to vWF which protects the factor VIII from rapid breakdown within the blood. Deficiency of vWF can therefore lead to a reduction in factor VIII levels. Normal levels do not exclude all forms of vWD: particularly type 2 which may only be revealed by investigating platelet interaction with subendothelium under flow (PAF), a highly specialized coagulation study not routinely performed in most  medical laboratories . A platelet aggregation assay will show an abnormal response to ristocetin with normal responses to the other agonists used. A  platelet function assay  (PFA) will give an abnormal collagen/ adrenaline  closure time and in most cases (but not all) a normal collagen/ ADP  time. Type 2N can only be diagnosed by performing a ""factor VIII binding"" assay. Detection of vWD is complicated by vWF being an  acute phase reactant  with levels rising in  infection ,  pregnancy  and  stress .   Other tests performed in any patient with bleeding problems are a  complete blood count  (especially  platelet  counts),  APTT  (activated partial thromboplastin time),  prothrombin time ,  thrombin  time and  fibrinogen  level. Testing for  factor IX  may also be performed if  hemophilia B  is suspected. Other  coagulation factor  assays may be performed depending on the results of a coagulation screen. Patients with Von Willebrand disease will typically display a normal prothrombin time and a variable prolongation of partial thromboplastin time.     [ edit ]   Classification and types     [ edit ]   Classification   There are four hereditary types of vWD described - type 1, type 2, type 3, and platelet-type. There are inherited and acquired forms of vWD. Most cases are hereditary, but  acquired  forms of vWD have been described. The  International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 's (ISTH) classification depends on the definition of qualitative and quantitative defects. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Type 1   Type 1 vWD (60-80% of all vWD cases) is a quantitative defect (heterozygous for the defective gene) but may not have clearly impaired  clotting , most patients usually end up leading a nearly normal life. Trouble may arise in the form of bleeding following surgery (including dental procedures), noticeable easy bruising, or  menorrhagia  (heavy  periods ). Decreased levels of vWF are detected (10-45% of normal, i.e. 10-45 IU).     [ edit ]   Type 2   Type 2 vWD (20-30%) is a qualitative defect and the bleeding tendency can vary between individuals. There are normal levels of vWF, but the multimers are structurally abnormal, or subgroups of large or small multimers are absent. Four subtypes exist: 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N.     [ edit ]   Type 2A   This is an abnormality of the synthesis or proteolysis of the vWF multimers resulting in the presence of small multimer units in circulation. Factor VIII binding is normal. It has a disproportionately low ristocetin co-factor activity compared to the von Willebrand's antigen.     [ edit ]   Type 2B   This is a ""gain of function"" defect leading to spontaneous binding to platelets and subsequent rapid clearance of the platelets and the large vWF multimers. A mild  thrombocytopenia  may occur. The large vWF multimers are absent in the circulation and the factor VIII binding is normal. Like type 2A, the RiCof:vWF antigen assay is low when the patient's platelet-poor plasma is assayed against formalin-fixed, normal donor platelets. However, when the assay is performed with the patient's own platelets (""platelet-rich plasma""), a lower-than-normal amount of ristocetin causes aggregation to occur. This is due to the large vWF multimers remaining bound to the patient's platelets. Patients with this sub-type are unable to use desmopressin as a treatment for bleeding, because it can lead to unwanted platelet aggregation.     [ edit ]   Type 2M   This is caused by decreased or absent binding to GPIb on the platelets. Factor VIII binding is normal.     [ edit ]   Type 2N (Normandy)   This is a deficiency of the binding of vWF to factor VIII. This type gives a normal vWF antigen level and normal functional test results but has a low factor VIII. This has probably led to some 2N patients being misdiagnosed in the past as having hemophilia A, and should be suspected if the patient has the clinical findings of  hemophilia A  but a pedigree suggesting autosomal, rather than X-linked, inheritance.     [ edit ]   Type 3   Type 3 is the most severe form of vWD (homozygous for the defective gene) and may have severe  mucosal bleeding , no detectable  vWF antigen , and may have sufficiently low  factor VIII  that they have occasional  hemarthroses  (joint bleeding), as in cases of mild  hemophilia .   Platelet-type (also known as pseudo-vWD or platelet-type (pseudo) vWD) Platelet-type vWD is an autosomal dominant type of vWD caused by gain of function mutations of the vWF receptor on platelets; specifically, the alpha chain of the glycoprotein Ib receptor ( GPIb ). This protein is part of the larger complex (GPIb/V/IX) which forms the full vWF receptor on platelets. The ristocetin activity and loss of large vWF multimers is similar to type 2B, but genetic testing of VWF will reveal no mutations.     [ edit ]   Acquired von Willebrand disease   Acquired vWD can occur in patients with  autoantibodies . In this case the function of vWF is not inhibited but the vWF-antibody complex is rapidly cleared from the circulation.   A form of vWD occurs in patients with  aortic valve stenosis , leading to  gastrointestinal bleeding  ( Heyde's syndrome ). This form of acquired vWD may be more prevalent than is presently thought.   Acquired vWF has also been described in the following disorders:  Wilms' tumour ,  hypothyroidism  and  mesenchymal dysplasias .     [ edit ]   Pathophysiology   For the normal function of the coagulation factor, see  von Willebrand factor .   vWF is mainly active in conditions of high blood flow and  shear stress . Deficiency of vWF therefore shows primarily in organs with extensive small vessels, such as the skin, the  gastrointestinal tract  and the  uterus . In  angiodysplasia , a form of  telangiectasia  of the  colon , shear stress is much higher than in average  capillaries , and the risk of bleeding is increased concomitantly.   In more severe cases of type 1 vWD, genetic changes are common within the vWF gene and are highly  penetrant . In milder cases of type 1 vWD there may be a complex spectrum of molecular  pathology  in addition to  polymorphisms  of the vWF gene alone. [ 2 ]  The individual's  ABO blood group  can influence presentation and pathology of vWD. Those individuals with blood group O have a lower mean level than individuals with other blood groups. Unless ABO groupspecific vWF:antigen reference ranges are used, normal group O individuals can be diagnosed as type I vWD, and some individuals of blood group AB with a genetic defect of vWF may have the diagnosis overlooked because vWF levels are elevated due to blood group. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Genetics          von Willebrand disease types I and II are inherited in an  autosomal dominant  pattern.              von Willebrand disease type III (and sometimes II) is inherited in an  autosomal recessive  pattern.       The vWF gene is located on  chromosome twelve  (12p13.2). It has 52 exons spanning 178kbp. Types 1 and 2 are inherited as  autosomal dominant  traits and type 3 is inherited as  autosomal recessive . Occasionally type 2 also inherits recessively.     [ edit ]   Epidemiology   The  prevalence  of vWD is about 1 in 100 individuals. [ 4 ]  However the majority of these people do not have symptoms. The prevalence of clinically significant cases is 100 per million. [ 4 ]  Because most forms are rather mild, they are detected more often in women, whose bleeding tendency shows during  menstruation . It may be more severe or apparent in people with  blood type  O.     [ edit ]   Therapy   Patients with vWD normally require no regular treatment, although they are always at increased risk for bleeding. For women with heavy menstrual bleeding, the  combined oral contraceptive pill  may be effective in reducing bleeding or in reducing the length or frequency of periods. Prophylactic treatment is sometimes given for patients with vWD who are scheduled for surgery. They can be treated with human derived medium purity  factor VIII  concentrates complexed to vWF(antihemophilic factor, more commonly known as  Humate-P ) Mild cases of vWD can be trialled on  desmopressin  (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP) (desmopressin acetate,  Stimate ), which works by raising the patient's own plasma levels of vWF by inducing release of vWF stored in the  Weibel-Palade bodies  in the endothelial cells.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body       Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein       As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation       Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder       The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.

People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer.

People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron.

Human iron metabolism  is the set of chemical reactions maintaining  human homeostasis  of  iron . Iron is an essential element for most life on Earth, including  human beings . The control of this necessary but potentially  toxic  substance is an important part of many aspects of human  health  and  disease .  Hematologists  have been especially interested in the system of iron  metabolism  because iron is essential to  red blood cells . Most of the  human body 's iron is contained in red blood cells'  hemoglobin , and  iron deficiency anemia  is the most common type of  anemia .   Understanding this system is also important for understanding diseases of  iron overload , like  hemochromatosis .   Recent discoveries in the field have shed new light on how humans control the level of iron in their bodies and created new understanding of the mechanisms of several diseases.

Iron is an absolute requirement for most forms of life, including humans and most  bacterial  species. Because  plants  and  animals  all use iron, iron can be found in a wide variety of food sources.   Iron is essential to life, because of its unique ability to serve as both an  electron donor  and  acceptor .   Iron can also be potentially toxic. Its ability to donate and accept electrons means that if iron is free within the cell, it can  catalyze  the conversion of  hydrogen peroxide  into  free radicals . Free radicals can cause damage to a wide variety of cellular structures, and ultimately kill the cell. To prevent that kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to  proteins . That allows the cells to use the benefits of iron, but also limit its ability to do harm.  [1]   The most important group of iron-binding proteins contain the  heme  molecules, all of which contain iron at their centers. Humans and most bacteria use variants of  heme  to carry out  redox  reactions and  electron transport  processes. These reactions and processes are required for  oxidative phosphorylation . That process is the principal source of energy for human cells; without it, our cells would die.   The  iron-sulfur proteins  are another important group of iron-containing proteins. Some of these proteins are also essential parts of oxidative phosphorylation.   Humans also use iron in the  hemoglobin  of  red blood cells , in order to transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and to export carbon dioxide back to the lungs. Iron is also an essential component of  myoglobin  to store and diffuse oxygen in muscle cells.   The human body needs iron for oxygen transport. That oxygen is required for the production and survival of all  cells  in our bodies. Human bodies tightly regulate iron  absorption  and  recycling . Iron is such an essential element of human life, in fact, that humans have no physiologic regulatory mechanism for  excreting  iron. Most humans prevent  iron overload  solely by regulating iron absorption. Those who cannot regulate absorption well enough get disorders of  iron overload . In these diseases, the toxicity of iron starts overwhelming the body's ability to bind and store it.  [2]     [ edit ]   Bacterial protection   A proper iron metabolism protects against  bacterial infection . If bacteria are to survive, then they must get iron from the environment. Disease-causing bacteria do this in many ways, including releasing iron-binding molecules called  siderophores  and then reabsorbing them to recover iron, or scavenging iron from hemoglobin and transferrin. The harder they have to work to get iron, the greater a  metabolic price  they must pay. That means that iron-deprived bacteria reproduce more slowly. So our control of iron levels appears to be an important defense against bacterial infection. People with increased amounts of iron, like people with  hemochromatosis , are more susceptible to bacterial infection.  [3]   Although this mechanism is an elegant response to short-term bacterial infection, it can cause problems when inflammation goes on for longer. Since the liver produces  hepcidin  in response to inflammatory  cytokines , hepcidin levels can increase as the result of non-bacterial sources of inflammation, like viral infection, cancer, auto-immune diseases or other chronic diseases. When this occurs, the sequestration of iron appears to be the major cause of the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease , in which not enough iron is available to produce enough  hemoglobin -containing red blood cells.  [4]     [ edit ]   Body iron stores          1918 illustration of blood cell production in the  bone marrow . In iron deficiency, the bone marrow produces fewer blood cells, and as the deficiency gets worse, the cells become smaller.       Most well-nourished people in industrialized countries have 3-4 grams of iron in their bodies. Of this, about 2.5 g is contained in the hemoglobin needed to carry oxygen through the blood. Another 400 mg is devoted to cellular proteins that use iron for important cellular processes like storing oxygen ( myoglobin ), or performing energy-producing  redox  reactions ( cytochromes ). 3-4 mg circulates through the  plasma , bound to  transferrin .  [5]   Since so much iron is required for hemoglobin,  iron deficiency anemia  is the first and primary clinical manifestation of  iron deficiency . Oxygen transport is so important to human life that severe anemia harms or kills people by depriving their organs of enough oxygen. Iron-deficient people will suffer or die from organ damage well before cells run out of the iron needed for intracellular processes like electron transport.   Some iron in the body is stored. Physiologically, most stored iron is bound by  ferritin  molecules; the largest amount of ferritin-bound iron is found in cells of the liver  hepatocytes , the  bone marrow  and the  spleen . The liver's stores of ferritin are the primary physiologic source of reserve iron in the body.   Macrophages  of the  reticuloendothelial system  store iron as part of the process of breaking down and processing hemoglobin from engulfed  red blood cells .   Iron is also stored as a pigment called  hemosiderin  in an apparently pathologic process. This molecule appears to be mainly the result of cell damage. It is often found engulfed by  macrophages  that are scavenging regions of damage. It can also be found among people with iron overload due to frequent blood cell destruction and transfusions.   Men tend to have more stored iron than women, particularly women who must use their stores to compensate for iron lost through  menstruation ,  pregnancy  or  lactation .     [ edit ]   How the body gets its iron   Most of the iron in the body is hoarded and recycled by the  reticuloendothelial system  which breaks down aged  red blood cells . However, people lose a small but steady amount by  sweating  and by shedding cells of the  skin  and the  mucosal  lining of the  gastrointestinal tract . The total amount of loss for healthy people in the developed world amounts to an estimated average of 1 mg a day for men, and 1.52 mg a day for women with regular menstrual periods. People in developing countries with gastrointestinal parasitic infections often lose more.  [6]   This steady loss means that people must continue to absorb iron. They do so via a tightly regulated process that under normal circumstances protects against iron overload.     [ edit ]   Absorbing iron from the diet          Meat contains heme, which is a source of iron.       Like most mineral nutrients, iron from digested food or supplements is almost entirely absorbed in the  duodenum  by  enterocytes  of the duodenal lining. These cells have special molecules that allow them to move iron into the body.   To be absorbed, dietary iron must be in its ferrous Fe 2+  form. A ferric reductase enzyme on the enterocytes'  brush border ,  Dcytb , reduces ferric Fe 3+  to Fe 2+ . A protein called divalent metal transporter 1  DMT1 , which transports all kinds of  divalent  metals into the body, then transports the iron across the enterocyte's  cell membrane  and into the cell.   These intestinal lining cells can then either store the iron as ferritin (in which case the iron will leave the body when the cell dies and is sloughed off into  feces ) or the cell can move it into the body, using a protein called  ferroportin . The body regulates iron levels by regulating each of these steps. For instance, cells produce more Dcytb, DMT1 and ferroportin in response to  iron deficiency anemia .  [7]   Our bodies' rates of iron absorption appear to respond to a variety of interdependent factors, including total iron stores, the extent to which the  bone marrow  is producing new red blood cells, the concentration of hemoglobin in the blood, and the oxygen content of the blood. We also absorb less iron during times of  inflammation . Recent discoveries demonstrate that  hepcidin  regulation of ferroportin (see below) is responsible for the syndrome of  anemia of chronic disease .   While Dcytb and DMT1 are unique to iron transport across the duodenum,  ferroportin  is distributed throughout the body on all cells which store iron. Thus, regulation of  ferroportin  is the body's main way of regulating the amount of iron in circulation.   Hephaestin , a  ferroxidase  that which can oxidize Fe 2+  to Fe 3+  and is found mainly in the small intestine, helps  ferroportin  transfer iron across the basolateral end of the intestine cells.     [ edit ]   Reasons for iron deficiency          Iron is an important topic in  prenatal care  because women can sometimes become iron-deficient from the increased iron demands of pregnancy.       Functional or actual  iron deficiency  can result from a variety of causes, explained in more detail in the article dedicated to this topic. These causes can be grouped into several categories:     Increased demand for iron, which the diet cannot accommodate.   Increased loss of iron (usually through loss of blood).   Nutritional deficiency. This can either be the result of failure to eat iron-containing foods, or eating a diet heavy in food that reduces the absorption of iron, or both.   Inability to absorb iron because of damage to the intestinal lining. Examples of causes of this kind of damage include surgery involving the duodenum, or diseases like  Crohn's  or  celiac sprue  which severely reduce the surface area available for absorption.   Inflammation leading to  hepcidin -induced restriction on iron release from enterocytes (see below).       [ edit ]   The possibility of too much iron   The body is able to substantially reduce the amount of iron it absorbs across the mucosa. It does not seem to be able to entirely shut down the iron transport process. Also, in situations where excess iron damages the intestinal lining itself (for instance, when children eat a large quantity of iron tablets produced for adult consumption), even more iron can enter the bloodstream and cause a potentially deadly syndrome of  iron intoxication . Large amounts of free iron in the circulation will cause damage to critical cells in the  liver , the  heart  and other metabolically active organs.   Iron toxicity results when the amount of circulating iron exceeds the amount of  transferrin  available to bind it, but the body is able to vigorously regulate its iron uptake. Thus, iron toxicity from ingestion is usually the result of extraordinary circumstances like iron tablet overdose [8]  rather than variations in  diet . Iron toxicity is usually the result of more chronic  iron overload  syndromes associated with genetic diseases, repeated transfusions or other causes.     [ edit ]   How cells get their iron from the body   Main article:  Iron-responsive element binding protein   As discussed above, most of the iron in the body is located on hemoglobin molecules of red blood cells. When red blood cells reach a certain age, they are degraded and engulfed by specialized scavenging  macrophages . These cells internalize the iron-containing hemoglobin, degrade it, put the iron onto transferrin molecules, and then export the transferrin-iron complexes back out into the blood. Most of the iron used for blood cell production comes from this cycle of hemoglobin recycling.   All cells use some iron, and must get it from the circulating  blood . Since iron is tightly bound to transferrin, cells throughout the body have receptors for transferrin-iron complexes on their surfaces. These receptors  engulf and internalize  both the protein and the iron attached to it. Once inside, the cell transfers the iron to  ferritin , the internal iron storage molecule.   Transferrin receptor production will increase, and ferritin production will decrease.  [9]     [ edit ]   Regulation by location   In summary, regulation of iron levels is a task of the whole body, as well as for individual cells.   When  body  levels of iron are too low, then  hepcidin  in the  duodenal epithelium  is decreased. This causes an increase in  ferroportin  activity, stimulating iron uptake in the  digestive system . Vice versa in iron surplus.   In  individual cells , an iron deficiency causes  responsive element binding protein  to  iron responsive elements  on mRNAs for  transferrin receptors , resulting in increased production of transferrin receptors. These receptors increase binding of  transferrin  to cells, and therefore stimulating iron uptake.          Electron micrograph of  E. coli . All bacteria that cause human disease require iron to live and to multiply.         [ edit ]   Diseases of iron regulation   Main article:  Iron metabolism disorder   The exact mechanisms of most of the various forms of adult hemochromatosis, which make up most of the genetic  iron overload  disorders, remain unsolved. So while researchers have been able to identify genetic mutations causing several adult variants of hemochromatosis, they now must turn their attention to the normal function of these mutated genes.

VLDL is one of the five major groups of lipoproteins ( chylomicrons ,  VLDL ,  IDL ,  LDL ,  HDL ) which enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water based solution of the blood stream. It is assembled in the  liver  from  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins . It is converted in the bloodstream to  low-density lipoprotein  (LDL). VLDL particles have a diameter of 30-80  nm . VLDL transports endogenous products where  chylomicrons  transport exogenous (dietary) products.

It functions as the body's internal transport mechanism for lipids.     [ edit ]   Changes during circulation   Nascent VLDL circulates in blood and picks up  apolipoprotein C-II  and  apolipoprotein E  donated from  High-Density Lipoprotein  (HDL). At this point, the nascent VLDL becomes a mature VLDL. Once in circulation, the VLDL will come in contact with  lipoprotein lipase  (LPL) in the capillary beds in the body (adipose, cardiac, and skeletal muscle). The LPL will remove triglycerides from the VLDL for storage or energy production.   The VLDL now meets back up with HDL where apoC-II is transferred back to the HDL (but keeps apoE). In addition to this, the HDL transfers cholesteryl esters to the VLDL in exchange for phospholipids and triglycerides (via  cholesteryl ester transfer protein ).   As more and more triglycerides are removed from the VLDL because of the action of the LPL enzyme, the composition of the molecule changes, and it becomes intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL).   50% of IDL are recognized by receptors in the liver cells (because of the  apoB-100  and apoE they contain) and are  endocytosed .   The other 50% of IDL lose their apoE. When their cholesterol content becomes greater than the triglyceride content, they become low-density lipoprotein (LDL), with the primary apolipoprotein being apoB-100. The LDL is taken into a cell via the LDL receptor (endocytosis) where the contents are either stored, used for cell membrane structure, or converted into other products (steroid hormones or bile acids).     [ edit ]   VLDL and disease   VLDL levels have been correlated with accelerated rates of  atherosclerosis , and are elevated in a number of diseases and metabolic states.   The uniqueness of this correlation is disputed by Harchaoui and Boekholdt  http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/551425     [ edit ]   See also     Combined hyperlipidemia                   v    d    e     Lipids :  lipoprotein  metabolism             General     Chylomicron  -  HDL  -  LDL  -  IDL  -  VLDL  -  Lp(a)               Apolipoproteins     APOA ( 1 ,  2 ,  5 ) -  APOB  - APOC ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 ) -  APOD  -  APOE  -  APOH               Other     Lipoprotein lipase  - HDL ( Cholesterylester transfer protein ,  Acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase ,  LCAT ) -  LDL receptor  -  Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein  -  ABCA1                 see also  disorders                                       Retrieved from "" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_low-density_lipoprotein ""      Categories :  Lipoproteins                                   Views                   Article        Discussion        Edit this page        History                   Personal tools                Log in / create account                                 Navigation                Main page       Contents       Featured content       Current events       Random article                    Search                                                Interaction                About Wikipedia       Community portal       Recent changes       Contact Wikipedia       Donate to Wikipedia       Help                    Toolbox                What links here       Related changes   Upload file   Special pages       Printable version      Permanent link Cite this page                   Languages                Deutsch       Suomi       Franais              Nederlands              Trke                                                    This page was last modified on 24 November 2008, at 00:00.
