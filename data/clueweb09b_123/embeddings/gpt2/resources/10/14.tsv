Designer Bonnie Clewans has a pretty Glitter Cubed bracelet project up over at  Beading Daily . It combines two-needle ladder and picot stitch and is finished off with a button clasp.

Wednesday December 31, 2008   As we look ahead to 2009, I know many jewelry designers are thinking of expanding on their jewelry techniques, and one way to do this is to explore and experiment with materials they may have not used before or have had very little experience using. I know for me, I am hoping to work more with metal and fiber, maybe even finding ways to incorporate them together into designs. I'm also interested in working more with resin. What about you? Take the poll, and feel free to leave a comment or two, especially if there's a medium I did not include for consideration in the poll.         Comments  (5) Permalink   New Year's Resolutions for Jewelry Designers   Tuesday December 30, 2008   2009 is almost here, so it's time for some self-reflection. I know that not everyone is into making New Year's Resolutions, but even if you don't want to call them that, maybe goals or future objectives might be a good way to think about how you'd like to tackle your jewelry making in 2009. I think it is always a good thing to take some time to think about what you have been doing when it comes to your hobby, life, work, etc. and how you can improve your approach.    I've put together a poll below using some of my own ideas and also those collected from a similar  post over at the forum . Thank you to all the forum members who contributed to helping me create the poll. I think many of us have a lot of the same objectives for 2009, but if not, feel free to include yours in the comments.

Comments  (0) Permalink   Favorite Jewelry Projects for 2008   Friday December 26, 2008   Before I head into 2009, I thought it might be nice to look back briefly at 2008 and some of my favorite jewelry projects. These are the top 10 picks from my jewelry box:    Fine Silver Link, Pearl, and Crystal Earrings : I wear these a lot because they pretty much go with everything, and I like the idea that it combines so many different media: metal clay, pearls, crystals, wire, and chain.    Queen of Hearts Metal Clay and Crystal Earrings : This is another metal clay favorite of mine. I wear black pants a lot (for obvious reasons), and these have just a touch of black. I have gotten a lot of compliments on them.    Crystal Amethyst Heart Bracelet : I made this bracelet very early in the year, and it's still a winner in my jewelry box!    Raku Bead and Hemp Necklace Tutorial : Another piece I get compliments on is this hemp and lampwork Raku bead necklace. Since making this one, I've made a few similar ones to give as gifts.    Purple Pearl & Opal Cube Earrings : Of course, I needed some earrings to go with the above necklace, and these fairly long earrings are great with it or teamed with just some simple sterling jewelry.    Puzzle Piece Brass & Crystal Earrings : I like experimenting with unusual jewelry components, so these puzzle piece earrings were fun to make, and I like wearing them too. They definitely get noticed.    Silver and Crystal Autism Adjustable Puzzle Necklace : I made this necklace as well as  a matching pair of earrings  as a special request for someone, and I have yet to make this for myself, but I have the same charms set aside for moi as well as a gold-tone set as well.     Glass Frame Poetry Pendant : Emily Dickinson is my favorite poet, so this mixed-media pendant project was an instant favorite of mine as well.    Blue Resin and Crystal Hoop Earrings : Along with these earrings which I used prefabricated resin components for, I have also done some experimenting making my own resin items, and I hope to do more of this in the coming year.     Amazing Butterfly Crystal Dangle Hoop Earrings : Finally, this is one of my latest projects so it is one of my favorites. These are easy to make and light-weight, so they are very wearable as far as comfort. They are also neutral enough to go with anything, but the aurora borealis finish on the butterfly beads make them really sparkle.
