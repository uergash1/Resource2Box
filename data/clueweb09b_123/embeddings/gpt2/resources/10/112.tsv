(Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

Package                      on Septic Systems                     Did                      you know about 25 percent of the U.S. population relies on                      decentralized—or onsite—wastewater treatment systems?                      About 95 percent of the onsite wastewater disposal systems                      are septic systems.                         What                      is a septic system?                       A                      septic system is a highly efficient, self-contained, underground                      wastewater treatment system. Because septic systems treat                      and dispose of household wastewater onsite, they are often                      more economical than centralized sewer systems in rural areas                      where lot sizes are larger and houses are spaced widely apart.                      Septic systems are also simple in design, which make them                      generally less expensive to install and maintain. And by using                      natural processes to treat the wastewater onsite, usually                      in a homeowner's backyard, septic systems don't require the                      installation of miles of sewer lines, making them less disruptive                      to the environment.                      A                      septic system consists of two main parts-a septic tank and                      a drainfield. The septic tank is a watertight box, usually                      made of concrete or fiberglass, with an inlet and outlet pipe.                      Wastewater flows from the home to the septic tank through                      the sewer pipe. The septic tank treats the wastewater naturally                      by holding it in the tank long enough for solids and liquids                      to separate. The wastewater forms three layers inside the                      tank. Solids lighter than water (such as greases and oils)                      float to the top forming a layer of scum. Solids heavier than                      water settle at the bottom of the tank forming a layer of                      sludge. This leaves a middle layer of partially clarified                      wastewater.                      The                      layers of sludge and scum remain in the septic tank where                      bacteria found naturally in the wastewater work to break the                      solids down. The sludge and scum that cannot be broken down                      are retained in the tank until the tank is pumped. The layer                      of clarified liquid flows from the septic tank to the drainfield                      or to a distribution device, which helps to uniformly distribute                      the wastewater in the drainfield. A standard drainfield (also                      known as a leachfield, disposal field, or a soil absorption                      system) is a series of trenches or a bed lined with gravel                      or course sand and buried one to three feet below the ground                      surface. Perforated pipes or drain tiles run through the trenches                      to distribute the wastewater. The drainfield treats the wastewater                      by allowing it to slowly trickle from the pipes out into the                      gravel and down through the soil. The gravel and soil act                      as biological filters.                      Top                       Septic                      System Maintenance                       If                      you own a septic system, it is important that it be properly                      maintained. How often you need to pump the solids out of your                      septic tank depends on three major factors:                                                                    the number of people in your household;                       the                        amount of wastewater generated (based on the number of people                        in the household and the amount of water used); and                        the                        volume of solids in the wastewater (e.g., using a garbage                        disposal will increase the amount of solids).                                          Although                      your septic tank absorption field generally does not require                      maintenance, you should adhere to the following rules to protect                      and prolong its functional life:                                            Do                        not drive over the absorption field with cars, trucks, or                        heavy equipment.                        Do                        not plant trees or shrubbery in the absorption field area,                        because the roots can get into the lines and plug them.                                               Do                        not cover the absorption field with hard surfaces, such                        as concrete or asphalt. Grass is the best cover, because                        it will help prevent erosion and help remove excess water.                                               Do                        divert surface runoff water from roofs, patios, driveways,                        and other areas away from the absorption field.                                          Homeowners                      wanting to take good care of their septic systems should make                      note of the following items that should never be flushed down                      the drain or toilet. These items can overtax or destroy the                      biological digestion taking place within the system or clog                      pumps and pipes.                      Take                      care not to flush the following:                                             hair                        combings                        coffee grounds                         dental floss                         disposable diapers                         kitty litter                         sanitary napkins                         tampons                         cigarette butts                         condoms                         gauze bandages                         fat, grease, or oil                         paper towels                                          and                        NEVER   flush                      chemicals that could contaminate surface and groundwater,                      such as:                                              paints                                                varnishes                         thinners                         waste oils                         photographic solutions                         pesticides                                          Top                       Septic                      System Brochures                     If                      you're looking for information on how to properly maintain                      your septic system, avoid potential system problems, or are                      planning on buying or selling a home with a septic system,                      look no further. The NSFC offers a series of three brochures                      about septic system operation and maintenance. These brochures                      describe how septic systems work and give some general guidelines                      to help protect the groundwater and prolong the life of your                      septic system.

Brown and M.V. Peart 2 Most homes in Florida are connected to a public sewage treatment system. However, over 1.3 million families (about 27% of Florida's housing units) live in rural and sparsely developed suburban areas not served with a public system. Properly sited, designed, constructed, and maintained septic systems can provide an efficient and economical wastewater treatment alternative to public sewer systems. People who have septic systems or who plan to buy property that has or will have a septic system should understand what the system does and how to use and maintain it.  WHAT DOES A SEPTIC SYSTEM DO?   Wastewater from homes is a by-product of most of the water-using processes carried on in the home. An average of 40 to 50 gallons of wastewater is produced per person per day. The purpose of on-site sewage systems is to dispose of these wastes and to treat the water so it will be safe when it reaches drinking water supplies or recreational waters. The septic system consists of more than just the septic tank itself. In fact, the largest part of the treatment of the wastewater actually takes place in the soil beneath the drainfield.  The Septic Tank   Wastewater flows through a pipe into the septic tank. Baffles or ""tees"" at the inlet and outlet of the tank slow the flow of water and prevent sewage from flowing directly through the tank ( Figure 1 ).     Figure 1.    A typical septic system.     Bacterial action within a septic tank helps to break down the solids in the wastewater that enter the tank. The tank must be large enough, and the rate of flow small enough, to ensure sufficient ""residence time"" of wastewater in the tank. Even when the tank is working properly and solids are being broken down at a rate sufficient to prevent their movement into the drainfield, partially digested solids and any materials that cannot be digested sink to the bottom of the tank and accumulate as sludge. Grease, foam, and lighter particles float to the surface and form a layer of scum. The exit baffle arrangement holds back sludge and scum while allowing a partially digested wastewater to flow out of the tank. It is important that sludge and scum not get out of the tank and into the drainfield as they can clog soil pores and cause the septic system to fail. If allowed to build up in the tank, the volume available to accommodate liquid is drastically reduced. Therefore, the tank must be pumped out periodically. Sizes of septic tanks that are required for different sizes of families and establishments are defined in Chapter 1OD-6 of the Florida Administrative Code, which sets the standards for on-site sewage disposal system design and installation in the state. With the exception of parts of extreme south Florida, the standards are uniform across the state. In addition, some counties have established rules that are more restrictive than state code. Information on state and county standards and their implications for individual systems may be obtained from the environmental health office of your county health unit.  The Distribution Box   Partially treated wastewater flows from the septic tank into a distribution box, or in some cases into a ""header pipe"". There, the wastewater is spread evenly into porous pipes arrayed in the absorption field. The distribution box may be attached directly to the septic tank or connected to it by a short length of pipe.  The Soil Absorption Field   The soil absorption field is the land area where the wastewater from the septic tank is spread into the soil. One of the most common types of soil absorption field has porous plastic pipe extending away from the distribution box in a series of two or more parallel trenches, usually 1-1/2 to 2 feet wide. In conventional, below ground systems, the trenches are 1-1/2 to 2 feet deep. The porous pipe is surrounded by gravel that fills the trench to within a foot or so of the ground surface. The gravel is covered by fabric material or building paper to prevent plugging. Some absorption fields must be placed at a shallower depth than this to compensate for some limiting soil condition such as a hardpan or high water table. In some cases they may even be placed partially or entirely in fill material that has been brought to the lot from elsewhere. Another type of drainfield consists of pipes that extend away from the distribution box not in trenches but in a single, gravel-filled bed that has several such porous pipes in it. As with trenches, the gravel in a bed is covered by fabric or other appropriate material. Usually the wastewater flows gradually downward into the gravel-filled trenches or bed. In some instances, however, as where the septic tank is lower than the drainfield, a pump must be installed in order to lift the wastewater up into the drainfield. Whether gravity flow or pumping is used to get wastewater into the drainfield, wastewater must be evenly distributed throughout the drainfield. It is important to ensure that the drainfield is installed with care to keep the porous pipe level, or at a very gradual downward slope away from the distribution box or pump chamber, according to specifications stipulated by local officials. Soil beneath the gravel-filled trenches or bed must be permeable so that wastewater and air can move through it and come in contact with each other. Good aeration is necessary to ensure that the proper chemical and microbiological processes will be occurring in the soil to cleanse the percolating wastewater of contaminants. A well-aerated soil also ensures slow travel and good contact between wastewater and soil.  SOIL CONSIDERATIONS   In former times the permeability of Florida soil was determined by a percolation test, or ""perk"" test. Such a test involved excavating a round hole in the soil at the site, filling the hole with water in a standard fashion, and measuring the subsequent rate of fall of the water level in the hole. However, the perk test has been de-emphasized as a site evaluation technique in Florida. Instead, Florida's septic system siting standards require that a site investigation be conducted. The site investigation includes examination of the soils for a variety of characteristics that will help to predict septic system performance during all seasons of the year. The two most important soil attributes that must be described and understood in such a site investigation are: (1) soil permeability; and (2) wet-season water table.  Soil Permeability   In assessing soil permeability, more than one auger boring must be made and the soil described down at least to the 5-foot depth. Features studied and described include: 1) soil texture (proportions of sand, silt, and clay); 2) potentially restrictive layers, such as claypans or chemically cemented layers; 3) layers of organic matter (muck) or gravel; 4) zones of contrasting soil materials; and 5) variation in these sorts of soil features across the site. If prohibited materials, such as hardpans, clay, muck, or gravel, are found in the 3-1/2 foot zone that will immediately underlie a proposed drainfield, then the unsuitable material must be excavated and replaced with appropriate fill material. Alternatively, depending on the water table and other conditions, the drainfield may be elevated above the unsuitable material by building a mound of permeable soil brought to the site from elsewhere. Or, where site conditions are extremely limiting, the permit may be denied altogether. Assuming that the soil is found to be suitable in the 3-1/2 foot zone under the proposed drainfield, or that suitable fill can be placed there, the suitability of these soil materials still must be known in order to determine the size of the drainfield. This is necessary to ensure that the drainfield will receive wastewater from the septic tank at a rate not exceeding the capacity of the soil to accept it. The permitting officer must: 1) estimate the daily flow of wastewater; 2) determine the size of septic tank needed; 3) estimate the permeability of the soil in the 3-1/2 foot zone under the drainfield; and 4) compute the required drainfield size from the estimated flow rate and the estimated soil permeability at the site. Generally, the more clayey soils will be found to have lower permeabilities and therefore will require larger drainfields. For example, a small home with sandy soils in its yard might be required to have only a 900-gallon tank and a drainfield with only 200 square feet of bottom. On the other hand, a large home (having greater wastewater flow) with more clayey (and therefore less permeable) soils might need a 1,200-gallon tank and a drainfield with 800 square feet of trench bottom.  Wet-Season Water Table Level   The other important soil feature that must be understood before a permit can be issued in Florida is the depth to which the water table rises in wet seasons. Once this is determined, the trench/bed bottom can be set at an elevation at least 2 feet above that wet-season water table level. The water table is the more-or-less horizontal boundary between unsaturated soil above and wet soil below. The depth to the water table varies greatly depending on location and on the nature of the soil and landscape at any given site. Another key factor controlling depth of the water table is the weather. After an extended rainy period, the water table is likely to be much higher in the soil than it would be in the same soil following a long drought. The behavior of the water table is further complicated by the presence or absence of water-using vegetation on a site. Ground that seems rather dry when investigated while natural vegetation is intact may become wetter after the trees are cleared for development. Site investigations need to proceed with the understanding that the depth to the water table is a dynamic feature of the soil. State septic system code requires that the depth to which the water table is likely to rise during wet seasons of most years be determined when site investigations are performed. Septic system design depends heavily on the depth of the wet-season water table. Code stipulates that the bottom of the gravel-filled trench or bed must be at least two feet above that depth. If the wet-season water table is estimated to be 24 inches below the ground surface, for example, then the drainfield must be designed so that its bottom is at or above the natural ground surface. In this case, fill material would have to be brought in to allow the burial of the drainfield with a 2-foot separation.  PERMITTING AND INSTALLING A SEPTIC SYSTEM   Since 1983, Florida's septic system siting standards have required a site investigation to be conducted that includes examination of the soils for a variety of characteristics. Knowing these characteristics will help to predict septic system performance during all seasons. Approval of the site also must take into consideration numerous other factors, including proximity of the site to surface waters and to drinking water supply wells. The system can only be located, sized, and otherwise designed when the characteristics of the site are known. The investigation must be conducted by a qualified person from the county health unit, or from another agency or firm approved by that county health unit. After the system is permitted and installed, but before it is covered with soil, it must receive final approval. Questions should be directed to your local county health unit.  MANAGING A HOME SEPTIC SYSTEM   The home septic system should have been originally designed and installed to meet the normal wastewater disposal needs of a certain size home, given the soil conditions on the site.  Controlling Volume of Wastewater   Sending wastewater to the tank too fast can cause solid materials to pass into the drainfield without undergoing gradual anaerobic digestion. Conservative water use should be practiced in the house to ensure slow movement of wastewater into the tank, reasonably complete digestion of solids, and slow trickling of wastewater from the tank to the drainfield. Try to avoid consecutive, extra-large loads of laundry, marathon showers, and other excessive uses that may send big surges of wastewater into the system. The brine solution and excess water from the backwash of a water softener probably will not harm most septic systems, although they could dictate the need for a slightly larger tank and drainfield. Water-saving devices available for toilets and shower heads are encouraged. Do not connect sump pump outlets or roof gutters to the system. It would be wise to make sure that any runoff from the roof, the driveway, and other impermeable surfaces is directed well away from the drainfield. Doing so will prevent extraordinary buildup of water in the drainfield. Using the system at or below its design capacity will help to ensure against failure that could cause backing up of wastewater into the house and/or environmental contamination of the yard, of nearby surface waters, or of underlying ground water.  Controlling Quality of Wastewater   The quality of wastewater — not just its quantity — is also important in ensuring proper septic system function. Fats and grease should never be poured down the drain. They can solidify in the lines and cause failure; they can cause excessive buildup of the floating scum layer in the septic tank itself; and they can get into the drainfield and surrounding soil and seal the system off altogether. Installation of garbage grinders is not encouraged in homes served by septic systems. If you have one, use it in moderation. Septic systems are intended to be used for the treatment and disposal of human wastes and wash waters that reasonably may be expected to come from the home. Allow household cleansers, disinfectants, and bleaches into the septic system only in moderation. Anything else does not belong in a septic system. Do not put any toxic or hazardous materials, such as paints, thinners, waste oils, photographic solutions, or poisons into a septic system; they will not be treated sufficiently to prevent contamination of water that returns to your local ground and/or surface waters. Other materials that cannot be decomposed in a septic system include coffee grounds, dental floss, disposable diapers, cat box litter, cigarette butts, sanitary napkins, tampons, plastics, facial tissues, and paper towels. Such materials merely increase the risk of plugging and necessitate more frequent cleaning.  Maintaining the Septic Tank   Slow buildups of sludge and scum are normal. Removal of these materials by periodic pumping and appropriate disposal is necessary to protect the absorption field from materials that will damage its effectiveness. Annual or biannual inspection of the septic tank is advisable to determine the thickness of the sludge and scum layers. A probe may be put into the tank from one of its access ports to make this determination. If the homeowner or other resident has any doubts about inspecting the septic tank, a private contractor who specializes in septic system cleaning and pumping should be contacted. Such a service will cost the homeowner some money, but it should be thought of as preventive maintenance. Additives that are marketed as septic tank cleaners, rejuvenators, or primers are not recommended. Strong chemicals can harm a septic system, and Florida's code prohibits the sale of organic chemical solvents for the purpose of degreasing or declogging septic systems.  Maintaining the Drainfield   Activities that help to maintain the septic tank itself will serve similarly to maintain the drainfield. If the tank is free of excessive sludge and if it is used well within its designed capacity, and if the quality of wastewater sent to it is proper, then the drainfield is likely to last for a long time without a major dig-out and repair. All this assumes that the wet-season water table is at least 2 feet below the bottom of the drainfield, and that the soil is adequately permeable. Additional measures that the homeowner can take include such things as: 1) do not allow vehicular traffic over the drainfield, which can compact the soil and possibly break drain lines; 2) try to position trees so that their roots will not enter the drainlines and plug them; and 3) keep a healthy grass cover over the system to prevent exposure of the soil and possible erosion around the drain lines.  REPAIRS TO YOUR SEPTIC SYSTEM   You may not know you have experienced a septic system failure until the first obvious signs show up in the yard, in the form of wet, smelly spots. Or, worse, the failure may cause the toilets and other drains to back up. Depending on the nature of the failure, repairs to a septic system can range widely in complexity and cost. One failure might turn out to require only a simple clearing of the household sewer lines to remove a stoppage. Another problem might be solved by having the septic tank pumped out. In other instances, significant repairs will be necessary to restore proper system function. These repairs may consist of enlarging the drainfield; rebuilding a broken distribution box; replacing the septic tank or drainfield; or splitting the wastewater stream so that ""black water"" (predominantly toilet wastes) goes to one septic system and ""gray water"" (predominantly laundry waste) goes to a separate septic system. Get price quotations from septic system contractors. Deal only with contractors who are duly registered by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Check with your county health unit to verify that you are dealing with a properly registered contractor, to make sure that your repairs are being made according to standard, environmentally sound practices, and to ensure that county/state requirements are being followed.  CONCLUSION   We tend to think that our septic system is working as long as the plumbing seems to work and there's no smell in the yard or adjacent ditches. But is it? Environmental contamination may not be apparent and could go undetected for years until a drinking water supply is found to be contaminated — until water quality surveys show nearby lakes to be contaminated, or until other evidence of environmental contamination is assembled. The homeowner should be concerned not only with the hydraulic functioning of the system, but also with its environmental functioning. Ensure that your system is installed and operated in compliance with state and county codes. Have the tank inspected regularly, and pumped when necessary to avoid failure. Your attention to these concerns will help keep your system working properly and protect the environment at the same time. Septic system contractors are registered and regulated by the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. If you have questions about who is properly registered in your area, direct your inquiries to your county health unit (listed in the phone book under County Government). Strive to understand the soils on your land. For information on the soils of your county, contact your Soil and Water Conservation District Office (usually listed under county government), the local office of the Cooperative Extension Service (also under county government), and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (listed under U.S. Department of Agriculture).

(Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.           Contents       1   Description   2   Potential problems   3   Environmental issues   4   See also   5   References   6   External links               [ edit ]   Description   A septic tank generally consists of tanks between the size of 1,000 and 2,000 gallons (4000 - 7500 litres) which is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe at one end and a  septic drain field  at the other. These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

SEPTIC TANK PUMPING SCHEDULE - A Guide to Septic Cleaning - How Often Do You Pump Out A Septic Tank?   Table I below lists the recommended septic tank pumping frequency  according to septic tank capacity and household size. The frequencies were calculated to provide a minimum of 24 hours of wastewater retention assuming 50 percent digestion of the retained solids.     In addition to our article on  HOW TO FIND A SEPTIC TANK , septic system maintenance and repair are discussed in a collection of detailed articles listed at  Septic Tank and Septic System Maintenance .    The removal of  septic waste  by cleaning the septic tank is a critical step in septic system care as it extends the life of the septic field. Even if you don't care   how septic systems work you need to know when to clean the septic tank by pumping out septic waste. Look up your tank size and number   of building occupants to see how often the septic tank should be cleaned.     Table I. Septic Tank Pumping Frequency in Years   .

(This data does not pertain to simple holding tanks which     retain all solid and liquid waste with no treatment no effluent disposal system.)     * These septic tank sizes are below the minimum size allowed  in Pennsylvania and other jurisdictions. Florida septic tank pumping rules and Ohio septic tank     cleaning rules may be more demanding.     Minimum septic tank sizes : Under current Pennsylvania law a 900 gallon septic tank is the minimum size that must be used for a home with     three bedrooms or less. If six people reside in a three-bedroom house, the tank should be pumped every 1.3 years.     If the same system serves a family of two, the tank would be ready for pumping every 5.2 years. Systems installed     before the current rules and regulations were implemented may need to be pumped more often, perhaps every year or less.     Garbage disposers  will increase the frequency of pumping. For example, if this same three bedroom house with six residents had a garbage disposal and was generally producing a higher volume of wastewater, the pumping frequency would be calculated as follows:     1.3 years - [(0.2) x 1.3 years] = 1.0 year. For more analysis of the effect of garbage disposers on septic systems see     Garbage Grinders or Garbage Disposes and Septic Tank Maintenance     Typical Septic Tank Pumping Costs : A typical fee to pump a septic tank is $200. to $300 to pump a septic tank up to 1000g in size, provided     that the tank pumping access port has been uncovered and is readily accessible. If the septic pumping contractor needs to find the septic tank     and then excavate the septic tank pumping access opening, expect to pay an additional $350. to $400. provided that no extraordinary measures     are needed. Prices vary somewhat by region. A part of the fee you're paying your septic pumping contractor is the cost to dispose of     the septage.     Onsite sewage disposal system holding tanks, where there is no septic field, will need to be pumped   more frequently based simply on the rate and volume of septic waste inflow.

clueweb09-enwp02-20-21547	"                     Septic tank          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                       A septic tank before installation                      The same tank partially installed in the ground                      Septic tank and  septic drain field             A  septic tank , the key component of a  septic system , is a small scale  sewage treatment  system common in areas with no connection to main sewage pipes provided by private corporations or local governments. (Other components, typically mandated and/or restricted by local governments, optionally include pumps, alarms,  sand filters , and clarified liquid effluent disposal means such as a  septic drain field , ponds, or  peat moss  beds.) Septic systems are a type of On-Site Sewage Facility ( OSSF ). In  North America  approximately 25% of the population relies on septic tanks; this can include  suburbs  and small towns as well as  rural  areas. ( Indianapolis  is an example of a large city where much of the city's neighborhoods are still on separate septic systems) In Europe they are generally limited to rural areas only.   The term ""septic"" refers to the  anaerobic bacterial  environment that develops in the tank and which decomposes or mineralizes the waste discharged into the tank. Adding a supplemental bacterial agent to the tank may accelerate the digestion of solids in the tank. Septic tanks can be coupled with other  on-site wastewater treatment  units such as  biofilters  or aerobic systems involving artificial forced  aeration . [ 1 ]   Periodic  preventive maintenance  is required to remove the irreducible solids which settle and gradually fill the tank, reducing its efficiency. In most jurisdictions this maintenance is required by law, yet often not enforced. Those who ignore the requirement will eventually be faced with extremely costly repairs when solids escape the tank and destroy the clarified liquid effluent disposal means. A properly cared-for system, on the other hand, can last for decades and possibly a lifetime.

These pipe connections are generally made via a T pipe which allows liquid entry and egress without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today the design of the tank usually incorporates two chambers (each of which is equipped with a manhole cover) which are separated by means of a dividing wall which has openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.   Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float. The settled solids are anaerobically digested reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component flows through the dividing wall into the second chamber where further settlement takes place with the excess liquid then draining in a relatively clear condition from the outlet into the  leach field , also referred to as a drain field, or seepage field, depending upon locality.          Septic tank lift pump alarm system located in a house.       The remaining impurities decompose in the soil, and the water is eliminated through  percolation  into the  soil , and eventually taken up through the  root  system of  plants  or added to the  groundwater . A piping network, often constructed in a stone filled trench (see  weeping tile ), distributes the wastewater throughout the field with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the  leach field  is proportional to the volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone, or where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift  pump .   An  Imhoff tank  is a two-stage septic system where the sludge is digested in a separate tank. This avoids mixing digested sludge with incoming sewage. Also, some septic tank designs have a second stage where the  effluent  from the anaerobic first stage is aerated before it drains into the seepage field.   Waste that is not decomposed by the anaerobic digestion eventually has to be removed from the septic tank, or else the septic tank fills up and undecomposed wastewater discharges directly to the drainage field. Not only is this bad for the environment, but if the sludge overflows the septic tank into the leach field, it may clog the leach field piping or the soil porosity itself, requiring expensive repairs.   How often the septic tank has to be emptied depends on the volume of the tank relative to the input of solids, the amount of indigestible solids and the ambient temperature (as anaerobic digestion occurs more efficiently at higher temperatures). The required frequency varies greatly depending on jurisdiction, usage, and system characteristics. Some health authorities require tanks to be emptied at prescribed intervals, while others leave it up to the determination of the inspector. Some systems require pumping every few years or sooner, while others may be able to go 10-20 years between pumpings. Contrary to what many believe, there is no ""rule of thumb"" for how often tanks should be emptied. An older system with an undersized tank that is being used by a large family will require much more frequent pumping than a new system used by only a few people. Anaerobic decomposition is rapidly re-started when the tank re-fills.   A properly designed and normally operating septic system is odour free and, besides periodic inspection and pumping of the septic tank, should last for decades with no maintenance.   A well designed and maintained concrete, fibreglass or plastic tank should last about 50 years. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Potential problems     Excessive dumping of cooking oils and grease can fill up the upper portion of the septic tank and can cause the inlet drains to block. Oils and grease are often difficult to degrade and can cause odor problems and difficulties with the periodic emptying.   Flushing non-biodegradable hygiene products such as sanitary towels and cotton buds will rapidly fill or clog a septic tank; these materials should not be disposed of in this way.   The use of  waste macerators or grinders  for disposal of waste food can cause a rapid overload of the system and early failure.   Certain chemicals may damage the working of a septic tank, especially pesticides, herbicides, materials with high concentrations of bleach or caustic soda (lye) or any other inorganic materials such as paints or solvents.   Roots from trees and shrubbery growing above the tank or the drain field may clog and or rupture them.   Playgrounds and storage buildings may cause damage to a tank and the drainage field. In addition, covering the drainage field with an impervious surface, such as a driveway or parking area, will seriously affect its efficiency and possibly damage the tank and absorption system.   Excessive water entering the system will overload it and cause it to fail. Checking for plumbing leaks and practising water conservation will help the system's operation.   Even well maintained septic tanks release  mucus -producing anaerobic gut bacteria to the drainage field. The mucus ""slime"" will slowly clog the soil pores surrounding the drain pipe and percolation can slow to the point where backups or surfacing effluent can occur. This slime is called biomat and such a failure is referred to as ""Biomat failure"" [ 3 ] .   If the system is damaged or malfunctions, contact your local health or environmental authority before attempting any repairs. Improper repair can result in costly mistakes and potential health hazards.   Septic tanks by themselves are ineffective at removing  nitrogen  compounds that can cause  algae blooms  in receiving waters; this can be remedied by using a nitrogen-reducing technology. [1]       [ edit ]   Environmental issues   Some pollutants, especially  sulfates , under the anaerobic conditions of septic tanks, are reduced to  hydrogen sulfide , a  pungent  and  toxic  gas. Likewise,  nitrates  and  organic nitrogen compounds  are reduced to  ammonia . Because of the anaerobic conditions,  fermentation  processes take place, which ultimately generate  carbon dioxide  and  methane .   The fermentation processes cause the contents of a septic tank to be anoxic with a low  redox  potential, which keeps  phosphate  in a soluble and thus mobilized form. Because phosphate can be the limiting nutrient for plant growth in many ecosystems, the discharge from a septic tank into the environment can trigger prolific plant growth including algal blooms which can also include blooms of potentially toxic  cyanobacteria .   Soil capacity to retain phosphorus is large compared with the load through a normal residential septic tank. An exception occurs when  septic drain fields  are located in sandy or coarser soils on property adjoining a water body. Because of limited particle surface area, these soils can become saturated with phosphate. Phosphate will progress beyond the treatment area, posing a threat of  eutrophication  to surface waters. [ 4 ]   In areas with high population density, groundwater pollution levels often exceed acceptable limits. Some small towns are facing the costs of building very expensive centralized wastewater treatment systems because of this problem, owing to the high cost of extended collection systems.   To slow development, building moratoriums and limits on the  subdivision  of property are often imposed. Ensuring existing septic tanks are functioning properly can also be helpful for a limited time, but becomes less effective as a primary remediation strategy as population density increases.   Trees in the vicinity of a concrete septic tank have the potential to penetrate the tank as the system ages and the concrete begins to develop cracks and small leaks. Tree roots can cause serious flow problems due to plugging and blockage of drain pipes, but the trees themselves tend to grow extremely vigorously due to the continuous influx of nutrients into the septic system.

SEPTIC INSPECTION WORK SHEETS - Septic System Inspection and Testing Worksheets   Here we provide a series of field worksheets  useful during the conduct of septic system inspections for investigations of the condition of a septic system using level 0, 1, and 2 septic inspections.   Worksheet for Septic Inspection Level 0 - Basic Information               A surprising amount of useful diagnostic information about the condition of a septic tank and drainfield can be developed by a thoughtful visual inspection of the property even before any steps to test the septic system have begun. The two photos above show a case in which an old home-made septic tank was located just a few feet from a public lake. You can see our septic test water pouring into the septic tank in the upper right part of the right hand photo. The jumble of stones visible just inside the septic ""tank"" indicate that this is a home-made system, perhaps simply a cesspool. With the nearby stream and lake just a few feet away, this system is unlikely to be acceptable by modern standards of sanitation and building code. Below we've printed our field data collection worksheets used for septic system inspection.

If a septic mound system or raised bed septic system is installed, a pump may be required to move effluent from a pumping chamber up to the mound treatment area. The presence of a septic mound will be quite obvious but the presence or absence of a pump serving the mound may be less apparent. Look for control boxes, pumping chamber access cover, and of course request whatever information a prior owner may be able to provide - but dont' rely on that data to be complete.

EXPLANATION: At the time of our inspection the sewage disposal system appeared to be working normally and adequately. There was no evidence of stopped main drains, no unusual septic odors. [If a loading/dye test was NOT performed:] By your instruction, we did not perform a system loading and dye test. Important additional information about system condition is available from this and other levels of septic inspection. [There was/was not evidence of recent excavation or repair - which suggests that additional questions to owner or investigation are in order.] [If a loading/dye test was performed:] Report details of dye test procedures (see below), and results.  SEPTIC SYSTEM LOADING AND DYE TEST ON-SITE DETAILS: WATER run at:______________________ for __________ minutes prior to introducing tracer dye.

The first photo shows water running across rock near the reported septic tank location before we began our septic loading test. The second or right-hand photo shows the increase in water running across this rock shortly after we began testing this septic system.

The photo at above left shows a concrete septic tank which has been opened at its inlet baffle to show the baffle top. Sewage on the baffle top tells us that this tank has been subjected to flooding, either because its outlet or absorption field are clogged, or because it has been flooded by excessive sudden inpput (or a blocked baffle). We traced this particular case to ground water entering and flooding the tank during heavy rain - a problem which was corrected quite easily and at low cost.     The second photograph above shows a home made septic tank which was in total  failure, discovered 24 hours after new owners moved into this home. An improper ""septic test"" had been performed by their home  inspector. Even a minimal test, had the inspector run water into the proper drain, would have been likely to discover this  condition as the tank was totally impacted with solid waste and roots. The buyers never had a  chance  to discover this problem  since no proper septic test was performed.    SEPTIC  TANK INSPECTION: (Tank is located and main access is opened if accessible.)

Such as the: American Standard Cadet; Crane Plumbing Economiser; Eljer AquaSaver; Gerber Ultra Flush; Kohler Pressure Lite; Mansfield Quantum; and the Universal-Rundle Corp. Powerflush.             WARNING:  When servicing or replacing components to the FLUSHMATE Flushometer Tank System, make certain that the water supply is turned OFF and the toilet is then flushed to relieve pressure in the vessel. NEVER use lubricants on any of the components unless otherwise noted in instructions.   NEVER use corrosive chemicals or household cleaners on FLUSHMATE products.                            CONDITION:  Water runs on and will not shut off.          A newly installed toilet that does not shut off may have an inadequate or low  water supply flow rate into the FLUSHMATE Vessel.  (NOTE:  The recommended static pressure range by code is 20 P.S.I. to 80 P.S.I.).  Check the water supply pressure as follows:      a)  Turn off the water supply and disconnect the line under the tank.     b)  Place the end of the supply tube into a bucket.     c)   Open the stop completely for 30 seconds.  Measure the amount of water in the bucket (it should be more than a gallon).  When sufficient supply pressure has been verified and the toilet continues to run, the following steps may be required:          Step 1       Make sure supply stop is fully open.              Step 2        Check the Supply Shank for any obstruction what would restrict the supply.                Step 3          Check the Actuator adjustment (see Installation Procedure).                Step 4            Check the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly for proper installation.  Proceed as follows:     a)     Turn off the water supply and flush the toilet.    b)   Remove the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly using pliers' handles as shown in fig. 2.   NOTE:  You may be required to disconnect the trip lever to remove the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly.            Step 5         Reinstall the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly.      NOTE:  First rotate the Cartridge Assembly counter-clockwise approx. 2 full turns (to avoid cross-threading), then screw into place (rotate clockwise) until Cartridge Assembly seats against the discaharge adapter at the bottom of the Tank.  This normally occurs when 2 to 3 Flush Valve Cartridge threads are still showing at the top of the black Vesel;   Do Not overtighten.  Keep the Tank Cover off and turn on the water supply.  Allow the Tank to refill ... total cycle should be 30 to 60 seconds.            Step 6        If the Tank continues to run-on, push down lightly on the Flush Valve Cartridge Stem.  If the water stops running, it is an indication that the Flush Vavle Cartridge still needs further adjustment downward.  If the water still continues to run-on after downward adjustment is made, then the Flush Valve Cartridge requires an upward adjustment.    NOTE:   Adjust the Flush Valve Cartridge Assembly in quarter to half turn increments until the water stops running.  Always turn the water supply off and restart the cycle after each adjustment to insure that proper adjustment has been made.          Step 7        If replacement of the Flush Valve Cartridge is necessary, follow the instructions in Step 5 above.         CONDITION:   Weak or Sluggish Flush               Step 1        Check the water pressure (20psi - 80psi recommended).  If OK, then check the Flush System by removing the Tank Cover and tripping the Actuator.  While the unit is flushing, gently raise the Actuator.  Water should flow freely and wash away any debris in the supply line and Vessel.             Step 2       Test the Air Inducer by tripping the Actuator.  At the end of the flush cycle, when the Vessel starts to refill, count the number os seconds between the Actuator dropping and the reseating of the Air Inducer.  Proper Air Refill requires a minimum of 3 seconds.   NOTE:   It is normal for the Air Inducer to expel a few drops of water with each flush.            To Clean Air Inducer (Figures 3 & 4)                            a)  Turn off the water supply and trip the Actuator.   b)  Unscrew the Air Inducer Cap and clean thoroughly removing any obstructions.  Reassemble.   c)  Turn on water supply.  Wait for the Vessel to refill (45 to 60 seconds).   Repeat ""Step 2) -  Test the Air Inducer"" above.  If the Air Inducer does not function properly, replace the Upper Supply Assembly.             Step 3        To check the Flush Valve Cartridge for leaks, turn the water supply off and drain the Vessel by tripping the Actuator and holding it down until completely drained.  Next, pour a cup of water onto the Cartridge Housing area as shown in Fig. 5.  Turn on the Water supply.  If a leakage is detected (a steady flow of bubbles from the center of the Cartridge Area) the Cartridge should be replaced.             Step 4       Turn the water off and relieve the Vessel pressure by flushing the Toilet.  Remove the supply line located outside the Tank at the bottom left-hand side.  Check for blockages inside the Supply Shank.                    Step 5       Check the main Drain Vent.  A stopped-up bowl, poor drain ventilation or a blocked main will create excessive back pressure, thereby creating a slow flush cycle.  If the drain and drain vent are clear, and the flush has not been improved, replace the Lower Supply Assembly.  Refer to Section: Replacement Procedure for Lower Supply (below).       CONDITION:  No Flush        Step 1          Check the water pressure (20 psi to 80 psi).              Step 2        Review all of Step 3 and 4 covered in ""Weak or Sluggish Flush"" Condition.            Step 3        Check for water in the System by pushing in on the Air Inducer Poppet.  If water comes out, go to Step 4 (next).  If no water comes out, then replace the Pressure Regulator Valve.  Refer to Section: Replacement Procedure or Lower Supply.           Step 4            Replace the Flush Valve Cartridge.  NEVER use lubricant on the ""O""-Ring (Arrow in figure 6)        CONDITION:  Relief  Valve Discharging         This is a sign that the Pressure Regulator Valve, located in the Lower Supply Group (figure 7), is not working properly and should be replaced.  Follow the procedure outlined below:           Steps 1-8            1.  Turn the water supply OFF.   2.  Flush the fixture to relieve pressure in the Vessel.   3.  Disconnect the water supply from the Shank.   4.  Unscrew the plastic locknut that holds the Shank to the bottom of the China Tank.   5.  Carefully pull the entire Lower Supply up and out of the Tank.    NOTE:  DO NOT FORCE  or place a bending load on the Upper Supply.   6.  Cut the Hose just above the Barbed Fitting on the Lower Supply.  Discard old Lower Supply.   7.  Insert new Lower Supply into Hose and secure with new Hose Clamp using pliers.   8.  Carefully replace the entire Supply Group Assembly into the Tank and tighten plastic locknut.
