GX020-47-12658625	"ADVISORY   FROM THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS   Subcommittee on Trade   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, Contact: (202) 225-1721  August 10, 2000  No. TR-23     Crane Announces Hearing on Trade in African Diamonds   Congressman Philip M. Crane (R-IL), Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means, announced today that the Subcommittee will hold a hearing on trade in African  diamonds.   The hearing will take place on Tuesday,  September 12 , 2000, in  the main Committee hearing room, 1100 Longworth  House Office Building, beginning at  10:00 a.m.   Oral testimony at this hearing will be from both invited and public witnesses. Invited witnesses will include officials from the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Also, any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may submit a written statement for consideration by the Committee or for inclusion in the printed record of the hearing.   BACKGROUND :   Recently, there has been intensified international focus on the trade in diamonds and its link to illegal arms trafficking and civil war in Africa.   Often called ""conflict"" or ""blood"" diamonds, such diamonds generally come from mines controlled   by rebel forces and are traded for arms to fuel civil war in Africa.   Many claim that the Sierra Leone rebel organization Revolutionary United Front has engaged in atrocious acts against civilians and has been trading conflict diamonds to finance its war against the Government of Sierra Leone. On July 5, 2000, the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for an 18-month embargo against diamonds from Sierra Leone. The resolution calls on member states to ban the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless those diamonds are exported under a certificate system approved by a Security Council Sanction Committee. This ban is similar to the U.N. embargo implemented against diamonds from Angola in June 1998.   The United States has been actively involved in efforts to curb trade in conflict diamonds. In May 2000 in Kimberly, South Africa, the United States, along with South Africa, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and representatives of the diamond industry reached an agreement on key issues establishing a certification system, accountability and oversight for the industry. The United States has also taken a lead in establishing Sierra Leone's Commission on the Management of Strategic Resources and has committed over $1 million as well as technical advice for this effort.   In response to the international focus on conflict diamond trade and the U.N. ban against diamonds from Sierra Leone, the World Diamond Congress (comprised of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association) adopted on July 19, 2000, a joint resolution laying out a proposal for oversight, accountability and specific actions to track the flow of rough diamonds. The proposal requires each accredited rough diamond importing country to enact ""redline"" legislation prohibiting the importation of any parcel of rough diamonds unless such parcel has been sealed and registered in a universally standardized manner by an accredited export authority from the exporting country. In addition, the proposal does the following: (1) calls for the exporting country to implement an accredited export system; (2) prohibits the importation of diamonds from countries that have not enacted redline legislation; (3) requires countries to adopt criminal penalties for trading in illicit rough diamonds; and (4) requires adherence to a code of conduct. Under the proposal, compliance is to be monitored and controlled by the industry, the International Diamond Council.   Under U.S. law, the origin of a cut diamond is the country where the diamond was cut, and U.S. Customs does not require any information relating to the country of mining of the imported cut diamond. Most experts agree that once a diamond has been cut and polished, it is difficult to determine the country where it was mined.   There have been a number of legislative proposals in Congress seeking to address the trade in conflict diamonds, including banning diamonds from specified countries and requiring a certification of where the diamond sought to be imported was mined. These proposals have not received the support of the Administration, largely because of concerns that they are not administrable and have the potential to harm legitimate diamond trade.   In announcing the hearing, Chairman Crane stated: ""This hearing will provide the Subcommittee with an opportunity to review the options available to curtail conflict diamond trade that are World Trade Organization (WTO) consistent and do not impact legitimate diamond trade. We must break the link that makes diamonds a rebel's best friend, but we must also not harm legitimate diamond trade that is a vital link to the world's economy.""   FOCUS OF THE HEARING:   The focus of the hearing will be to evaluate options available that are administrable and WTO consistent and will effectively curtail conflict diamond trade without impacting legitimate diamond trade. The Subcommittee is interested in receiving testimony on possible approaches to this issue, including testimony on current and developing technology that can determine the country of mining of a cut and polished diamond.

Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. However, recent reports of Iranian meddling in post-Taliban Afghanistan and Iran's intercepted January 2002 shipment of arms allegedly to the Palestinian Authority have reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The President has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and its nuclear program is advancing with Russia's help. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Islamic-oriented Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have strongly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern, although neither the Clinton nor the Bush Administrations cited progress as a specific condition for an improvement in relations. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of U.S. policy appears to be containment. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). The sanctions were intended to deny Iran the material resources to threaten U.S. interests. In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, in 1999 and 2000 the Clinton Administration and Congress eased sanctions somewhat to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of luxury consumer goods, such as carpets. However, the United States continues to work with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. Legislation to renew ILSA for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  03-12-02  MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Legislation to renew the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24). The thawing of U.S.-Iran relations reversed in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and over Iranian efforts to exert influence on the new Afghan government. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major potential threats to U.S. national security.  BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi has expressed frustration that his reform program has been obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who use their control of key levers of power to prevent a loosening of domestic restrictions or moderation of foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 40 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors. In February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet said Iran's reform movement may be ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners. Iran arrested student reformers in late February 2002, a blow to the reform movement.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear to be rising again. Equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to temporarily block the Strait of Hormuz or disrupt international shipping, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 CRS-1   IB93033  03-12-02  million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). See CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. U.S. government proliferation reports, including a February 2002 CIA report covering January - June 2001, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. The foreign assistance continued despite U.S. anti-proliferation efforts through multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, and Australia Group. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Two more Chinese entities (Liyang Chemical Equipment and China Machinery and Electric Equipment Import-Export Co.) and one individual (Q.C.Chen) were sanctioned under the Act in January 2002 for alleged export to Iran of chemical and biological technology. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Although two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), U.S. intelligence officials said publicly in August 2001 that Iran will soon ""field"" the Shahab-3. At least one defense publication said in mid-October 2001 that Iran had launched serial production of the Shahab-3. Iran is also developing a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, and it has publicly mentioned an even longer- range Shahab-5, although development of the Shahab-5 apparently has not begun, according to U.S. reports. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran will likely field an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. CIA reports to and testimony before Congress in February CRS-2   IB93033  03-12-02  2002 cast doubt that China is upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. On February 22, 2002, the Washington Times reported that China had delivered HQ-7 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. In late February 2002, the United States and Russia differed sharply over U.S. allegations that Russian entities are continuing to give Iran missile technology. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade, and sooner if it gets such material from outside. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2002. In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build additional reactors. The February 2002 CIA report to Congress, covered January - June 2001, says that some Iran-China interactions raise questions about China's adherence to its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran is mulling accepting more stringent inspections. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106-429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2000, released April 30, 2001, states that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2000,"" although the report attributed that activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaida. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  CRS-3   IB93033  03-12-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. Saudi officials announced that the 11 Saudi suspects who are in custody in Saudi Arabia would be tried in Saudi courts and not turned over to U.S. justice. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but relations have improved dramatically over the past few years. Since early 1998, the two have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 19801988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities generally cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally prevented such shipments. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime, and Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001. CRS-4   IB93033  03-12-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. These groups have escalated attacks on Israel since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting a conference of anti-peace process organizations on April 24, 2001: the conference served as a platform for Iranian statements against Israel that the United States called ""outrageous and intolerable."" Khamene'i told the meeting that Israelis had exaggerated the Holocaust to justify ""crimes"" against the Palestinians. Khamene'i said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final IsraeliPalestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by joining them in pledging continued support to anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority. The arms could be used for terrorism or for conventional combat capabilities. About 100 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate arms deliveries to Hizballah, and the Los Angeles Times reported on May 6, 2001 that the United States, in late 2000, succeeded in persuading Turkey to prevent Iran from flying over Turkish airspace to Syria, thereby denying Iran an easy route for resupplying Hizballah. Even though the United Nations certified Israel's May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon as complete, Hizballah occasionally attacks Israel in the Shebaa Farms border area that Israel controls and that Hizballah claims constitutes occupied Lebanese territory. Iran publicly supported Hizballah's ambush and capture of three Israeli soldiers and one alleged Israeli agent in October 2000, all in that area. (H.Res. 99 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, Syria, and Lebanon pressure Hizballah to allow visitations to the four captives by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The measure passed the House on June 25, 2001.) In late October 2001, Israel announced it believed the three captured soldiers had died. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002 said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. Israel asserted in February 2002 that Iran had 8,000 Katyusha rockets to Hizballah recently, but the Israeli claim could not be confirmed. On May 10, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that the March 17, 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was the work of Hizballah. On September 2, 1999, Argentina issued an arrest warrant for senior Hizballah guerrilla leader Imad Mughniyah in connection with it. An Argentine judge has also accused Iran and Hizballah of a July 18, 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires; 20 alleged Argentine CRS-5   IB93033  03-12-02  accomplices have been arrested and their trial began in late September 2001, but the main suspects are still at large. H.Res. 531 and S.Res. 329, calling on Argentina to step up the investigation of the 1994 bombing, were passed by their full chambers on July 17 and July 19, 2000, respectively. In May 2001, an FBI team traveled to Argentina to help with the AMIA investigation. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed as Sudan has sought to achieve removal from the terrorism list.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. Iran does not appear to be supporting radical Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Central Asian countries (with the possible exception of Tajikistan) or in Russia's Dagestan and Chechnya regions, but Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly allows anti-Uzbekistan activists access to Iran's state radio. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and pledged to allow U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials have called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive."" Some of Iran's activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and CRS-6   IB93033  03-12-02  northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. Amid press reports in January 2002 that Iran might be harboring some Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan, President Bush warned Iran against such activity. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai in which the two countries agreed to cooperate broadly. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received CRS-7   IB93033  03-12-02  sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. A second was released on January 16, 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but the rift appears to be starting to close somewhat. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington through the Embassy of Pakistan, staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches.  CRS-8   IB93033  03-12-02  Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. However, Iran continued to refuse to engage in official, bilateral talks until at least some U.S. sanctions are lifted. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for re-establishing relations with the United States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed as of January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become far more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. In subsequent comments, the President and his aides said that the United States would still be willing to hold dialogue with Iran and that the President was implying he wanted Iran's behavior to change, not threatening military action against Iran.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran is also barred from sales of U.S. munitions list items because it has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act also penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries. Proliferation Sanctions. Some of these sanctions are discussed above, and two laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items. It also imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology, to Iran. Although progress with Russia has ebbed and flowed, Congress has sought stronger steps to end the missile assistance to Iran. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's CRS-9   IB93033  03-12-02  WMD programs. It also bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a caseby-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar. Regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for CRS-10   IB93033 Iranian Iranian of that carpets  03-12-02  carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market.  The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was scheduled to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). For further discussion of ILSA and its renewal, see CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline project s that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum; a detailed engineering study is under way. In a potential setback to it, in mid-2001 Kazakhstan began pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy and allow routes through Iran; Powell reiterated U.S. policy but did not reject the request outright. Russia, which seeks to route oil and gas lines through it, reportedly also favors a route through Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the Khatemi era U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, CRS-11   IB93033  03-12-02  1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $7 billion as of December 2001, according to Iran's Central Bank. Iran plans to retire about half of this remaining debt by March 2002. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In October 1999, Dutch banks extended $2 billion in credits to investors in Iran. In July 2000, Germany increased its export insurance cover from $100 million to $500 million in conjunction with Khatemi's visit there. In July 2001, France's Societe Generale de France extended a $1 billion credit line to a group of Iranian commercial banks. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. Multilateral Lending to Iran/WTO. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted CRS-12   IB93033  03-12-02  its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform strategy for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the actual loans is expected in the spring of 2002. WTO. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Related Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997). Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 CRS-13   IB93033  03-12-02  for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1982 Hizbollah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizbollah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In mid-October 2001, the Bush Administration asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit against Iran by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107-117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  CRS-14   IB93033  03-12-02  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. For further information on the PMOI, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Iran continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are frequently criticized by U.S. officials and Members of Congress. Thus far, the Bush Administration has continued most aspects of the containment policies toward Iran that characterized preceding administrations. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  While continuing previous U.S. Administrations' policies of containing Iran while pursuing limited engagement with it, the the Bush Administration is evaluating whether or not to move more toward a regime change policy, and how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. During the late 1990s, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in broad, official talks. Relations took another downturn when Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The grouping came despite Iran's tacit cooperation with the United States against the Taliban in the post-September 11, 2001 war in Afghanistan. Iran was also quietly helpful in the U.S. effort to oust Iraq's Saddam Hussein in 2003, although Iran reportedly is supporting Shiite Islamic factions there that could greatly boost Iran's influence in post-war Iraq. Some Al Qaeda activists are in Iran as well, although Iran claims some are ""in custody."" The Bush Administration has warned Iran not to meddle in Iraq, to extradite any Al Qaeda in Iran, and to curb its nuclear program. The Bush Administration has sought to dampen speculation that the United States might take major military action against Iran to change its regime, but it has indicated support for demonstrators and others in Iran who call for major internal changes. Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, have long been key U.S. concerns. The concerns have been heightened recently by reported major strides in Iran's nuclear program.  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  07-25-03  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  A visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the newly revealed Natanz facility on February 21 found that the facility contained a more advanced uranium enrichment program than was expected. A June 6, 2003 IAEA report strongly criticized Iran for lack of candor on its nuclear program, and President Bush said on June 18 that the United States would ""not tolerate"" construction of an Iranian nuclear weapon. During June 6 - 18, students in Tehran and other major cities demonstrated for major political reform. On July 23, 2003, Iranian officials said they are holding at least one senior Al Qaeda figure.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  The debate over U.S. policy toward Iran centers on a number of options for changing Iran's regime or modify its behavior; curbing its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs; and limiting or end its support for terrorist groups. Options include engagement, additional U.S. or international sanctions, military action, and supporting opposition forces.  Regime Power Struggle and the Opposition The United States does not have a declared policy of changing Iran's regime, although adopting such a stance reportedly is under consideration by the Bush Administration. Some who favor a regime change policy point to a growing movement by pro-reform elements against the more conservative clerics that dominate Iran's top leadership. Since February 2002, DCI George Tenet has been saying that Iran's reform movement is ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini) who controls key institutions such as the Council of Guardians and the military. Since mid-2002, the elected reformist President Mohammad Khatemi has become more vocal in criticizing obstructions by hardliners, and in late August 2002, he proposed new legislation that would strengthen the power of his office; it was passed by the Majlis but has not yet been approved by the conservative-dominated legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Since early 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. Khatemi suffered a political setback in February 28, 2003, local elections, with hardliners winning most of the seats in Tehran in a low turnout (14% in Tehran) election that suggested reformist disillusionment at the slow pace of reform thus far. Khatemi, who was re-elected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, remains popular, by most accounts. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters have held about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) since their victory in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. Indications of popular dissatisfaction re-surfaced on June 12, 2003, with student-led protests in major cities, lasting about six days, calling for major reforms, including limitations on the powers of the Supreme Leader. Some protesters called for Khatami to resign for being ineffective in promoting reform. President Bush issued statements in CRS-1   IB93033  07-25-03  support of the demonstrators, although Secretary of State Powell said the protests represented a ""family fight"" within Iran in which the United States should not seek a role. Press reports say as many as four students might have been killed by regime security forces during the days of protest. Exiled Oppositionists. Others believe that the United States should support exiled opposition groups, which seek outright replacement rather than reform of the current regime. No exile group is currently funded by the United States. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration called the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998, and has become, as of December 2002, Radio Farda (""Tomorrow"" in Farsi), which broadcasts nearly around the clock. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (P.L. 105-277). Another U.S.-sponsored television broadcast service to Iran, under the auspices of the Voice of America, began operations on July 3, 2003. Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and the NCR was named as an alias of the PMOI in the October 1999 re-designations. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. U.S. forces attacked PMOI military installations in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and, after temporarily agreeing to a ceasefire with PMOI military elements in Iraq, subsequently demanded their surrender and disarmament. Press reports in late May 2003 say some Administration officials, particularly in the Defense Department, want the group removed from the FTO list and a U.S. alliance with the group against the Tehran regime. On June 17, 2003 France arrested about 170 PMOI members, including its co-leader Maryam Rajavi (wife of PMOI founder Masoud Rajavi, who is based in Iraq.) She was subsequently released. For further information, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 44 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from stations in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts, although he is not believed to have a major following in Iran.  CRS-2   IB93033  07-25-03  Iran's Strategic Capabilities Fo the past two decades, the United States has sought to contain the strategic threat posed by Iran's WMD programs and its support of terrorist groups. Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, are making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and forces at risk.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. According to U.S. military officials, Iran's forces could block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs continue to be assisted Russia, China, and North Korea. For further information, see CRS Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Suppliers. President Bush, in his an ""axis of evil"" along primarily by entities in Report RL30551, Iran:  Nuclear Program. U.S. and European concerns are growing about the scope of Iran's nuclear program, despite Iran's occasional voluntary revelations about its facilities. On June 18, 2003, President Bush stated that the United States would ""not tolerate construction"" of a nuclear weapon by Iran. In response to allegations by Iran's exiled opposition, Iran acknowledged in December 2002 that it is building two additional facilities, at Arak and Natanz, that could be used to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Natanz could produce enriched uranium by 2005, and the Arak facility reportedly is a heavy water reactor that could be used to produce plutonium. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Mohammad Baradei visited the Natanz site on February 21, 2003, and his report of June 6, 2003, formally discussed by the IAEA on June 18, 2003, was highly critical of Iran, citing that Natanz was an advanced uranium enrichment facility and that Iran had hidden other aspects of its nuclear program, such as importation of uranium. The report stopped short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT. The Bush Administration has asserted that it believes Iran is working toward a nuclear weapons capability and that it is in violation of its obligations under the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), questioning Iran's assertion that the sites are for electricity generation purposes only. The revelations mean Iran might produce a nuclear weapon ""toward the end of the decade,"" somewhat sooner than the ""end of the decade"" previously stated. Despite the stepped up international attention and European and other support for the U.S. position, Iran is still refusing the IAEA's urging that it sign the ""Additional Protocol"" to the NPT, which would allow no-notice inspections, but it has pledged to inform the IAEA in advance of constructing any new nuclear facilities. Russia, according to some observers, has suspended work, under a January 1995 contract with Iran, to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The plant is to be operational by the end of 2003. Russia says that it has CRS-3   IB93033  07-25-03  reached agreement with Iran to supply fuel for the reactor for ten years and for Russia to reprocess the plant's spent nuclear material, but the new revelations have apparently made Russia more skeptical of Iran's promises. Some press reports indicate that military action against Iran's nuclear facilities might be considered if diplomacy fails to halt Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Chemical and Biological Weapons. Official U.S. reports state that Iran is seeking a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, mainly from Chinese sources, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. The reports say Iran may have some capability to produce biological agents, but that its ability to weaponize them is limited. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful series of final tests in June 2003, subsequently calling the missile operational and formally delivering five of them to the Revolutionary Guard. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile. (For more information, see CRS Report RS21548, Iran's Ballistic Missile Capabilities.)  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's support for terrorist groups has long concerned U.S. Administrations, particularly by giving Tehran an opportunity to try to obstruct the U.S.-led Middle East peace process. Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2002, released April 30, 2003, again stated, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2002,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions: the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL31533, Persian Gulf States: Post-War Issues for U.S. Policy, 2003. CRS-4   IB93033  07-25-03  Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well but has not done so. The exchanges suggest that Saudi Arabia has tried to move beyond the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen, and was believed orchestrated by Iranian agents. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for that bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE have been strained since April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, completely seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, and it seized part of Abu Musa that year from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE tensions have eased, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military control over the islands, supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Iraq. Senior U.S. officials have, on several occasions since the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003, warned Iran not to interfere in post-war Iraq to try to establish a proIranian Islamic republic there. Iran has ties to several Shiite Islamic groups that are gaining influence over southern Iraq, despite lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, a legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988). Iran had publicly opposed a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq because it was not authorized by the United Nations, but it tacitly backed the war in the hope that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. Tehran has long supported Shiite militants in southern Iraq, particularly the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and the Da'wa (Islamic Call) party. SCIRI is headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim, the late Ayatollah Khomeini's choice to head an Islamic republic in Iraq, who returned to Iraq on May 10, 2003. In the political vacuum left by the ousting of the Baath regime of Iraq, these and similar parties have seized control over many of the towns and cities of southern Iraq. SCIRI loyalists from its armed wing are called the ""Badr Corps."" Iran denies that it is ""meddling"" in Iraq's affairs, saying that longtime Iraqi activists have returned to Iran to participate in the politics of postSaddam Iraq. (For more information on Shiite and other contender for power in Iraq, see CRS Report RL31339, Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts and Post-War Governance.) Over the past five years, Saddam Hussein had sought to improve relations with Iran to reduce Iraq's regional isolation. Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq exchanged almost all remaining prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in agreement to abide by the waterwaysharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior CRS-5   IB93033  07-25-03  to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's naval forces sometimes cooperated with Iraq's illicit export of oil through the Gulf.  Middle East/North Africa Many of the U.S. concerns about Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of anti-peace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, 2002, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block any final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the PA, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Lebanon/Hizballah. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, in 2002, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. Hizballah is believed to take cues from harder line Iranian elements. In mid May 2003, Khatemi made the first top level Iranian visit to Lebanon since the 1979 revolution. On March 11, an Argentinian judge issued arrest warrants for four Iranian diplomats, including former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, for alleged complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. Hizballah is believed to have committed the act, as well as the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in that city.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology. Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan, even though its population, like Iran, adheres to Shiite Islam. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one antiAzerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev.  CRS-6   IB93033  07-25-03  Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft threatened a British Petroleum (BP) ship on contract to Azerbaijan out of an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called that action provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Iran-Azerbaijan tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Iran tacitly supported the U.S.-led war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and it is moving to restore Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan. U.S. charges on this issue were renewed after the May 12, 2003 bombings in Riyadh, believed conducted by Al Qaeda, against four expatriate housing complexes. Following the U.S. criticism, Iran said it had arrested several low-level Al Qaeda activists and reiterated its position that Iran has long been an enemy of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. On July 23, 2003, Iranian officials, for the first time, asserted Iran had ""in custody"" senior Al Qaeda figures, purported to include Al Qaeda spokesman Sulayman Abu Ghaith or top operative Sayf Al Adl. U.S. officials say they are not certain that Iran is actually holding the Al Qaeda figures or is willing to turn them over to their countries of origin. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002, visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  CRS-7   IB93033  07-25-03  Human Rights Concerns Iran's human rights practices have been a source of concern to recent U.S. Administrations, although U.S. policy has not generally considered Iran's human rights record as a strategic threat to U.S. interests or an obstacle to the beginning of a U.S.-Iran dialogue. U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners, and the U.S. State Department report for 2002, released in March 2003, said Iran's human rights situation had deteriorated further in the past year. On July 24, Canada withdrew its Ambassador from Iran in response to the apparent beating death while in Iranian detention of a Canadian journalist of Iranian origin, Zahra Kazemi. She had been detained in early July 2003 for filming outside Tehran's Evin prison. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-2003. On January 30, 2003, Iran released the 80-year-old Ayatollah Montazeri, from house arrest; Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor until being dismissed by Khomeini in 1989, and he has emerged as a critic of the current leadership. In the 108th Congress, resolutions (S.Res. 82 and H.Res. 140) were introduced on March 12, 2003, expressing concern over Iran's human rights record, particularly its treatment of women. Religious Persecution. In October 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act, and little progress in Iran's performance on this issue was noted in the October 2002 religious freedom report. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three other Bahais. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002; and three more were given early release in October 2002. Iran said on April 24, 2003, that the remaining five had been released. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for CRS-8   IB93033  07-25-03  linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S.-Iran Relations and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but there have been periods over the past five years in which a significant thawing appeared imminent. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had only limited official dialogue since. An exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy toward engagement; the Clinton Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out direct talks. In a June 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran called the steps insufficient to warrant direct dialogue. In September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran said that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. In October 2001, several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. Relations worsened again in January 2002 over allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan, and President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his January 2002 State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians demonstrating for reform CRS-9   IB93033  07-25-03  and democracy, a message he reiterated on December 20, 2002 when he inaugurated a new U.S. broadcast to Iran, Radio Farda (""Tomorrow"" in Farsi). The statements signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists, possibly a step toward a regime change policy for Iran. This apparent shift, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, has been mirrored in Congress. Two resolutions introduced in late July 2002 (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" A Senate bill, S. 1082, introduced May 19, 2003 by Senator Sam Brownback, is widely interpreted as urging support for the Shah's son (see above) by calling for the use of some U.S. funds for broadcasting and democratization in the Middle East to be used to promote the Shah's son's ideas for the holding of an internationally-monitored democratic referendum in Iran. A House bill (H.R. 2466) contains similar provisions and adds a section reimposing import sanctions on luxury goods from Iran. The sentiments of some of these bills were incorporated into provisions of the House version of the FY2004 foreign relations authorization bill (H.R. 1950), particularly sections calling on the Administration to try to block international lending to Iran (see also below). Despite the apparent policy shift, in May 2003 both countries acknowledged that they were conducting direct talks in Geneva on Afghanistan and Iraq. This marked the first confirmed direct dialogue. However, Iran said the talks did not indicate that the two countries were on the verge of restoring diplomatic relations. The United States broke off the channel, at least temporarily, following the May 12, 2003, bombing in Riyadh that some press reports say might have been planned by Al Qaeda activists located in Iran. Senior Administration officials reportedly are discussing U.S. policy options, including regime change, military action, the future of the U.S.-Iran dialogue, and the IAEA assessment of Iran's nuclear program on May 29, 2003, but the outcome of the deliberations, if any, has not been announced. Possibility of Military Action. The aftermath of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, coupled with heightened U.S. concerns about Iran's WMD programs and links to terrorism, has led to speculation that Iran might be a future target of U.S. military action. President Bush reportedly told leaders at the June 2003 G-8 summit of industrialized countries that the United States is not contemplating major military action against Iran at this time. However, experts say that the Administration is considering a number of options, most of which are diplomatic but some of which might include certain military actions such as airstrikes, to end or slow Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces in the Gulf region could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. No military tensions are currently evident, and U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. CRS-10   IB93033  07-25-03  Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Hizballah, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran also has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 - 2003, a number of entities in North Korea, China, India, Armenia, and Moldova were sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the IranIraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. In late May 2003, the Bush Administration sanctioned a major Chinese industrial entity, Norinco, for allegedly selling missile technology to Iran. On July 4, 2003, an additional Chinese entity, the Taian Foreign Trade General Corporation, was sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Each March since 1995, most recently on March 13, 2003, the U.S. Administration has renewed a declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. CRS-11   IB93033  07-25-03  An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747s (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees are available and U.S. exporters are not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contained a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. Neither the Clinton Administration nor the Bush Administration has provided the credit guarantees. In the March 2000 speech mentioned above, the trade ban was eased to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, but U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (over 300%) dampened imports of that product. In January 2003, the tariff on roasted pistachios was lowered to 22% and on raw pistachios to 163%. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996) is a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector. It was to sunset on August 5, 2001, but it was renewed for another five years (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24, signed August 3, 2001). The renewal law requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months (as early as August 2003). No sanctions have been imposed under ILSA, although three companies involved in one project (South Pars) were deemed in violation in September 1998; sanctions were waived. A number of other investments have remained ""under review"" for ILSA sanctions since 1999. In October 2002, Norway's Statoil agreed to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight of the South Pars gas field. As noted below (Japan section), a deal to develop the Azadegan field ($2 billion investment) is expected, as is the outcome of a competition between BP and Totalfina Elf to develop the Bangestan field (also about $2 billion). Foreign firms have invested about $15 billion in Iran's energy sector since Iran opened it to investment. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Bush Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects through Iran. U.S. policy has been to promote construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian CRS-12   IB93033  07-25-03  Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline); the policy appeared to bear fruit when four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999. Regional and corporate support for the project subsequently gained momentum and the early stages of pipeline construction have begun. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed in the late 1990s in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial (""Mykonos trial"") that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. On December 12, 2002, Iran and the EU began formal negotiations on a trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, with some linkage to Iran addressing EU concerns on Iran's human rights practices and terrorism sponsorship. However, recent revelations about Iran's possible nuclear weapons ambitions have caused the EU to become more cautious in approaching Iran; on July 21, 2003, EU foreign ministers warned Iran they would ""review"" relations unless Iran accepted more intrusive IAEA inspections. They also expressed concern about Iran's human rights record. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further CRS-13   IB93033  07-25-03  during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field. A $2 billion deal to develop that field was expected by June 30, 2003, but Japan's firms did not reach an agreement by that deadline, partly in protest of Iran's nuclear program, leaving the status of that deal unclear. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan has refused to extend to Iran new official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, as well as the foreign aid appropriations for FY1995 (P.L. 103-326) and FY1996 (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank began considering a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in July 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since then, the WTO, at U.S. urging, has postponed discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran.  CRS-14   IB93033  07-25-03  Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran views the issue of disputed claims and blocked assets as an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account, and about $22 million in diplomatic property remains blocked. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. On May 30, 2003, federal judge Royce Lambert ruled that Iran was behind the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, in response to a 2001 lawsuit filed on behalf of over 600 people who lost family members in that bombing. For information on suits against Iran that have been filed, their outcomes, and legislation regarding these suits, see CRS Report RL31258, Suits Against Terrorism States by Victims of Terrorism. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  CRS-15"

Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.     e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial  The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.  The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.  The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing, in time to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.  There were no reports of political prisoners.     f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence  The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.  Section 2    Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:     a.   Freedom of Speech and Press  The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.     b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     c.   Freedom of Religion  Although the official state religion is Lutheran, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.     d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.  Section 3   Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government  The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held on April 8.  There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics.  Two of the four top governmental positions-- the President and the Speaker of the Althing--are occupied by women (both positions are largely ceremonial, however).  There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.    Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights  A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.  Section 5   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status  The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.  Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude, but credible reports indicate that both the police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to rape victims (see below).     Women  Violence against women received increasing public attention, due largely to the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which continued to raise it in political debate.  A public women's shelter offers protection to approximately 350 women and 180 children per year; these figures are virtually the same as in 1994, indicating a leveling off of an initial surge in demand for services of the shelter.  There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children annually seek assistance there.  Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments and private contributions.  The Reykjavik   City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to care for rape victims.  Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving domestic violence or sexual abuse (rape, attempted rape, or harassment) are reported to the police.  Women's organizations assert that both the state investigative police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse; that female victims who lodge charges of such offenses are often subjected to humiliating police interrogation; and that judges are unduly lenient with sex offenders (the typical prison term for a convicted rapist is 1 or 2 years).  The police have introduced a program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures, and other government agencies are paying closer attention to the problem of violence against women.  In September an all-male committee, working under the auspices of the Social Affairs Ministry, launched a 2-week campaign, ""Men against Violence,"" highlighting men's responsibility for the majority of domestic and sexual violence, and sponsoring seminars on the problem and ways to eliminate it.  Major economic and political institutions remain male-dominated.  Legislation requiring equal pay for equal work is evidently not being adequately implemented.  Studies have consistently revealed an average difference of 40 percent in the earnings of men and women in comparable jobs; when allowance is made for the longer average working hours (and overtime) among men, there remains a 20-percent gap.  Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs.  The committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to any employer do not have the force of law.  Only a few complaints have been made to the committee.  Women's groups speculate that many women are reluctant to come forward with complaints in Iceland's small, intimate communities and traditionally stoic culture.  Also, Iceland's largely male-led labor unions have not actively supported individual women who wish to exercise their right to take action on such matters.     Children  Great respect for children's rights is evident in the law and in government policy.  In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.  Some international custody cases involving Icelanders have been complicated by the fact that, although Iceland is a signatory to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, it has not been brought into force.  The Foreign Minister opined that Iceland's practices in this area lay it open to criticism for possible violations of human rights.  In 1994 the Foreign Minister submitted a bill in the Parliament to bring the Convention into force, but it was not voted on before the end of the session.  The bill was reintroduced early in the new parliamentary term, which began in October.     People with Disabilities  Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services.  The Government has legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.  Section 6   Worker Rights     a.   The Right of Association  Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are not controlled by the Government or any single political party.  Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.     b.   The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively  There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice.  Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively.  The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions.  The Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together.  Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.  In June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Government had violated the 11th article of the European Human Rights Charter, concerning the right of free association, by obliging taxi drivers to be members of a union.  The new   Parliament is continuing to consider legislation to comply with this judgment.  There are no export processing or other special economic zones.     c.   Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor  Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and does not occur.     d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children  The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This prohibition is observed in practice.  Children age 14 or 15 may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work; their workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.     e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work  Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest- paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.    Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.  Worktime exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

GX030-93-0446708	Human Rights Practices for 1998 Report                   Released by the Bureau of Democracy,                   Human Rights, and Labor                   U.S. Department of State                                                         ICELAND COUNTRY REPORT                                          February 1999                                                                                                                    TOC  |   Preface  |   Introduction  |   Africa  |  East Asia  |   Europe  |   Latin America  |   Near East  |  South Asia  |   Appendixes                     Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders. The judiciary is independent.  Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.  Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold private property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 70 percent of export revenues.  The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has begun to address.  RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:   a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing  There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.  b. Disappearance  There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.  c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.  Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government permits visits by human rights monitors. While many prisons are near capacity, the Government has over the past year modernized and expanded existing facilities.  d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.  e. Denial of Fair Public Trial  The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.  The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.  The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.  There were no reports of political prisoners.  f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence  The Constitution prohibits such practices and the Government generally respect these prohibitions. Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.  Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:   a. Freedom of Speech and Press  The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.  b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.  c. Freedom of Religion  Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.  d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1998. In addition to the total of  50 refugees from the former Yugoslavia that Iceland accepted in 1996 and 1997, 23 were settled in the northern town of Blondous in June. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees are being settled have taken a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment, including providing Icelandic language classes and jobs.  Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.  There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics. There is one woman in the cabinet. Women hold 17 of the 63 seats in Parliament. There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections. One of the three female Parliamentarians left the Women's List in 1998 due to differences over the future of the movement, thereby reducing the Women's List to 2 seats.  Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.  Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude.  Women  Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffer sentences for sex offenders. The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.  There is a public, women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims. During the year the emergency ward reported 101 visits associated with incidents of rape or sexual abuse, 97 by women and 4 by men. Hospital officials estimate that only 51 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial. Officials attribute this low percentage to fear of publicity in such a small, tightly knit society.  With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there has been concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into Icelandic society. Concern that these women might be vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to establish a special Center for Immigrant Women, which focuses on providing information on their legal rights, and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms, as well as language training.  Iceland's largest political party, the center-right Independence Party, has begun addressing women's issues as a priority in response to growing public awareness stimulated by the Women's List political movement and the efforts of the recently reelected female mayor of Reykjavik to put women's issues at the forefront. While major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. There remains about a 20 percent gap in earnings between men and women in comparable jobs nationally, although the gap in Reykjavik is less, at around 10 to 15 percent.  Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the committee.  Children  The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.  There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.  People With Disabilities  Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has legislated accessibility for the disabled to public buildings.  Section 6 Worker Rights   a. The Right of Association  Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Approximately 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.  b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively  There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, work hours, and other conditions. The Government often plays a role in the negotiations and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.  In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  There are no export processing or other special economic zones.  c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor  Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur. The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.  d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment  The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work- hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.  e. Acceptable Conditions of Work  Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.  Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is considered a violation of the law.

GX033-09-16697746	"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1999                   Released by the Bureau of Democracy,                   Human Rights, and Labor                   U.S. Department of State                                                        ICELAND                                          February 2000                                                                                                                  TOC  |   Preface  |   Introduction  |   Africa  |  East Asia  |   Europe  |   Latin America  |   Near East  |  South Asia  |   Appendixes                   Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections.  The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living.  The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues.  An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting.  Aluminum is the second leading export.  Growth was expected to exceed 5 percent in 1999.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.  Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners.  The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women.  Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay.  Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1:     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:        a.     Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing   There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.        b.     Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.  c.     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.     Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards.     In a February report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to the main prison (Litla Hraun) in Reykjavik in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were being placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation.  While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months.  While in solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except for short periods of time to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers and prison officials.  In November the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.   In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation.  On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence.  However, the Prison and Probation Administration's own statistics show that solitary confinement was the rule rather than the exception during the first 9 months of the year:  more than 90 percent of the 87 persons taken into custody were put into solitary confinement at least initially.   With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population.  Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe.  Construction of a new prison in Reykjavik is planned for these detainees.   Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences, or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail.  In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they must be confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles.  In its February report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults.""   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.        d.     Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.        e.     Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   There are two levels of courts.  The Ministry of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process.  Depending on the seriousness of the charges, a panel can include from three to five judges.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f.     Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the Government  generally respect these prohibitions.  Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2:     Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:        a.     Freedom of Speech and PressThe Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.        b.     Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.        c.     Freedom of Religion   Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.  The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state.  Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment.  The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland.  Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.   d.     Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     Although neither the Constitution nor the law include provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  There were no reports of the forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.  In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises.  However, the Government reported that 13 individuals arrived during the year and requested asylum.  None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under review), but some were granted temporary entry on humanitarian grounds.  Some human rights monitors criticized the arrest and prolonged detention of a Kurdish asylum-seeker, but the Directorate of Immigration, which has responsibility for processing applications for asylum, stated that it had no choice but to turn the individual over to the police for investigation because he had no identity or travel documents and refused to cooperate with the authorities.   The Directorate of Immigration, which traditionally was a part of the national police force, became an independent agency on October 1.  The Directorate is responsible for issuing passports, visas, and residence permits and for processing applications for asylum, while the police and customs now have responsibility for manning passport control points for those coming into and going out of the country.  However, the police and customs are required to consult with the Directorate of Immigration about individuals arriving without valid visas or passports before refusing them entry.  Human rights monitors say that it appears that some of the individuals who were refused entry upon arrival at the international airport during the year were not afforded their legal right to appeal their denial of admission.   In addition to accepting 20 to 25 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees, the Government admitted 72 Kosovar refugees into the country during the year.  Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment.  The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family.  The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs.  For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate in a special half-day Icelandic language course every day that is designed especially for them.  Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.   Section 3:     Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May.   Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation.  Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 23 of the 63 seats in Parliament.  The Women's List (WL), an activist feminist political party whose establishment in 1983 led to a significant increase in the number of female parliamentarians, joined an electoral alliance with other left-leaning parties in the May elections.  The WL plans to merge eventually with the other left-leaning political parties to form a single entity to challenge the more conservative parties.  Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.  Section 4:     Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5:     Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.  The law and practice generally reflect this attitude.  However, concern is voiced that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn.  Some 14,000 people of foreign origin now live in the country (approximately 2 percent of the population).  During the last half of the year, the Directorate of Immigration was issuing new residence and work permits at the rate of more than 200 per month.  Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expects most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.        Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern.  A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children.  Approximately 400 women and 150 children came to the shelter during the year, 100 of whom sought shelter while the rest asked for counseling or information.  At a rape trauma center, 400 women and children seek assistance annually.  Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors.  The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has a special staff to care for rape victims.  It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.   A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.    Many victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society.  With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society.  Concern that these women might be vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to begin offering them emergency accommodation and assistance, which includes information on legal rights, language training, and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms.  There were indications that some women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Section 6.f.).   In the labor market, the rate of participation by women is high.  In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home.  Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women.  A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men.  A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.        Children   The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care.  School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15.  About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the state.  The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care.  In 1994 the government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.     There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center.  The objective of the Center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews.  The Center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and counselors, as well as officials from the Child Protection Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs.  Prior to the establishment of the Center, barely half of the cases dealt with by the Child Protection Agency were sent to the police for investigation, just a third went to the prosecutor, and only 10 percent ever went to trial.  Now some 75 percent of cases are sent to the police for investigation, and the authorities anticipate a corresponding increase in the percentage of cases being prosecuted and sent to trial.        People with Disabilities   Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services.  A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others.""  The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are equally qualified, or more qualified, than regular applicants.  Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public buildings to be accessible.  However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that the provisions related to building access often are ignored because there is no penalty for noncompliance.  Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.   Section 6:     Worker Rights        a.     The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party.  Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.  No strikes occurred during the year, but there were a handful of work stoppages.        b.     The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded in law or practice.  Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether they are members of the union or not.  This is because union dues help support, among other things, an illness fund to which everyone is entitled.     The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions.  The current 3-year collective bargaining agreements expire in February 2000.  In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private-sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.     Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.   There are no export processing or other special economic zones.            c.     Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Section 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).  The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d.     Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).  The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This prohibition is observed in practice.  Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work.  Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.        e.     Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not.  Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.  Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.    Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met.  Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health.  Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.        f.     Trafficking in Persons   The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.      Trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the growing number of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs.  With the recent opening of several new striptease clubs (there are now 11 clubs altogether), the police expressed concern about the 500 women who entered the country during the year to work in these establishments.  It is suspected that some of the women--especially those from Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union--were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will.     Regulation of these clubs has been lacking, in part because striptease dancers can enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to a month under an exemption given for ""artists.""  The Government plans to close this legal loophole.    By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.

GX256-98-16288633	"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE 10 W. JACKSON BLVD. CHICAGO, IL 60604  NEWS RELEASE Thursday, August 29, 2002  Indonesian National Sentenced to 13 Months in Prison for Visa and Identity Fraud Chicago, IL - Brian R. Perryman, District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Chicago, together with Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, announced the sentencing today of an Indonesian national for document and visa fraud. Albigensis Sadat, age 24 and an illegal alien, was sentenced today by U.S District Judge David H. Coar to 13 months in prison. On October 2, 2001 an international package mailed from Indonesia to Sadat in Chicago was intercepted at the Fed Ex hub in Anchorage, Alaska. Although the package indicated it contained ""documents,"" it appeared suspicious. Upon opening the package, U.S. Customs Inspectors discovered counterfeit U.S. Immigration admission stamps, counterfeit Illinois Secretary of State stamps, and inkpads containing red and black security ink. INS and Customs worked together to deliver the package to Sadat's residence at 5009 S. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive in Chicago on October 5, 2001. Federal agents took Sadat into custody at that time and a search of his apartment yielded several counterfeit blank immigration documents, counterfeit blank Social Security cards, several completed counterfeit Illinois temporary drivers licenses, and $6,000 in cash. ""During this time of heightened national security, the INS is working hard to combat the proliferation of counterfeit documents being manufactured and sold on our streets,"" says INS District Director Brian R. Perryman. ""The issue of identity theft and fraud is of great concern to the INS here in Chicago and across the country."" Since 1998, INS agents in Chicago have confiscated more than 70,000 fraudulent documents from illegal document manufacturers and vendors. Sadat will be surrendered to the custody of INS upon completion of his sentence to be placed in deportation proceedings. ###"

Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. Even though open to engagement with Iran, the Bush Administration and many in Congress want to continue vigorous efforts to counter Iran's support for terrorist groups and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destructio n (WMD) programs. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern, although the Clinton Administration did not cite progress as a specific condition for an improvement in relations. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Iran's efforts to acquire WMD and delivery means, particularly its ballistic missile program, have made major st rides over the past few years, with the help of foreign suppliers. Barred from U.S. or European advanced technology, Iran continues to receive weaponry and WMD-related technology from China, Russia, and North Korea. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Islamic-oriented Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran apparently is also arming the Palestinian Authority. All Iranian factions have strongly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000. Current U.S. policy toward Iran marks an apparent shift from the almost exclusive focus on containment that characterized U.S. policy during 1980 - 1997. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). The sanctions were intended to deny Iran the material resources to threaten U.S. interests. In keeping with the 1997 policy shift t oward engagement, in 1999 and 2000 the Clinton Administration and Congress eased sanctions somewhat to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of luxury consumer goods, such as carpets. However, the United States continues to work with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. Legislation to renew ILSA for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  01-14-02  MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Legislation to renew the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another 5 years was passed by large majorities in both chambers and signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24). A long-time supporter of anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan, Iran has cooperated with U.S. efforts to defeat the Taliban and deliver humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. However, the thawing of U.S.-Iran relations evident over the past four years began to reverse in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and perceived Iranian efforts to exert influence on the new Afghan government.  BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi has expressed frustration that his reform program has been obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who use their control of key levers of power to prevent a loosening of domestic restrictions or moderation of foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 30 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors. The power struggle broke into the open in early August 2001, when hardliners succeeded in delaying Khatemi's second term inauguration until the Majlis approved several hardliners to the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Khatemi made few changes to his cabinet, and the Majlis approved all his choices.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. Bush Administration officials have also expressed concern about Iran's plans to reinvigorate a conventional buildup. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear set to rise again. Equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to temporarily block the Strait of Hormuz or disrupt international shipping, but Iran is considered to lack the capability to move significant numbers of troops across the Gulf. In November 2000, Russia   IB93033  CRS-2  01-14-02  told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). A provision of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, cuts U.S. aid to countries that sell lethal military equipment to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. See CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions, and CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) U.S. government proliferation reports, including an August 2001 CIA report covering July - December 2000, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. The foreign assistance continued despite U.S. anti-proliferation efforts through multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, and Australia Group. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Although two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), U.S. intelligence officials said publicly in August 2001 that Iran will soon ""field"" the Shahab-3. At least one defense publication said in mid-October 2001 that Iran had launched serial production of the Shahab-3. Iran is also developing a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, and it has publicly mentioned an even longer- range Shahab-5, although development of the Shahab-5 apparently has not begun, according to U.S. reports. A Washington Post report of January 11, 2002 quotes an intelligence estimate as saying that most, but not all, U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran will likely field an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015. The Washington Times reported on April 18, 2001, that North Korea was in the process of shipping missile components to Iran, and on June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. In the   IB93033  CRS-3  01-14-02  course of August 2001 talks with China on missile proliferation, Bush Administration officials appeared to cast doubt that China was upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. See also CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions. Nuclear Weapons. U.S. officials believe Iran is acquiring the expertise and technology that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. Russia, despite U.S. protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2002. In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build a second reactor at Bushehr. During his June 16, 2001 meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, President Bush raised U.S. concerns about an alleged transfer by a Russian firm to Iran of high-strength aluminum that the United States believes Iran might use to manufacture enriched uranium for a nuclear weapons program. A February 2001 CIA report to Congress, which covered the period of Khatemi's June 2000 visit to China, dropped language from previous reports that China has kept its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran is mulling accepting more stringent inspections. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106-429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism is considered an obstacle to improved U.S.-Iran relations. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2000, released April 30, 2001, states that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2000,"" although the report attributed that activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks, but an unprecedented visit by Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw on September 25, 2001 failed to enlist Iran openly in an anti-terrorism coalition. Press reports in November 2001 indicated Iran is considering withdrawing some of its Revolutionary Guard officers from countries, such as Sudan, Lebanon, and Bosnia, where they have been supporting Islamist movements  possibly indicating, if true, diminished Iranian interest in sponsoring some radical Islamic groups that have been involved in terrorism. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2001.)   IB93033  CRS-4  01-14-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. Saudi Arabia officials announced that the 11 Saudi suspects who are in custody in Saudi Arabia would be tried in Saudi courts and not turned over to U.S. justice. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but relations have improved dramatically over the past few years. In early 1998, the two began exchanging significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, alleviating a key source of friction. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran cooperates with Iraq's illicit export of oil products (worth about $50 million per month as of early 2001) through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally curtailed its cooperation with that exportation. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime. Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran as of March 2001.   IB93033  CRS-5  01-14-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. officials and U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Hamas and PIJ terrorist attacks escalated since the Palestinian uprising began in late September 2000, and Hamas conducted several major suicide attacks against Israeli civilians in 2001. Many in Congress have criticized Iran's incitement activities, such as its hosting of a conference for anti-peace process organizations on April 24, 2001. The conference served as a platform for Iranian statements against Israel that the United States called ""outrageous and intolerable."" Khamene'i told the meeting that Israelis had exaggerated the Holocaust to justify ""crimes"" against the Palestinians. Khamene'i said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final Israeli-Palestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has generally sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by joining them in a denunciation of Israeli-Palestinian interim agreements, and by pledging continued support to anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the dayto-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore a new development when it was revealed in early January that Iran was the source of a shipment of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority, in contravention of the PA's agreements with Israel. The arms could be used for terrorism or to bolster the PA's conventional combat capabilities. Many analysts say that the warming trend in U.S.-Iran relations over the past four years has been set back by the shipment revelations. About 100 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate arms deliveries to Hizballah, and the Los Angeles Times reported on May 6, 2001 that the United States, in late 2000, succeeded in persuading Turkey to prevent Iran from flying over Turkish airspace to Syria, thereby denying Iran an easy route for resupplying Hizballah. Even though the United Nations certified Israel's May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon as complete, Hizballah continues to battle Israel in the Shebaa Farms border area that Israel controls but which Hizballah claims constitutes Lebanese territory that is still occupied by Israel; Iran publicly supported Hizballah's ambush and capture of three Israeli soldiers and one alleged Israeli agent in October 2000, all in the Shebaa Farms area. (H.Res. 99 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, Syria, and Lebanon pressure Hizballah to allow visitations to the four captives by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The measure passed the House on June 25, 2001.) In late October 2001, Israel announced it believed the three captured soldiers had died. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002, said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. On May 10, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that the March 17, 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was the work of Hizballah. On September 2, 1999, Argentina issued an arrest warrant for senior Hizballah guerrilla leader Imad Mughniyah in   IB93033  CRS-6  01-14-02  connection with it. An Argentine judge has also accused Iran and Hizballah of a July 18, 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires; 20 alleged Argentine accomplices have been arrested and their trial began in late September 2001, but the main suspects are still at large. H.Res. 531 and S.Res. 329, calling on Argentina to step up the investigation of the 1994 bombing, were passed by their full chambers on July 17 and July 19, 2000, respectively. In May 2001, an FBI team traveled to Argentina to help with the AMIA investigation. Sudan/Egypt/Algeria. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's earlier alliance with Iran has frayed as Sudan has sought to achieve removal from the terrorism list. Khatemi said in October 1999 that he wants full normalization with Egypt, but Egypt demands, as a precondition, that Iran rename a Tehran street named for Sadat's assassin (Khalid Islambouli). Iran and Algeria restored relations on September 8, 2000; they were broken in 1992 by Algeria, which accused Iran of aiding Islamic opponents of the secular regime.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. Iran does not appear to be supporting radical Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Central Asian countries (with the possible exception of Tajikistan) or in Russia's Dagestan and Chechnya regions, but Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly allows anti-Uzbekistan activists access to Iran's state radio. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran has pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States, and is allowing U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials have called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive"" In late November, Iran reopened its embassy in Kabul.   IB93033  CRS-7  01-14-02  Iran's public stance, and some of its activities, have reflected official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. Amid press reports in January 2002 that Iran might be harboring some Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan, President Bush warned Iran against such activity. He also warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners in Iran. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001,   IB93033  CRS-8  01-14-02  Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but the rift appears to be starting to close somewhat. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington through the Embassy of Pakistan, staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. The Bush Administration appears to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts to end the long U.S.-Iran estrangement, and it has been looking for ways to build on the tacit cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. However, Iran continued to refuse to engage in official, bilateral talks until at least some U.S. sanctions are lifted. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for re-establishing relations with the United   IB93033  CRS-9  01-14-02  States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's representative to the United Nations. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed in January 2002. Revelations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become far more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. However, these revelations have, to date, led few experts to argue that Iran is likely to become a target of the U.S. war on terrorism.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism List. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. For information on U.S. sanctions on foreign suppliers of arms and technology, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. In late January 1999, Iran allowed the UNDCP to open an office in Tehran. Press reports indicate that Britain has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran.   IB93033  CRS-10  01-14-02  Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a caseby-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not indicated whether it will do so. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar. Regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian carpets are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was scheduled to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). For further discussion of ILSA and its renewal, see CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and support for the project among oil companies and regional governments has gained momentum over the past few months. A detailed engineering study is under way. However, in a potential setback to Baku-Ceyhan, it was reported in late May 2001 that Kazakhstan will ask Totalfina Elf to study construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged visiting Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy to allow oil routes through Iran; Powell reiterated U.S. policy but did not reject the request outright. Russia, which seeks to route oil and gas lines through it, reportedly also favors a route from Kazakhstan through Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.)   IB93033  CRS-11  01-14-02  European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998, about eight months after Khatemi took office. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to $7.8 billion as of April 2001, according to Iran's Central Bank. Iran plans to retire about half of that remaining debt by   IB93033  CRS-12  01-14-02  March 2002. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In October 1999, Dutch banks extended $2 billion in credits to investors in Iran. In July 2000, Germany increased its export insurance cover from $100 million to $500 million in conjunction with Khatemi's visit there. In July 2001, France's Societe Generale de France extended a $1 billion credit line to a group of Iranian commercial banks. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. Multilateral Lending to Iran/WTO. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform strategy for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the actual loans is expected in the spring of 2002. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective   IB93033  CRS-13  01-14-02  Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon: David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In mid-October 2001, the Bush Administration asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit against Iran by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets -- diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988. Related Issues. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997).   IB93033  CRS-14  01-14-02  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. On October 8, 1999, the PMOI's umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR), was designated an alias of the PMOI, subjecting it to the same restrictions as apply to the PMOI (no visits by its members to the United States, seizure of its U.S. assets, and a ban on U.S. resident contributions to the group). The State Department's annual terrorism review, issued in April 2000, cited several PMOI attacks on Iran as justifying Iran's claim that Iran is a victim of terrorism. Many in Congress appear to differ with the Administration view of the group and majorities in Congress have occasionally signed letters asking the Secretary of State to explore the possibility of working with the PMOI against Iran. On October 11, 2000, a letter signed by 225 House Members and 28 Senators was released, calling for support for the NCR and deploring Iran's human rights record. Among its recent activities in Iran, the PMOI claimed responsibility for assassinating a senior Iranian military officer in Tehran in April 2000. The United States condemned the killing. The PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on the presidential palace on February 6, 2000; Khatemi was not hurt. On March 13, 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for launching a mortar attack in Tehran, although it missed its target and hit an apartment complex. In August 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on an army base in Tehran, and the group's supporters in Iran have been putting up posters of the group's leaders, Masud and Maryam Rajavi. On January 21, 2001, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a court in Tehran, and, on February 20, 2001, its Iraqbased military arm made a brief incursion into Iran, clashing with local security forces. Iran's   IB93033  CRS-15  01-14-02  agents and military forces frequently retaliate against the group's personnel and facilities in Iraq. Seven alleged members were arrested in Los Angeles in March 2001 for allegedly raising money for the organization, and subsequently were indicted. (See CRS Report 97-961, Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran.) Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts."
GX005-39-0432272	FROM THE OFFICE OF           PUBLIC AFFAIRS              September 16, 2003 JS-734 Financial Reconstruction in Iraq:  Strategy and Tactics John B. Taylor Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance   Chairman Hagel, Ranking Member Bayh, other members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on the financial reconstruction of Iraq.  Given the importance of trade and finance for Iraqs reconstruction, this Subcommittee is an ideal forum for this discussion.  And the presence of my colleagues, Under Secretary Larson and Chairman Merrill, further underscores the importance of active government-wide participation in the reconstruction effort.      When I last testified on this subject, on June 4 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I stressed that the international community and the Iraqi people face an enormous task in the reconstruction of the Iraqi economy.  A quarter century of repression and economic mismanagement under Saddam Hussein cut the size of the economy to only a small fraction of what it was before his regime took over.  In 1979 GDP in Iraq was $128 billion...by 2001 it had declined to $40 billion.  I also stressed the strategy of financial reconstructionthe contingency plans developed in advance of the military conflictand the tactics followed on the ground since the conflict began.  I would like to stress these same issues in my testimony today, with emphasis on the additional information we have obtained on the state of the Iraqi economy and on what has happened on the ground during the summer months.     Much has been accomplished in the financial area since the fall of Saddam Husseins repressive regime, and many potential financial catastrophes have been avoided. In my view, months of advance planning by the United States government before Saddams fall as well as the dedicated work of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi people since Saddams fall are responsible for these accomplishments.     Starting late last year, we began developing a strategy for financial reconstruction based on the information we had at the time.  The strategy addressed such issues as (1) payments to Iraqi workers and pensioners, (2) the currency, (3) the banking system, (4) Iraqs international debt, (5) an assessment of reconstruction costs, and (6) the international fundraising efforts.  I want to review how that strategy is playing out today.  But before doing so I must emphasize that an important part of our advance planning has been the selection of people to participate in the financial reconstruction effort.  We began selecting financial experts in January; the first wave of people was deployed to Kuwait in March and to Baghdad in April. Early on we decided that a financial coordinator was essential and we are very grateful to Peter McPherson who took leave from the Presidency of Michigan State University and has served most ably in this position, advising Ambassador Bremer and the rest of the Coalition Provisional Authority.     A Strategy for Paying Workers and Pensioners   It was clear that we had to have a strategy for paying Iraqi workers and pensioners after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and thus we crafted a strategy well in advance of his fall.  Keeping workers on the payroll with stable purchasing power would be essential to prevent severe hardship and economic collapse. But how many workers were there and how much should they be paid?  What currency should be used to make the payments?  Where would the funds come from?  Would the payments system be in good enough condition after the conflict to actually make payments?  How could we prevent hyperinflation and a sharp depreciation of the currency, which would further impoverish people?  After all, one of the reasons for the terrible economic performance under Saddam was that he resorted to the printing press to finance his spending, causing high inflation and a drop in the dinar to about 1/5000th of its former value.     Starting late last year we developed such a payments strategy, which was approved interagency after much valuable discussion and debate about alternative strategies. The strategy called for paying workers and pensioners in U.S. dollars on an interim basis.  This was not dollarizing the economy, because the strategy called for the continued use of local currenciessuch as the Saddam dinar in the center and south and the Swiss dinar in the northand their eventual replacement by a new national currency, as described below.  Using U.S. dollars on an interim basis would create stability and would help prevent a collapse of the dinar.     Finding a way to secure the funds to make these payments in advance of the conflict proved to be a challenge.  After much discussion and debate, we decided that the best approach was to use Iraqi regime assets that were frozen at U.S. commercial banks back in 1990 at the time of the first Gulf War.  In order to use the assets for this purpose, they had to be vested for the use of the Iraqi people.  Our estimates were that there was about $1.7 billion that could be vested in the United States and that this amount would probably be sufficient to last until a new currency could be issued in Iraq.  A vesting strategy was worked out and approved by interagency legal experts.  Under this plan the President would call for the vesting of the assets in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York near the time that the military conflict began.   To make such a strategy operational, many tactical issues and contingencies had to be considered.  For example, the plan called for the military on the ground to issue public statementsworked out with the Departments of Defense and Treasurythat the dinar would continue to be accepted as a means of payment after the fall of the Saddam regime. The plan also called for the first wave of financial advisers into Baghdad to assess the payments systems capability for making dollar payments.    Another essential operational issue concerned the actual shipping of the currency to Iraq, and a plan for making the payments to workers and pensioners on the ground had to be developed.  We estimated that enough currency in the right denominations was in storage in the New York Feds warehouse in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and we determined that it was feasible to ship the currency by tractor trailer to Andrews Air Force Base, load it on military aircraft, and fly it to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait for the last leg into Iraq. Many tons of currency were involved because of the need for small denominations:  one-dollar or five-dollar bills.  On the ground, the military would assist in the actual shipment of the currency around the country. Financial experts would develop lists of eligible workers and pensioners who would be paid. The currency would be distributed to Iraqis who would then actually make the payments.  In some cases, the currency would be paid at the state owned enterprises or government ministries.  In other cases, pensioners would come to local banks to receive payments.     I am pleased to say that this strategy along with all its tactical details has been carried out with great success.  On March 20, at the start of the conflict, President Bush issued an order calling for the vesting of the frozen assets.  As a result, approximately $1.7 billion was vested in the New York Fed.  With these funds at the New York Fed, the first shipment of currency from the Feds East Rutherford, New Jersey warehouse to Camp Arifjan was made on April 13.  Even as major combat operations were winding down, a mechanism for shipment of cash and distribution of emergency payments was established and began to function.  Thanks to this system, we were able to make monthly emergency payments to dock workers, rail workers, power plant workers, and others essential to restoring basic services.  We soon transitioned to regular civil service salary and pension payments to over 2 million Iraqis.     Despite tremendous logistical challenges, the system of payments has worked well.  Our financial experts in Baghdad consider this to be a major force for stability in the country, as well as a significant spur to economic growth.  As of this date all but $64 million of the vested assets has been shipped to Iraq where they have been used principally to support salary and pension payments to the Iraqi people.  The Department of Defenses logistical support has been crucial in this enormous undertaking.     Throughout this period there has been no collapse of the currency, no hyperinflation, and no serious glitch in the payments process itself.  In sum, this major and essential success in the reconstruction was due in large part to pre-conflict planning and to adjustments that were made as we implemented the plan and learned from experience.                                                                                                                                                                A New Unified Currency for Iraq    As I indicated, the payments strategy called for the use of U.S. dollars on an interim basis only.  Our goal was for the Iraqi people to choose a new national currency to replace the Saddam dinar and the Swiss dinar, and to provide the necessary financial and logistical assistance to do so.  A stable unified currency is an essential part of a market economy and therefore one of the key parts of financial reconstruction.       I am happy to say that this part of the financial reconstruction strategy is on track as well.  Last July 7, after consulting with representatives from the Central Bank, the finance ministry, and other interested Iraqis in the north and the south, the Coalition Provisional Authority announced that a new currency would be issued starting in October.  The new currency would replace the old currencies at fixed rates that were also announced.   Hence, the Coalition Provisional Authority and Iraqi officials in the Central Bank and the finance ministry are about to begin one of the most important parts of the financial reconstruction to date:  issuing a new currency to replace the Iraqi currencies that are now circulating.  The new currency is a key component in the effort to establish a stable financial system.     The new currency bears the designs of the old Iraqi, or Swiss, dinar and is being produced at printing facilities around the world on schedule.  There will be six denominations to replace the current two denominations.  About 2200 tons of currency will be shipped from printing facilities in England, Spain, and other countries.  A sufficient supply of new notes will be available when they are introduced.     The exchange period will begin on October 15 and last until January 15.  A public education campaign is underway in Iraq to ensure that the Iraqi people are well informed about the new currency and are prepared for the currency exchange.  The new currency will improve the ease of transactions, since it will be issued in more denominations than are currently available, and will have built-in security features that will enhance public confidence by making the notes more difficult to counterfeit.     Restoring and Revitalizing the Banking Sector   We knew well before hostilities began that strengthening and modernizing Iraqs financial sector would be central to achieving overall economic reconstruction, and that a thorough on-the-ground assessment of Iraqs financial sector would be needed as soon as conditions allowed.  Thanks to extensive pre-war planning, Treasury was able to position advisors in Iraqs finance ministry, Central Bank and two main commercial banks even as hostilities were winding down.     The challenges they faced to perform seemingly simple tasks, such as schedule a meeting with Iraqi bankers, were enormous due to security concerns, the lack of working phones or faxes, and language barriers.  Despite these difficulties, I am pleased to report some major successes.     One of the most important is the reopening of most of the branches of Iraqs two large state-owned banks  Rafidain and Rasheed  which enabled cash-strapped Iraqi families to gain access to their savings.   Opening these branches was no small feat.   Many of the banks branches were damaged and we were fearful of a bank run once the banks reopened.  Due to careful planning, individual Iraqis now have access to their deposits and there were no bank runs.    The initial assessments conducted by our advisors have provided much insight into the operations of Rafidain and Rasheed banks.  As our pre-planning analyses indicated, these banks did not function independently of the former regime.  We now know that these banks were not permitted to make loans based on commercial viability and a borrowers ability to repay, but instead on the ability of the borrower to fulfill a Baathist party political objective.  The Coalition Provisional Authority, with the support of Treasury, is hard at work reviewing ideas for restructuring the two major state-owned banks.       Analyses of Iraqs private banks are almost complete.  While these banks are small in relation to the two large state-owned banks, they will play a role in Iraqs future.  We know that remittances through these banks are starting to occur.  Remittances by Iraqis overseas will soon form a large pool of resources in Iraq that will finance investment and consumption.  According to some estimates, about 4 million Iraqis live abroad, and in recent years they have transferred over $1 billion per year to relatives in Iraq.   In addition to strengthening specific banks, the financial system more broadly  including the relevant laws and regulations  will require significant work to ensure that an efficient and effective system for financial intermediation is achieved.  In consultation with the International Monetary Fund, we are working with the Iraqi Governing Council, other Iraqi officials, and the Iraq Bankers Association on a revision of Iraqs Central Bank law and commercial banking law.  Creating a sound supervisory and regulatory regime is also critical to establishing a strong financial system.   We have reached out to countries in the region, including Jordan, Bahrain, and the UAE, who have offered to provide technical training to Central Bank and commercial bank employees.     As work proceeds on these broad objectives, some initial bank lending has started, with the focus on loans directed towards Iraqi small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Additionally, the Treasury has approached the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, about setting up a facility in Iraq to provide loans to micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses.  This would be a multilateral facility modeled after other highly successful programs in Russia, Central Asia and Southeast Europe.     One major initiative that is now getting off the ground is the creation of the Trade Bank of Iraq.  This Iraqi-staffed institution will facilitate imports to and exports from Iraq by putting in place the people and systems needed for the country to trade more efficiently and on a larger scale with the rest of the world.  Currently, trade is taking place at the retail level.  In Baghdads markets one can find consumer goods  from refrigerators to satellite disks  imported from neighboring countries.  But in order for Iraqs reconstruction to move forward as quickly as possible, and for private sector activity to take off, there needs to be an efficient system for importing a broad range of capital goods and services.  Our goal is for Iraqi banks to provide trade finance services.  But as the process of strengthening Iraqi banks goes forward, there is an immediate need to do this.  The Trade Bank of Iraq is intended to fill that gap.   Following a competitive bidding process, the CPA is negotiating a contract with a consortium of international banks which will facilitate the operations of the Trade Bank.  Additionally, the Trade Bank will be the entity by which Export Credit Agencies around the world support trade with Iraq.  There is precedent in creating institutions such as the Trade Bank in post-war Japan and Germany.  Those institutions evolved and took on functions akin to export-import banks, although how the Trade Bank evolves will be up to the Iraqi people.       Iraqs International Debt   Early on we recognized that dealing with Iraqs substantial foreign debt problem would be crucial to the countrys medium-term economic health.  We therefore developed a strategy to resolve this problem.     First, using the financial information we had, we ensured that Iraq would not have to service its debt following the end of the war and during the critical reconstruction phase.  Demands for repayment would have greatly reduced the resources available to a new Iraqi government.  Therefore, we secured recognition from the G7 that Iraq would not service its external debt at least through the end of 2004.  Subsequently, the Paris Club group of official creditors stated their expectation that Iraq would not make payments over this time period.   Next we sought to obtain the best possible data on Iraqs foreign debt and its economic condition.  Without any reliable data, it would be difficult to reach an international consensus on a debt strategy.  We began collecting data by sending several technical assistance advisors to Iraq to review the governments debt records once the war ended.  At the same time, we worked intensively through the Paris Club and the International Monetary Fund to obtain data from creditors.     We have made significant progress.  The latest available information indicates that Iraqs external debt amounts to at least $70 billion and is probably closer to $100 to $120 billion.  Paris Club members report that they are owed roughly $40 billion -- $21 billion in principal and roughly an equivalent amount in late interest.  The IMF has polled non-Paris Club governments and, as of September 10, reports creditor claims of $28 billion in principal and interest.  Since 20 governments have yet to respond to the IMF poll, this figure is likely to increase.      With better data in hand, we can now proceed with our strategy and work out a long-term solution to Iraqs debt problem.  We will continue to work with other creditors toward the objective of achieving a substantial restructuring of Iraqs debt that will permit the Iraqi government to channel resources into reconstruction activities.   Assessment of Reconstruction Costs and International Fundraising Efforts   We also knew at the outset that one of the major priorities following the conflict would be to produce a comprehensive assessment of reconstruction costs in Iraq.   We recognized that we could not focus solely on the costs of repairing the damage inflicted during the short conflict.  Saddam Husseins total disregard for the welfare of his population likely meant that the needs of the Iraqi people  and the cost of reversing decades of economic decline  would be substantial.     Because of the extent of Iraqs isolation from the international community, we had little reliable information regarding the extent to which critical investments had been neglected.  We were concerned that the absence of economic data and other information would make the job of producing a timely needs assessment especially challenging.  We engaged early with our fellow shareholders and with senior officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to create a process for making a needs assessment as soon as the environment was permissible.  As a result of these discussions, these institutions acted quickly to develop the scope of the assessment, divide up responsibility for different sectors, and recruit the necessary staff.       We expect that the cost for reconstruction will be in the range of $50 to $75 billion.  This estimate covers critical infrastructure needs in electricity, public works, transport, telecommunications, health, education and agricultural sectors, among others.  But it excludes the annual expenses that have been identified by the Coalition Provisional Authority to cover the government operating budget.      Clearly, this is a cost that will need to be shared widely, and underscores the importance of a major donor effort for Iraq.  In June, we established a Core Group of donors, consisting of Japan, the EC and the United Arab Emirates, to consult regularly with the UN, World Bank, IMF and CPA, on the planning and preparation for the donor conference.  The members of this group are engaging intensively with other potential donors to urge them to pledge generously at the donor meeting in Madrid on October 24.   We believe our own substantial contribution of $20 billion  as reflected in the Presidents forthcoming supplemental request  will be critical to leveraging support from other governments.    In addition, we are encouraging the international financial institutions to commit their own resources to the people of Iraq.  As you are aware, the IMF and World Bank recalled their staff following the bombing of UN headquarters where they were also housed.  However, these institutions remain actively engaged on Iraq, and are continuing to work with CPA and Iraqi officials, providing technical assistance and finalizing the needs assessment.  The World Bank  in conjunction with the UN  is also completing the design of a multi-donor trust fund that would pool bilateral donations and make them available for priority needs identified by these agencies in their needs assessments.  In addition to these vital contributions, we have made good progress in our discussions with the IMF and the World Bank on identifying the type and amounts of resources that could be made available to the Iraqi people once the conditions for lending are in place.   In a related exercise, we are reaching out to Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) around the world, encouraging them to follow the U.S. Ex-Im Banks efforts to support investments in Iraq by insuring repayments.  Many other governments have responded positively to this effort, including Japan and the United Kingdom.  Through credit facilities such as the one proposed by Ex-Im Bank, credit agencies will be able to provide short-term export credits worth several billion dollars.  Initiatives like this will be very important for supporting trade, facilitating commercial activity and spurring growth in Iraq.     Countries other than the U.S. have been identifying and freezing assets of the Hussein regime in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1483.  Over $1 billion of such assets has been identified and frozen.  We are working hard to encourage countries that have frozen assets to transfer those funds to the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), where they will assist in the reconstruction of the country.  We have already had some success in these efforts, including a transfer of approximately $98 million to the DFI announced by Japan on August 29.      Conclusion   Achieving a stable and productive economy is central to our goal of a unified and prosperous Iraq.  We have made considerable progress on financial reconstruction over the last several months, thanks to extensive advance planning and the work of many dedicated professionals from the U.S., Coalition partners, and Iraq.  Our activities will only intensify in the coming months.  While the challenges are formidable, we are well on the way to establishing a vibrant economy that creates opportunities for all Iraqis to achieve a better future for themselves and their children.
