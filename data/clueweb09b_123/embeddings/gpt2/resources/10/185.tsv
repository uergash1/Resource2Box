GX245-54-0912104	"Women Legislators of Maryland   A Caucus of the Maryland General Assembly            Marsha C. Wise,  Executive Director   Caucus homepage   In 1995, the women of Maryland and all over the United States celebrated the 100th anniversay of the first election of women to a state legislature. In 1894, three women were elected to served in the Colorado House of Representatives and they were sworn in in January 1895. The next year, the first woman in a state senate was elected to the Utah Senate.  Maryland's first woman legislator,  Mary Eliza Watters Risteau , was elected in 1921 from Harford County and took office in 1922. She served for four sessions, 1922, 1924, 1931, and 1933. In 1934, she became the first woman elected to the Maryland Senate and served in the 1935 and 1937 sessions. In 1950, she was again elected to the House of Delegates and served in the 1951 session.  In 1958,  Verda F. Welcome  and  Irma George Dixon  became the first African American women to be elected to the House of Delegates, and, in 1962, Verda Welcome became the first African American woman to be elected to the Maryland Senate.   In February 1972, Senator  Rosalie Abrams  introduced a resolution that the women in the Maryland General Assembly form a Women's Caucus that would meet regularly to ""push for the recognition of women and their abilities."" Acting on that resolution, eight women delegates and three women senators created the Women Legislators of Maryland, a group that has grown in membership, resources, and political strength. The overall mission of the group is to improve public policy that affects women's lives and to increase the number of women elected and appointed to public service in Maryland. On February 21, 1997, the Women Legislators of Maryland marked the 25th anniversary of this caucus which has grown from an ""informal support group"" with no staff or resources to a professionally managed, fiscally strong organization. This anniversary was officially celebrated with a Joint Session of the Legislature on March 7, 1997.   There are now 55 women serving in the Maryland General Assembly and a total of 153 women have served since 1922. Women have held and continue to hold positions of power and leadership in the General Assembly, and the Executive and Judicial branches of Maryland government. Women have, indeed, claimed their voice in Maryland.       Presidents  of the Women's Caucus, 1974-1999       History  of the Women's Caucus      Women Who Served  in the Maryland General Assembly, 1922 - 1999      Executive Directors  of the Women's Caucus, 1976 - 1999       Remarks  of the State Archivist at the Joint Session of the Maryland General Assembly marking the 25th Anniversary of the Women's Caucus,  March 7, 1997                             [  Archives' Home Page  ||  Visitors' Center  ||  Search the Archives  ||  Staff Directory  ||  Maryland & Its Government  ||  Maryland Manual On-Line  ||  Reference & Research  ||  Education & Outreach  ||  Government House  ||  State Art Collection  ||  Archives of Maryland  ]  Governor      General Assembly     Judiciary      Maryland Electronic Capital         © Copyright February 28, 2001Maryland State Archives"

Over a 24 hour period, Governor Warner will make six economic                  development announcements across Southside and Southwest Virginia,                  totaling 1208 new jobs, 180 saved jobs, and more than $50 million                  in private investment. Including today's announcements, Governor                  Warner has announced more than 3,750 new jobs and nearly $290                  million in investment in Southside and Southwest since taking                  office in January. Statewide, Governor Warner has announced more                  than 22,000 new jobs and $2.32 billion in investment.

""It's clear that we made the right decision last year when                  we chose to locate Sherwood's new plant in Southside, Virginia,""                  said Mr. Uziel Frydman, President and Chief Executive Officer                  of Sherwood Brands. ""Our state-of-the-art facility has only                  been operating for a few months, yet we already are moving aggressively                  to expand significantly. Obviously, we are delighted with every                  aspect of doing business in Chase City. We've found top-quality                  workers, excellent transportation, and a business-friendly environment.                  We look forward to continuing to grow together with this wonderful                  community.""                  Governor Warner approved a $125,000 grant from the Governor's                  Opportunity Fund to assist Mecklenburg County with the project.

SPECIAL INTERESTS: Parenting, baking, scrabble, backgammon, guitar; and exercising my civic duties to better our state.  STATEMENT: A former Anchorage Mayor paid me an outstanding compliment. ""Andre, every morning when I met with my staff to review policy and proposals, I'd ask.....what can McLeod find wrong with this policy?"" An editorial writer describes me as a person who thoroughly does her homework when working on issues. One assembly member continually tells me about my persistent efforts to take things to the nth degree without letting up. After years of attending public hearings, assembly and school board meetings, consistently challenging others to address injustices, and reform and rethink failings of the system, I'm running to represent the people of District 24. We need to elect legislators with enough nerve, good sense and integrity to critically oversee special interests in a civil and constructive manner. Anchorage must elect legislators who owe their allegiance to the general public and not merely a few select contributors. I've taken on special interests at the Anchorage Municipal level and was the prime force behind the citizens' movement to adopt a Municipal Lobbying Ordinance. The state law to protect family privacy rights against prying public health officials and the social work bureaucracy was strengthened because of my steady pressure and constant advocacy before legislators. We need special interests in Alaska to promote and maintain our handsome quality of life. But we also need legislators who can say no when they reach too deep into the public pocket and home. My opponents are for special interests down the line. My only special interest is you.

""Our state-of-the-art facility has only                  been operating for a few months, yet we already are moving aggressively                  to expand significantly. Obviously, we are delighted with every                  aspect of doing business in Chase City. We've found top-quality                  workers, excellent transportation, and a business-friendly environment.                  We look forward to continuing to grow together with this wonderful                  community.""

The finalists were selected from among a group of 53 state small business persons of the year representing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.     ""The 53 small business owners who are selected to represent their states at National Small Business Week run the gamut from candy-making to lumber, from amusement parks to fitness clubs,"" said Acting SBA Administrator John Whitmore.  ""They are a mosaic of American entrepreneurship.       ""It’s a privilege to welcome these entrepreneurs to Small Business Week here in Washington, and a special honor to be able to choose the national winner from among them.""

Winners are: Richard Hodges of New Bern for outstanding personal achievement;    the Rev. and Mrs. Oliver Robinson of Elizabeth City, outstanding volunteer award;    St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church of Blowing Rock, outstanding congregation    award; Hospitality House of Asheville, outstanding community impact; and Cisco    Systems of Research Triangle Park, outstanding corporate award.    ""These folks truly embody what helping the homeless is all about,"" said    Kevin FitzGerald, director of the NC Division of Social Services. ""We are honored    to be able to recognize them for all the good things that they do to benefit    so many people.""    The awards were given by the North Carolina Interagency Council for Coordinating    Homeless Programs, which hosted about 400 people at the council's annual conference,    held at the Jane S. McKimmon Center Tuesday and today.    Homelessness touches people in every county in North Carolina. It is a community    problem magnified this year by the devastation that flooding from Hurricane    Floyd brought to thousands of homes and families in eastern parts of the state    in September.    In 54 counties where 121 agencies received emergency shelter grants through    the N.C. Office of Economic Opportunity, more than 43,000 people, including    6,289 families, were served in the year ending last June 30. Causes of homelessness    include domestic violence, sexual abuse, unemployment, drug abuse, alcoholism,    eviction, mental illness, natural disasters, underemployment and runaway children.     Those honored are:        Outstanding personal achievement - Richard Hodges, New Bern. After years      of fighting alcoholism and being homeless, Hodges sought help from Religious      Community Services of New Bern. While a resident of the RCS shelter, Hodges      attacked his alcoholism head-on through shelter support sessions and weekly      Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He now lives in permanent housing and drives      the organization's van providing transportation to shelter residents to jobs,      appointments, and he picks up food for the shelter. He provides moral support      and serves as a mentor to many of the shelter residents.       Outstanding Volunteer Award - Rev. Oliver Robinson and Jessie Robinson,      Elizabeth City. The Rev. and Mrs. Robinson saw the need for a shelter and      services for homeless people in Elizabeth City, and committed themselves to      seek and provide the help needed. Through their own resources and those of      a few others, they founded the Tabernacle of Faith Outreach Center, which      operates the area's only shelter for homeless women and children, and a soup      kitchen which feeds anyone in need. The center has thrived despite being started      in one of the city's most drug-infested communities. The shelter helped transform      the street on which it is located to a safe, clean drug-free place to live.      The Rev. and Mrs. Robinson are familiar to the elected officials and service      agency staff of Elizabeth City and Pasquotank County for their advocacy for      increased funding and services for the homeless. No job is too small, no need      too great to escape their attention and concern.      Outstanding Congregation Award - St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church      of Blowing Rock. St. Mary's of the Hills Episcopal Church of Blowing Rock      has a long history of service to the homeless of Watauga County. The congregation      has supported the Hospitality House of Boone since the shelter opened in1985.      The support of St. Mary's has been a primary factor in the success of programs      operated by Hospitality House of Boone. A share of St. Mary's annual fundraiser      is allocated to the House. Church volunteers prepare and serve meals for the      House's Bread of Life program which provides evening meals to the homeless      and hungry of Watauga County. Recently, the congregation initiated a project      to help the residents of Hospitality House establish their own homes. The      program provides residents with ""start-up boxes"" filled with essential food      and housekeeping items. The congregation secured one grant to fund this program      and is seeking additional support for the program from other area organizations      and businesses.      Outstanding Community Impact - Hospitality House of Asheville. Since 1986      Hospitality House of Asheville has provided shelter, food, employment, health      care and hope to thousands of homeless people. Hospitality House is an organization      of four programs representing a continuum of care for the homeless in Asheville      and Buncombe County. The philosophy of the organization incorporates compassion,      empowerment and community as a holistic approach to addressing the problems      of homelessness and poverty. Five homeless or formerly homeless people are      employed as staff members of the organization and at least two serve on the      organization's board. The newest program, AHOPE Day Center and Safe Haven,      provides assistance to the most hard-core of the homeless - those who have      been banned from other area shelters and service providers. Such people tend      to be socially isolated and ostracized and have limited access to any type      of subsistence aid. Since the inception of the Day Center and the assertive      street outreach of its staff, there have been no deaths among the homeless      from exposure in Buncombe County.       Outstanding Corporate Award - Cisco Systems Inc., Research Triangle Park.      In a time when large corporations are often accused of having no social conscience      or heart, Cisco Systems has demonstrated a spirit of caring for the hungry      and homeless that is remarkable. One year after beginning operation in San      Jose, Calif., Cisco Systems established a foundation and targeted the basic      needs of food and shelter as specific funding areas. Among the stated goals      of the foundation is support for the basic needs of individuals in extreme      hardship. Cisco Systems also encourages its employees to be active in community      service and matches in cash the volunteer time given by its employees to organizations      serving the poor and homeless. Since opening an operations center in the RTP,      Cisco Systems has continued its philanthropy. Beneficiaries of Cisco's contributions      of funding and employee volunteer time include The Women's Center of Wake      County, the Raleigh Rescue Mission, the Food Bank of North Carolina, Urban      Ministries of Raleigh and the Wake AIDS Service Agency. More than 3,000 poor      and homeless individuals and families have received assistance as a result      of the generous contributions of funding and volunteer time of Cisco Systems      and its employees.                             # # #                                        Public Affairs Office 101 Blair Drive, Raleigh, NC 27603 (919)733-9190 FAX (919)733-7447                   Debbie Crane Director"

TCB Brief: I Need Your Help - Following up                    on the Arts                      More on Richard Florida and what you think - an online survey.                                         Quote of the Week                                                           Dear Business Leader,                    As most of you know best, our nation's economy is a creative                    economy. Growth comes from innovation, discovering new ways                    of doing things, and valuing the promise of new ideas. Last                    week, I was reminded of this notion at our 2nd Annual Arts and                    Culture Town Meeting. We invited a professor of economic development                    at Carnegie Mellon University, Richard Florida, to discuss a                    topic critical to the future of Baltimore and all cities - one                    that doesn't get talked about enough - the harnessing power                    of creativity to endow a city.                    Second to safety and cleanliness, people want to live in a                    city that is vibrant, stimulating, and energetic. A city that                    has an art scene, or a music scene, an overall atmosphere for                    creativity - no matter what the muse might be.                    At the town meeting, we talked about things many of us already                    know. Baltimore has an extraordinary quantity and quality of                    arts and cultural assets and activities that set us apart. First                    and foremost, we have human capital - creative people, in every                    neighborhood in our city. From the the publishers of RADAR to                    self-starting arts programs like Black Cherry Puppet Theater,                    Fluid Movement or Kids on the Hill that stimulate creativity                    and nurture performance throughout city neighborhoods. We have                    institutions like the Walters, the Visionary Art Museum, BMA,                    the BSO, Peabody Institute, the Patterson Center for the Arts,                    the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of African American History and                    Culture and MICA, and many neighborhood institutions that are                    a source of tremendous pride for our city. And we have a government                    that is not stuck in the old paradigms of economic development                    but rather shares a common ethos with artists - one that values                    innovative ideas and creativity.                    We talked about the important activity that is already underway                    in our city - the development of the Station North Arts &                    Entertainment District and the newly designated Highlandtown                    Arts & Entertainment District; our success in doubling our                    Artist-in-Residence Program, bringing more art educators to                    our schools; our community grants that are supporting local                    arts organizations; and our murals program that every year begins                    and completes numerous projects that become ongoing sources                    of community pride and energy.                    There is so much underway in our city, but so much more to                    do. Arts and Culture is not an issue or subject that Government                    itself can drive. We are going to be looking for ways to partner                    with Baltimore's great art institutions and business community                    to make our resources go as far as they can.                    Some simple ways the business community can begin to help is                    to make networking opportunities available between entrepreneurs                    and the artistic and cultural communities of Baltimore. Or by                    taking a much closer look at Baltimore's assets, particularly                    in neighborhoods where arts and culture-related growth has taken                    root. It is critical that we do a better job of understanding                    how, when, where and why cultural economic development occurs                    - and how we can help lay the groundwork and cultivate a climate                    for even more arts-based economic development and prosperity                    in the future.                                      CitiStat: Managing Evictions                    Last year landlords made over 150,000 complaints about tenants                    not paying their rent on time, leading to over 7,000 evictions.                    From the associated court processes and the delivery of tenant                    notifications, to the clean up of eviction debris and attempts                    to mitigate the human impacts of evictions, multiple agencies                    of government have stakes in this issue.                    CitiStat has been examining the issue of eviction from a human                    service perspective during our meetings with the Office of Homeless                    Services (OHS) and from an operational perspective during our                    Solid Waste sessions. CitiStat's discussions are being fueled                    in part by a report on evictions from The Abell Foundation (http://www.abell.org/pubsitems/arn303.pdf).                    For context, consider that a survey conducted through OHS earlier                    this year found that over 25 percent of homeless people identified                    eviction as a reason for their homelessness-a cause mentioned                    only slightly less often than drug or alcohol abuse. Additionally,                    the clean up, removal, and storage of eviction debris annually                    costs the City's Department of Public Works in excess of $1                    million.                                                        The human consequences and financial costs of evictions are                    obviously enormous. Through CitiStat, we are working to try                    and develop strategies that not only promote the timely payment                    of rents, but also safeguard the rights of tenants and minimize                    the many ancillary effects of evictions.

TCB Brief: I Need Your Help - Following                    up on the Arts                    As mentioned earlier, I had the opportunity last week to hear                    and speak with Richard Florida. Dr. Florida has distinquished                    himself as author of The Rise of the Creative Class for advancing                    the notion that cities that have a wide range of culture, tolerance                    and self-expressive opportunities are cities that lead in bottom-line                    economic progress. This premise is based on a number of studies                    and indicators and can be summarized in a recent review in the                    Washington Monthly:  http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0205.florida.html                                         I'd like to hear what you think. Better yet, your ideas on                    what the business community as well as local government can                    do to facilitate greater awareness and support.
