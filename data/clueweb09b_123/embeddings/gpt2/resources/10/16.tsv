Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   Mary finds the key to the secret garden and a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden beneath overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle briefly meets with her for the first time since her arrival, Mary asks him for permission to claim her own garden from any abandoned part of the grounds, and he acquiesces. Thanks to her new-found interests and activities, Mary herself begins to blossom, losing her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive. They tell her that she is hearing things, or they blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind, or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums.   Colin accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often, but as spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous that Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon. One day, Colin threatens to ban Dickon from the grounds, but Mary matches his bad temper and storms out without an apology. That evening, Colin escalates into a  hysterical  tantrum, convinced that he is becoming hunchbacked and is going to die; Mary shocks him out of his hysteria by screaming back at him. She also demands to see his back, and points out that the lumps behind his neck are simply the outlines of normal  vertebrae  like her own. Reassured, Colin agrees to let her bring Dickon to visit him inside his room, and they become friends.   They bring Colin outside in a wheelchair so he can see his mother's garden. Delighted, he visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows, ordering everyone else to stay away on those occasions. Despite these orders, the children are discovered by the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff, who tried to maintain the roses after Lilias' death by surreptitiously scaling the wall once or twice a year. Ben is angry with them at first, but agrees to share and keep their secret.   As the garden revives and flourishes, so does Colin. He resolves to walk and run like a normal boy by the next time his father returns home; to accomplish these aims, he carries out a program of simple physical exercises and positive thinking. He makes great progress, but they conceal it from the rest of the household with the pretense that he is still an invalid.   Mr. Craven is traveling through Europe, but is inspired to rush home after hearing the voice of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here."" He arrives while the children are outdoors and finds himself drawn toward the secret garden. As he approaches nearer, he is astonished to hear their voices inside the walls; Colin bursts out of the garden door toward him, actually winning a footrace against Mary and Dickon. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. When they return to the house, the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.     [ edit ]   Major themes   The author, Frances Hodgson Burnett, was a practitioner of  Christian Science  due to the premature death of her son as well as personal illness. [ 2 ]  As a result,  The Secret Garden  espouses the concepts of  New Thought  and  theosophy  as well as ideas about the healing powers of the mind. [ 3 ]   The garden is the book's central symbol. The secret garden at Misselthwaite Manor is the site of both the near-destruction and the subsequent regeneration of a family. [ 4 ]  Using the garden motif, Burnett explores the healing power inherent in living things.   Maytham Hall in  Kent, England , where Burnett lived for a number of years during her marriage to Stephen Townesend, is often cited as the inspiration for the book's setting.  [ 5 ]  Burnett kept an extensive garden, including an impressive rose garden. However, it has been noted that besides the garden, Maytham Hall and Misselthwaite Manor are physically very different. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Publication history   The Secret Garden  was first serialized, starting in autumn 1910, in  The American Magazine , a publication aimed at adults. The entire book was first published in summer 1911 by Frederick A. Stokes in New York and by  Heinemann  in London. Its  copyright  expired in the US in 1987 and in most other parts of the world in 1995, placing the book in the  public domain .     [ edit ]   Public reception   Marketing to both adult and juvenile audiences may have had an effect on its early reception; the book was not as celebrated as Burnett's previous works during her lifetime.  [ 7 ]   The Secret Garden  paled in comparison to the popularity of Burnett's other works for a long period. Tracing the book's revival from almost complete eclipse at the time of Burnett's death in 1924, Anne H. Lundin noted [ 8 ]  that the author's obituary notices all remarked on  Little Lord Fauntleroy  and passed over  The Secret Garden  in silence.   With the rise of scholarly work in children's literature over the past quarter-century,  The Secret Garden  has steadily risen to prominence, and is now arguably Burnett's best-known work. The book is often noted as one of the best children's books of the twentieth century  [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Dramatic adaptations   The Secret Garden  has been adapted many times for other media. The following list is non-exhaustive and omits various items in audio and print format such as  audiobooks ,  radio plays ,  abridged   storybooks , and random derived works such as  cookbooks  and  paper dolls . The appendices of the book's  Norton Critical Edition  contain a more comprehensive analysis of the book's many transformations.     [ edit ]   Live-action     [ edit ]   Films   The first filmed version was made in 1919 by the  Famous Players-Lasky Corporation  with 17 year old  Lila Lee  as Mary and  Paul Willis  as Dickon, but the film is considered lost.   In 1949,  MGM  filmed  the second adaptation  with  Margaret O'Brien . This version was mostly in black-and-white, but the sequences set in the restored garden were filmed in  Technicolor .   The most acclaimed film adaptation is  American Zoetrope 's  1993 production . It was directed by  Agnieszka Holland  and starred  Kate Maberly  as Mary,  Heydon Prowse  as Colin,  Andrew Knott  as Dickon and  Dame Maggie Smith  as Mrs. Medlock.     [ edit ]   Television   Dorothea Brooking  adapted the book into several different television serials for the BBC: an eight-part serial in 1952, a six-part serial in 1960 (starring  Colin Spaull  as Dickon), and a three-part serial in 1975.   In 1987,  Hallmark Hall of Fame  filmed a TV adaptation of the novel starring  Gennie James  as Mary,  Barret Oliver  as Dickon, and  Jadrien Steele  as Colin.  Derek Jacobi  plays the role of Archibald Craven, with  Alison Doody  appearing in flashbacks and visions as Lilias; a young  Colin Firth  also makes a brief appearance as the adult Colin Craven.     [ edit ]   Stage   Stage adaptations of the book have also been created.  One notable adaptation  is a  musical  with music by  Lucy Simon  and book and lyrics by  Marsha Norman , which opened on  Broadway  in 1991. The production was nominated for seven  Tony Awards , winning Best Book of a Musical and Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Daisy Eagan  as Mary, at eleven years old is the youngest person ever to win a Tony).   In 2007 the  Orlando Shakespeare Theater  commissioned April-Dawn Gladu to create an adaptation for their Theater For Young Audiences series. This version's unique qualities include an actress silently playing The Garden Tree, which was the tree that Lilias fell from years ago. As the children work secretly in the garden to bring it to life, the living tree wakes up, flourishes and blooms. [ 10 ]   Oakland Ballet has produced  The Secret Garden  set to music by Sir Edward Elgar. [ 11 ]   The Secret Garden  has also been made into an opera by Clover Loehr & Conan McLemore, and will be presented by Northwest Children's Opera in June of 2009.     [ edit ]   Animation   In 1991, a  Japanese animated  version of  The Secret Garden  was made, entitled  Himitsu no Hanazono . [ 12 ]   As part of the ""ABC Weekend Special"" series, another animated version was made in 1995, with  Derek Jacobi  as the voice of Archibald Craven.   Another anime movie,  Sk no Strain  (2006), based on another Frances Hodgson Burnett novel,  A Little Princess , draws some elements from  The Secret Garden , mostly the names of Colin, Mary, Martha and Dickon. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Sequels     [ edit ]   Written works   Noel Streatfeild 's 1949 novel  The Painted Garden  (U.S. title  Movie Shoes ) has as its central story the filming of  The Secret Garden  in Hollywood. A novel about the adult lives of Mary, Colin, and Dickon was written by  Susan Moody  in 1995 and published under two different titles:  Misselthwaite: The Sequel to the Secret Garden  and  Return to the Secret Garden . The  New York Times  also published a brief parodic sequel [ 14 ]  in 1995. A different sequel novel,  Till All the Seas Run Dry , was written by Susan Webb and published in 1998.     [ edit ]   Dramatic media   A 2000 sequel entitled  Return to the Secret Garden  was directed by  Scott Featherstone  and won the Director's Gold Award at the 2001 Santa Clarita International Film Festival. [ 15 ] [ 16 ]   In 2001, the  TV movie   Back to the Secret Garden , directed by Michael Tuchner, shows Mary and Colin as married adults who have made Craven Manor into a shelter for orphans. It starred  Joan Plowright  as Martha and  George Baker  as Will Weatherstaff (a younger relative of Ben Weatherstaff), with  Camilla Belle  as an American orphan, Lizzie.

Orphaned by an outbreak of  cholera , she is sent back to England to the legal guardianship of her only remaining relative: her father's brother-in-law, Archibald Craven, a reclusive widower.   Craven still mourns the death of his beautiful young wife, Lilias, from ten years ago. To escape his sad memories, he constantly travels abroad, leaving Mary and the  manor  under the supervision of his  housekeeper , Mrs. Medlock. The only person who has any time for the little girl is the  chambermaid  Martha Sowerby, who tells Mary about a walled garden that was the late Mrs. Craven's favorite. No one has entered the garden since she died because Archibald locked its entrance and buried the key in an unknown location.   After Mary finds the key to the secret garden, a  robin  shows her where the door is hidden by overgrown ivy. Once inside, she discovers that although the roses seem lifeless, some of the other flowers have survived. She resolves to tend the garden herself. Although she wants to keep it a secret, she recruits Martha's brother Dickon, who has a way with plants and wild animals. Mary gives him money to buy gardening implements and he shows her that the roses, though neglected, are not dead. When Mary's uncle visits the house briefly for the first time since she arrived, Mary asks him for a bit of earth to make a flower garden, and he agrees. Thanks to the invigorating Yorkshire air and her new-found fascination with the garden, Mary herself begins to blossom, and loses her sickly look and unpleasant manner.   On several occasions, Mary hears someone weeping in another part of the house. When she asks questions, the servants become evasive; they tell her that she is hearing things, or blame the sound on ordinary sources such as the wind or a servant with a toothache. Shortly after her uncle's visit, she goes exploring and discovers her uncle's son, Colin, a lonely, bedridden boy as petulant and disagreeable as Mary used to be. His father shuns him because the child closely resembles his mother. Mr. Craven is a mild  hunch back , and both he and Colin are morbidly convinced that the boy will develop the same condition. The servants have been keeping Mary and Colin a secret from one another because Colin doesn't like strangers staring at him and is prone to terrible tantrums. Colin, however, accepts Mary and insists on her visiting him often.   As spring approaches, Colin becomes jealous because Mary is spending more time out in the garden with Dickon than indoors with him. One day he voices his resentment and, when Mary resists, he throws a tantrum. To the surprise and amusement of the servants, Mary continues to stand her ground. That evening, Colin has a  hysterical  fit, brought on by his fear of dying young. Mary goes to him and, again taking a firm, no-nonsense stance with him, slaps him in the face to shock him out of his hysteria; to the servants' surprise, when Mary screams back at him, he doesn't object.   When Colin asks if he can visit the garden with her, she agrees, as she and Dickon had been planning to suggest it themselves, feeling that it would do Colin good. Colin's doctor, who is Mr. Craven's cousin, agrees to let Dickon and Mary take Colin outside in a wheelchair. To maintain their secret, Colin orders everyone else to stay out of the gardens on those occasions. Colin is delighted with his mother's garden, and visits it with Mary and Dickon whenever the weather allows. As the garden revives and flourishes, so does he.   The first adult to discover what the children are doing is the old gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, who was a favorite of Colin's mother. After her death, he visited the locked garden once or twice a year by secretly scaling the wall with a ladder. When he visits the garden for the first time since Mary's arrival (having had to miss several visits because of  rheumatism ), he is angry with the children until he sees how improved both the garden and Colin are. Colin orders him not to tell anybody, and he agrees. Colin resolves that the next time his father returns from abroad he will be able to walk and run like a normal boy. He accomplishes this through a combination of simple physical exercise taught by Dickon and positive thinking. He refuses to think of himself as crippled, and he invents a kind of  mantra  to keep himself in the right, or ""magic,"" frame of mind. He makes great progress, but keeps it hidden from everyone but Mary, Dickon, and Ben, wanting it to be a surprise.   Mr. Craven has been traveling throughout Europe, but is inspired to rush home after seeing a vision of his dead wife in a dream and receiving a letter from Mrs. Sowerby (Martha's and Dickon's mother, who also knows the secret) telling him, ""I think your lady would ask you to come if she was here"". He arrives while the children are outdoors. He goes out to see Colin for himself, and finds himself drawn to the secret garden, where he is astonished to hear children's voices and then to find Colin not only racing Mary and Dickon around the garden, but winning. They take Mr. Craven into the secret garden to tell him everything. Afterwards they walk back to the house, where the servants are astonished to see two miracles: Colin walking and his father looking happy again.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon , and the upcoming sequel to the  The Da Vinci Code ,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.   On a  VH1  special about the 100 greatest  Child Stars , many of the interviewees considered Ron Howard to be the most successful child star of all-time, considering his two major television acting roles and his directing career. [ citation needed ]  In Season 1, Episode 3 of  Stroker and Hoop  on  Adult Swim , Stroker and Hoop ran a detective agency whose first client needed them to make Ron Howard stop controlling his mind.   In October 2008, Howard reprised his roles as Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham for the first time in over 20 years when he appeared in a video on  funnyordie.com  in which he endorsed Barack Obama and urged people to vote. The video, titled  ""Ron Howards Call to Action"" , [ 6 ] also features  Andy Griffith  and  Henry Winkler . As seen in the video, Howard is seen shaving his beard and having hair done to recreate his younger look.

Howard came to prominence in the 1960s while playing  Andy Griffith 's TV son,  Opie Taylor , on  The Andy Griffith Show  (credited as Ronny Howard), and later in the 1970s as Howard Cunningham's son and  Arthur Fonzarelli 's best friend,  Richie Cunningham , on  Happy Days  (a role he played from 1974 to 1980). Since retiring from acting, he has directed many films including  Apollo 13 ,  A Beautiful Mind ,  Frost/Nixon , and the upcoming sequel to the  The Da Vinci Code ,  Angels and Demons .

[ 1 ]  His family later moved to  Burbank, California , just the year before his parents gave birth to his younger brother,  Clint Howard . Howard graduated from  John Burroughs High School , and later attended the  University of Southern California 's  School of Cinematic Arts  but did not graduate. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Career     [ edit ]   Early acting roles and  The Andy Griffith Show   Howard first earned recognition for playing Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp in the film version of  The Music Man  with  Robert Preston  and  Shirley Jones . Besides appearing in  The Music Man , he appeared in the role of  Opie Taylor  in the television series  The Andy Griffith Show , which was the successful spin-off of  The Danny Thomas Show . There he portrayed the son of the local sheriff in the fictional town of  Mayberry ,  North Carolina . For eight seasons, he created a loving relationship with  Andy Griffith  on-screen, and spent a lot of time with him off-screen when not filming. The credits referred to him as ""Ronny Howard."" He also appeared in the 1963 film  The Courtship of Eddie's Father  with  Glenn Ford  and (billed as ""Ronnie Howard"") in  Little Boy Lost , a 1963 episode of the  NBC   medical drama   The Eleventh Hour  as the character Barry Stewart in the episode entitled ""Is Mr. Martian Coming Back?"", and a 1966 episode of the NBC  adventure  series  I Spy  with  Robert Culp  and  Bill Cosby .   Howard made a notable guest-star appearance on the popular television series  M*A*S*H  during that show's first season as an  underage  American serving in  the Marines  during the  Korean War . In  1976 , Howard was offered the role of Gillom Rogers in the movie  The Shootist , starring opposite Hollywood legend  John Wayne . At the time, Howard had no idea that this would be the last pairing of the two, as Wayne would die three years later of cancer; in fact, Howard is often quoted as saying: "" About a couple of months after filming wrapped on The Shootist, Duke called me up and said, 'I found a good script, kid . . . it's you and me, or it's nobody.' "" As a token of respect, during the beginning of "" The Shootist ,"" Howard lent his voice to the beginning montage, which shows Wayne in various clips from his career.     [ edit ]   American Graffiti  and  Happy Days   Howard played Steve Bollander in  George Lucas '  teen movie   American Graffiti  in 1973. The role led to him being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series  Happy Days  on which, beginning in 1974, he played the likeable ""buttoned-down"" boy, in contrast to  Henry Winkler 's "" greaser ""  Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli . In 1977, while still starring on  Happy Days , he directed his first film, a  low-budget   comedy / action film  called  Grand Theft Auto .   His last significant on-screen role was when he reprised his famous role as Opie Taylor in the 1986 TV reunion movie  Return to Mayberry  reuniting him with  Andy Griffith ,  Don Knotts , and most of the old cast.     [ edit ]   Directing   Before leaving  Happy Days  in 1980, Howard made his directing debut with the 1977 project  Grand Theft Auto  (after cutting a deal with  Roger Corman  to star in  Eat My Dust  with  Christopher Norris ). Howard went on to direct several TV movies. His big theatrical break came in 1982 with  Night Shift  featuring soon-to-be stars, such as  Michael Keaton  and  Shelley Long , as well as reuniting Howard with  Happy Days  co-star  Henry Winkler .   He has since directed a number of high-visibility films, including  Splash ,  Parenthood ,  Cocoon ,  Apollo 13  (nominated for nine  Academy Awards  and winning two),  A Beautiful Mind  (for which he won the  Academy Award for Best Director ),  Cinderella Man  and  The Da Vinci Code .   Howard's younger brother,  Clint , has minor roles in most of his movies.   Howard showcased the world premiere of his newest film  Frost/Nixon  at the 2008 London Film Festival in October 2008. [ 3 ]     [ edit ]   Imagine Entertainment   Howard is the co-chairman, with  Brian Grazer , of  Imagine Entertainment , a major film and television production company, which has produced notable projects like  Friday Night Lights ,  8 Mile ,  Inside Deep Throat , and the television series  24  and  Felicity .   Through his company  Imagine Television , Howard continues to have a presence in television, most recently as the executive producer and uncredited  narrator  of the critically acclaimed  FOX  sitcom  Arrested Development . The show, despite having won six Emmy awards and near-unanimous praise from critics, did not enjoy high  ratings  and was limited by  Fox Television  in 2006 due to FOX scheduling the show opposite major events on other stations. A series finale took place in February 2006, but Howard, on-screen for the first time in the show, suggested a movie version may be in the works. In February 2008,  Jeffrey Tambor  and  Jason Bateman  confirmed that a movie is, in fact, going to be made with a possible 2009 release. Creator  Mitchell Hurwitz  is writing the screenplay, while Howard will direct. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Personal life   On June 7, 1975, Howard wed his high-school sweetheart, Cheryl ( ne  Alley), a writer with a degree in geriatric psychology. They have four children; daughters  Bryce Dallas Howard  (b. 1981), Jocelyn Carlyle and Paige Carlyle (twins, b. 1985), and son Reed Cross (b. 1987). His daughters' middle names indicate where they were conceived, Bryce in Dallas, twins Jocelyn and Paige at the Hotel Carlyle in New York City. Son Reed Cross was named after a London street because ""Volvo isn't a very good middle name"", according to Howard. [ 5 ]  Daughters Bryce and Paige are actresses. The family lives on a 35-acre (140,000 m 2 ) estate in the exclusive gated community of  Conyers Farm  in  Greenwich, Connecticut . In February 2007, Howard became a grandfather when his daughter, Bryce, gave birth to a son, Theodore Norman Howard Gabel.   Howard was the sixth cousin to his  Andy Griffith Show  co-star,  Don Knotts , through Howard's ancestor, Lucinda Knotts.   In the June 2006 issue of  Vanity Fair  magazine, Ron Howard was asked, ""What do you consider your greatest achievement?"" He replied, ""Forty-eight consecutive years of steady employment in television and film, while preserving a rich family life.""     [ edit ]   Howard in popular culture   Howard appeared as himself twice in  The Simpsons . In "" When You Dish Upon a Star "",  Homer  meets and befriends  Alec Baldwin ,  Kim Basinger  and Howard. Later in the episode, Howard is injured when trying to jump from a truck to the RV that Homer was driving. In the end, he pitches Homer's movie idea and gets it greenlit. Another episode ("" Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder "") Homer and Howard are fighting each other while appearing on  The Springfield Squares . Later, Howard gives Homer the inspiration to spend more time with his kids and gives him some money that Homer refuses but takes anyway. Ron yoinks the money back from Homer and then drives away.   In the  Family Guy  episode "" You May Now Kiss the...Uh...Guy Who Receives ,"" Stewie humorously threatens Ron's life, saying that he'll be in the Oscars in the section honoring those who died.   When he hosted  Saturday Night Live  in the 1980s,  Eddie Murphy  called him ""Opie Cunningham"". In the  South Park  episode, "" Ginger Kids "",  Cartman  asks a crowd of fellow gingers to name great Americans with red hair, the first and only name they can think of is ""Ron Howard"", and when asked to name a second, one responds ""Ron Howard"" again.

Yes, I have Michael's permission to use his name and his full message and, no, I'm not going to make fun of it -- I thought he gently raised a point worthy of discussion and it's representative of many e-mails I received yesterday. Here's Michael: Bob,  I understand your sentiments when you wrote that article asking what was Barack thinking with the selection. I am a 61 year old individual who can't believe I lived to see the day when someone like Barack could be elected. It made all the dreams I've had since I worked in Bobby Kennedy's campaign come true. However, please look at what Barack's selection is really saying. The first task our new POTUS  will have is to bring us all together after our beloved nation has been purposefully rendered apart for the past eight years for the most nefarious of reasons. It is why I wonder how truly progressive those who call themselves ""progressives"" really are. No POTUS has ever entered office facing the humongous challenges facing Obama and instead of criticizing him I think it is time we get behind him.  Fair enough, Michael, and I agree to some extent with the spirit of what you're saying.  I've spent no time at all criticizing some of President-elect Obama's cabinet selections that may have raised my eyebrows,  including retaining Robert Gates as Defense Secretary.  While I'm inclined to say Obama should start fresh as he moves to end the Iraq debacle, I'm willing to concede that Gates is undoubtedly clear on Obama's intent to leave Iraq and will follow the Commander-in-Chief's directive. I also give Obama credit for wanting to begin the withdrawal with as little upheaval as possible at the Defense Department. I'm also mindful of the huge challenges Obama is inheriting and the extent to which he needs support and not sniping from his own side of the political divide and, the fact is, I donated money and worked hard to help elect the man. I believe in him and I believe he will be a great president. I say all of this to point out that I'm as far from an Obama basher as you'll find and hated even having to write my piece yesterday -- and I strongly considered not posting it precisely for the points you raise. But this situation is different and his choice of Warren does anything but bring us together as a people. Obama is not including someone from the other side of the aisle who has a mere philosophical difference with Progressives/Liberals and who, for example, may take a different stance on Iraq or stem cell research than we do.  On this day of national pride and celebration, he's chosen to include someone who believes that a certain portion of our population should be demonized and deprived of the same rights enjoyed by other Americans. The President-elect has picked someone to share center stage with him on January 20th who is, tacitly, a self-proclaimed bigot, who strongly supports discrimination against the gay community and who believes gay folks are something less than the rest of us. It is as simple as that and, the last time I looked, that kind of bigotry was considered downright un-American. What Warren believes is not exactly the same as the ugliness we saw during the Civil Rights struggle but it's damn close.  And Rick Warren is someone who essentially takes the same approach toward gay people, based simply on their sexual orientation, as George Wallace,  Bull Connor  and that whole Cracker Brigade took against African-Americans in the 1960s. So I appreciate what you're saying, Michael, and the support you believe we should all show for Barack Obama as he charts some incredibly tough waters ahead.  As I said, I believe he will be a great president and that as the next few years unfold, I will feel far more pride and solidarity with him than I will disappointment. But that doesnt make choosing a known bigot to speak on Inauguration Day something we can ignore.  Barack Obama will be taking that oath of office on January 20th because the majority of Americans, as Dr. King longed for,  looked at the content of his character and not the color of his skin. Our gay family, friends and neighbors deserve nothing less than the same standard of decency.                                posted by Bob Geiger at  12/19/2008 12:27:00 PM                                                            Thursday, December 18, 2008                                            Rick Warren???  What Is Team Obama Thinking?                                      Even through my utter euphoria at Barack Obama being elected president, I knew there would be times in the coming years when I would disagree with certain decisions and policy stances taken by our new Democratic president.  That's a natural thing -- I just didnt think one of those moments would come a month before he's even sworn into office. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies,  has announced  a good program to usher in the Obama presidency on January 20th that, most unfortunately, includes rabid homophobe Rick Warren giving the opening prayer. Warren is a prominent evangelical and founded the Saddleback Church in Southern California, strongly supported California's ugly  Proposition 8  and has long fought against gay rights saying that ""this is not a political issue  it is a moral issue that God has spoken clearly about."" He will give the invocation after Inaugural Committee Chairwoman, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) calls the event to order. My friend Pam Spaulding at  Pam's House Blend  has some excellent coverage going on at her site and brings us some failed spin control from the Obama transition team from spokeswoman Linda Douglas:  ""This is going to be the most inclusive, open, accessible inauguration in American history,"" said Douglas. ""The president-elect certainly disagrees with him on [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender] issues. But it has always been his goal to find common ground with people with whom you may disagree on some issues."" Please also check out  AMERICAblog  for what will certainly be outstanding coverage of every aspect of this nonsense. My take on this is that President-elect Obama and his staff are being incredibly disrespectful to Progressives who were a major part of getting the Obama-Biden ticket elected and having Warren anywhere near the festivities on January 20th is just flat-out stupid politically. People in the Religious Right will  never  support Barack Obama or his agenda, so giving a homophobic bigot like Warren such a prominent place on such a special day for our country will do absolutely nothing to gain Obama support from that lot.  Meanwhile, he will piss off a lot of his supporters before he even takes office and will be going against what the mainstream of America thinks by boosting someone who is anti-choice, for continuation of the Iraq occupation and who clearly hates gay people. And, of course, Warren's also at least a partial nut job, as shown in things like the episode on Sean Hannity's show in which he responds to Hannity saying we need to ""take out"" Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by saying that stopping evil is the legitimate role of government. The Bible says that God puts government on earth to punish evildoers. Here's Warren's who-would-Jesus-bomb moment: This isnt change any of us can believe in and Obama needs to find a graceful way to have someone else --  anyone  else -- do the opening prayer on his big day.  He also needs to remember that this isn't just  his  big day, it's also a huge occasion for our country and he has a responsibility to present people who represent the best of American life, not the worst. This isnt a prime-time television special, so it isn't even necessary to pick someone who is well known -- how about a community-organizer member of the clergy who toils with silent dignity and doesn't support and defend discrimination?  How about giving one of them a place on the national stage? But a confirmed bigot?  No way. Update:  If you haven't read  John Aravosis's piece  in the Huffington Post, he does a beautiful job inventing a dialog that explains why the Warren choice is so awful far better than I ever could.

This week, the award goes to Glenn Beck for completing a classic right-wing, two-for-one deal: He  invents  a problem with a Democrat -- in this case, Hillary Clinton -- and then proceeds to analyze and find fault with a situation that nobody envisions and that will never happen. Specifically, Beck was talking to that famed political genius, Joe the Plumber -- and here you thought his 15 minutes were over -- and they were both a bit aghast about the thought of Senator Clinton serving as a U.S. Senator  and  being Secretary of State at the same time.  Of course, that scenario is not planned, nor would it ever happen -- but when you're a conservative radio host, you dont need to worry about having listeners smart enough to call you on this. BuzzFlash comes in right after the part where Beck says that ""&one of my guys who's deep in the Constitution, he's saying that she can't have two offices. That's the problem.""  Hey, Glenn: ""one of my guys"" doesn't know what he is talking about. And neither do you. Nobody, and we mean nobody, thinks Clinton, or anyone else would do both jobs at the same time. Being a U.S. Senator is a lot of work, and being Secretary of State is a huge amount of work. And the whole idea that ""it's kind of iffy on that."" Are you now saying Clinton might legally occupy both posts as you are saying that she couldn't be both? And what does this have to do with the subject being talked about in the United States on the planet Earth? As Keith Olbermann succinctly put it, ""You are less well-informed than Joe the Plumber."" Usually, when the rabid right-winger rants, an argument is presented with lies and misleading statements. Here we have an argument that is a lie, a fiction no one ever thought to create. And Beck doesn't even have the guts to say this from his own heart: he hides behind referring to ""one of my guys who's deep in the Constitution."" To be fair, this is probably why right-wing talk shows such as Beck do get the Republican talking points. Because when they come up with their own talking points, they screw them up. If someone else does not write down for Beck, there apparently is this chance Beck will go off and come up with tangents such as this.

And Chris Cillizza  reports yesterday  that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has made a call to Paterson urging him to select Kennedy -- and if this is true, I agree with Senator Reid. There's two basic schools of thought around Paterson selecting Kennedy to replace Clinton:  One is that she's a political neophyte who has spent her life avoiding the spotlight and that she simply isnt qualified.  The other is that she's serious, smart, has name recognition and star quality -- perhaps those two go hand-in-hand with the Kennedy name? -- and that she'll be up to the task. At this point, I fall into the latter group. There's no doubt that there's more experienced politicians who could get the nod from Paterson, but Republicans are salivating over the thought of possibly being able to pick up this seat in 2010 and who will run best in that race has to be a consideration in the selection process. Although she appears a bit shy and tentative when speaking in public, Caroline Kennedy will grow on the campaign trail in 2010.  I also believe people will be drawn to her and, if appointed, she will make a formidable, compelling candidate two years from now. She will also have strong support from President-elect Obama -- who she endorsed and for whom she campaigned this year -- and she will be helped very ably by Reid, New York's senior Senator Chuck Schumer and will undoubtedly surround herself with an experienced Senate staff who will guide her through all the administrative minutia of the office. We dont know when Paterson will make his choice as the seat is not even formally up for grabs until Hillary Clinton is confirmed for her next job and resigns from the Senate. And I guess you should take my words as just more fodder for a debate that will continue throughout the holiday season.  Especially with me having watched Democrats be such a minority in Washington for the bulk of the last eight years, I fully admit that I'm a fierce partisan who wants nothing more than to extend the Democratic majority in both houses of Congress going forward. So in some ways, I'm a single-issue voter on how this is decided -- and I'm ""voting"" for who I think can retain this Senate seat in 2010.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/17/2008 03:04:00 PM                                                                                                Who To Replace Salazar? It Should Be An Improvement&                                      Now that Senator Ken Salazar (D-CO) has been nominated by President-elect Barack Obama to be the new Secretary of the Interior -- and will certainly be confirmed based on qualifications and a favorable Democratic Senate majority -- all eyes in Colorado go to see who will replace Salazar in the 111th Congress. Salazar was up for reelection in 2010 anyway and whoever this person may be will have to make a full run for the seat then -- this happens anyway when you're appointed to the Senate. In my mind, it will be hard for anyone not to be an improvement over Salazar who as part of the infamous "" Gang of 14 "" in the Senate, proved he is a Democrat who is hardly a lock to vote with the Democratic party on important issues. Nate Silver, at  FiveThirtyEight.com , has a good rundown today on the pool of candidates from which Colorado Governor Bill Ritter will likely make his pick. Please  go here  to read the post. As far as I'm concerned, selecting Senator Salazar's brother John, who is in his third Congressional term for Colorado would be a big mistake.  A conservative Democrat, John Salazar is a member of the disgusting  Blue Dog Caucus  in the House  -- you know, people who wake up and decide over their morning coffee whether they are a Democrat or a Republican on a given day. Obama's new Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) need to be making a few calls to Ritter to urge against that. I lean toward Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper or Congresswoman Diana DeGette.  Both would be improvements over Salazar in the area of Progressive dependability and both would be a boost toward our new president being able to move the agenda that got him elected.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/17/2008 12:49:00 PM                                                            Tuesday, December 16, 2008                                            Reid Announces Senate Committee Chairmanships For 111th Congress                                       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) yesterday announced his recommendations to the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee regarding committee chairmanships for the 111th Congress. I am pleased to recommend these capable men and women to chair the Senates Committees during the 111th Congress,"" said Reid on Monday. ""We have much work to do and many challenges facing our nation. I know that these Senators will be able to deliver on the change that the American people have called for to help move our country in the right direction. Here's the list of anticipated Chairmanships for the 111th Congress. Change in Chairmanship Daniel Inouye (D-HI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations;   Replaces Robert Byrd (D-WV), who resigned his chairmanship. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation;  Was Inouye, who becomes chair of the Appropriations Committee. John Kerry (D-MA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations; Upon the resignation of Joe Biden (D-DE). Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Chairwoman, Senate Intelligence Committee; Was Rockefeller, who will now chair the Commerce Committee. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Chairman, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; Was Feinstein, who will now chair the Intelligence Committee. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Chairwoman, Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship; Was Kerry, who will now be chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. No Change in Chairmanship Herb Kohl (D-WI), Chairman, Senate Special Committee on Aging Tom Harkin (D-IA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture Carl Levin (D-MI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Kent Conrad (D-ND), Chairman, Senate Committee on Budget Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Chairwoman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Max Baucus (D-MT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Joseph Lieberman (I-CT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Byron Dorgan (D-ND), Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Chairman, Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs Final approval will be ratified with an Organizing Resolution when the Senate returns to session in January 2009, but it is highly unlikely that this roster will change.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/16/2008 10:45:00 AM                                                                                                Kerry Comes Full Circle on Foreign Relations Committee                                       On April 22, 1971, young Lieutenant Junior Grade John F. Kerry appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations committee to give testimony in hearings about ending the Vietnam war.  The opportunity put Kerry center stage in the anti-war movement and, sadly,  would later become the linchpin in Republican attacks on his patriotism when he became the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004. Of course the rest is history and the Senate part of Kerry's story began when he was elected to that body in 1984 and he has been a member of the Foreign Relations committee ever since. And things really came full circle on Monday when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) announced that Kerry would be the new chairman of that powerful committee for the 111th Congress, which convenes in January. I am honored to serve as Chairman of a committee which I know from my own experience as a young man can impact the course of our security and help advance our values and interests in the world,"" said Kerry.  ""I look forward to working with all members of the committee to help strengthen Americas hand in Afghanistan and Pakistan, work towards global climate change solutions, and end the war in Iraq responsibly."" ""We have a big agenda ahead of us, just as our country faces big challenges across the globe. During his tenure on the committee, Senator Kerry has chaired the Asia and Middle East subcommittees and authored and passed major legislation on international drug trafficking, global AIDS, international money laundering, and climate change  and negotiated the UNs genocide tribunal to prosecute war crimes in Cambodias Killing Fields. John will do an excellent job as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the nations fortunate to have him in this high position,"" said Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA). ""I know hell make significant contributions to our foreign policy in dealing with the many challenges we face in our relationships with other countries, and hell work well with President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton to restore Americas respect in the world. Kerry assumes his chairmanship with Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) moving on to the White House and the only Democratic colleague with more seniority, Chris Dodd (D-CT), choosing to remain chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/16/2008 09:15:00 AM                                                            Monday, December 15, 2008                                            Another Clue On Why We Like Obama                                      In the January 2009 issue of Esquire magazine, New Mexico Governor and Commerce Secretary nominee Bill Richardson gives us another clue as to why so many Americans have been drawn to Barack Obama.  Here's part of the interview in which Richardson, a Democratic presidential candidate this year,  tells of Obama being a total gentleman and saving his butt during one of the primary debates: As I'm chatting with Obama, the moderator says, ""Governor Richardson, what do you think of that?"" And I look at him like a deer in the headlights. I was about to say that I hadn't heard, when Obama puts his hand over his mouth and says, ""Katrina."" So I gave my four-point plan on Katrina. When I was done and the debate moved on, I looked over and said, ""Thanks, you're okay."" He said, ""Nothing to it, brother."" It confirmed to me that this guy was something special.  There's an old saying about how the word integrity means doing the right thing when nobody is looking -- there you have it.                                 posted by Bob Geiger at  12/15/2008 12:15:00 PM                                                                                                The President-Elect's Weekly Address                                      In case you missed it, here is President-elect Barack Obama with his weekend radio/web address in which he discussed a major part of the country's economic problems -- the mortgage crisis.  He also used the opportunity to formally announce that he has selected Shaun Donovan, New York City's commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development to be the next U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. ""In the end, expanding access to affordable housing isnt just about caring for the least fortunate among us and strengthening our middle class -- its about ending our housing mess, climbing out of our financial crisis, and putting our economy on the path to long-term growth and prosperity,"" said Obama.  ""And that is what Shaun and I will work to do together when I am President of the United States.""

As always, it's a grueling process to narrow the selection to just one Republican hypocrite, and this week BuzzFlash went with one of the most prolific hypocrites in the GOP universe, Rudy Giuliani. This one was a no-brainer, with Giuliani having the nerve to come out recently and say that  it was a good thing for America that  Barack Obama got elected -- after doing everything he could to help the Republicans smear Obama during the presidential campaign. A BuzzFlash excerpt:  So, let's get this straight. Now that a man that you disparaged at every opportunity is our incoming president, we can stop being hypocritical? Clearly Giuliani isn't including himself in that ""we,"" because that statement alone drips with hypocrisy. While he lauds Obama's election these days, it wasn't always so. At the Republican National Convention in September, Giuliani laughed at Obama's work as a community organizer. ""He's never had to lead people in crisis. He is the least experienced candidate for president of the United States in at least the last 100 years,"" Giuliani said in making the case for a President McCain. ""The choice in this election comes down to substance over style."" But that's not the only part about the interview that's two-faced. One of his main points about the positives of having Obama in the White House is that it will improve the United States' image abroad. Yet on July 10, 2008, Giuliani said on ""Morning Joe"" that the reason Obama is so well-liked in Europe is that he captures anti-American sentiment.

Bush's legacy.  And this week, the Wisconsin Senator called on Barack Obama to use his opportunity as president  to ""& take concrete steps to restore the rule of law in this country."" Feingold sent a letter to Obama on Wednesday making this plea and outlining steps he believes are necessary to make that happen. In light of this recent history, I believe that one of the most important things that you can do as President is to take concrete steps to restore the rule of law in this country  that is, to return to the White House respect for an appropriate separation and balance of powers among the branches, for the Presidents important but not paramount place in our constitutional system of government, for the laws that Congress writes and the importance of its oversight functions, and for the judiciarys crucial role in interpreting the law, Feingold wrote. Feingold then offered recommendations for action in four key areas  the separation of powers, excessive government secrecy, detention and interrogation policy, and domestic surveillance and privacy.   He also provided additional points made during a Judiciary Committee hearing he chaired in September called Restoring the Rule of Law. Those recommendations include: Closing the facility at Guantanamo Bay, which the President-elect already supports. Banning torture and establishing a single, government-wide standard of humane detainee treatment Conducting a comprehensive review of Office of Legal Counsel opinions and repudiating or revising those that overstate executive authority Supporting significant legislative changes to the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act Cooperating with congressional oversight, including providing full information to intelligence committees"
