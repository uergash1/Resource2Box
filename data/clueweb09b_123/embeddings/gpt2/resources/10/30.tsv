With spacious, modern, passenger-friendly twin terminals, ONT is less congested and thereby more efficient  on the runways, at the gates and at the centralized car rental center  and thereby, a smart move for arrival and departure in Southern California.                         www.lawa.org/ont/welcomeONT.cfm LA - Ontario International Airport 2900 E. Airport Drive Ontario, CA 91761 Telephone: (909) 937-2700 TDD: (909) 937-2163           Opened September 27, 1998, LA-Ontario International Airport's new, $270 million twin terminals offer great convenience and services for passengers, while making a powerful design statement that places it in the forefront of modern airport architecture. In each of the 265,000 square-foot terminals, a vaulted, glass-enclosed terminal lobby serves as the focal point. The space is completely sky-lit, creating an open, modern feel that is welcoming to busy travelers and affords views of the majestic San Gabriel Mountains just north of Ontario.        The twin terminal approach shortens walking distances between parking lots and the terminals, and between aircraft gates and the ticketing and baggage claim areas. Each terminal is built on two levels, with ticketing and baggage claim on the ground floor, and aircraft gates and passenger services on the second level. The linear arrangement of airline gates creates the easiest traffic pattern for aircraft, minimizing potential for delays.        Nearby all that Southern California has to offer, ONT is a vibrant, growing airport developing impressively with daily nonstop flights to major U.S. cities and through service to many international destinations. ONT's service area includes a population of nearly 5 million business and leisure passengers living and working in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties and portions of north Orange County and east Los Angeles County.
