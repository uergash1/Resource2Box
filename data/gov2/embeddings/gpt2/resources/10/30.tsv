Jeanette Rankin (R-MT) has the distinction of being the first woman elected to serve in Congress. On November 9, 1916, she was elected to the House of Representatives as Montana's Representative-at-Large to the 65th Congress (1917-1919).1 Since that time, 208 other women have served in Congress. A record 75 women serve in the 107th Congress; 62 in the House (44 Democrats and 18 Republicans), and 13 in the Senate (ten Democrats and three Republicans). Of the 209 women who have served in Congress, 178 have served only in the House of Representatives; 24 have served only in the Senate; and seven have served in both houses.2 One hundred thirty-five have been Democrats, and 74 have been Republicans. Edith Nourse Rogers (R-MA) holds the record for length of service by a woman in Congress (35 years). She was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, John Jacob Rogers (R-MA, 1913-1925). Mrs. Rogers served in the House from June 25, 1925, until her death on September 10, 1960.  Women Representatives Of the 185 women who have served in the House, 35 were elected to fill vacancies caused by the death of their husbands.3 Fifteen of the 35 were subsequently elected to additional terms. Eighteen women have been elected to fill other vacancies caused by death or resignation. Of these, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA, 1987- ) was first elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of another woman, Sala Burton (D-CA,  Reps. Rankin (R-MT) and Patsy Mink (D-HI,) are the only female Members to have served non-consecutive terms. Rep. Rankin served from 1917-1919 and from 1941-1943. Rep. Rankin was also the only Member of Congress to vote against America's entry into both World Wars. Rep. Mink served from 1965-1977. She is also a Member of the 107th Congress, having served since September 1990, when she was seated following a special election. 2  1  These numbers include one Delegate from Hawaii, one from the District of Columbia, and one from the U.S. Virgin Islands. This number includes Reps. Lois Capps (D-CA) and Mary Bono (R-CA ), both first elected to the 105th Congress in 1998, and Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), first elected to the 104th Congress in 1996. 3   CRS-2 1983-1987). Four additional women have directly succeeded other women by defeating them or being elected to open seats.4  Women Senators Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-GA) was the first woman to serve in the Senate. She was appointed in 1922 to fill the unexpired term of a Senator who had died in office. In addition to being the first female Senator, Ms. Felton holds two other Senate records. Her tenure in the Senate remains the shortest ever (one day), and at the age of 87, she was the oldest person ever to begin Senate service. Besides Ms. Felton, 30 other women, including the 13 in the 107th Congress, have served in the Senate. Of these 31 women, 13 were initially appointed to the Senate. Five, including Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), elected in 1992, and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), elected in 1993, were first elected to fill unexpired terms. Two of the women were first elected and seven were first appointed to fill vacancies caused by the death of their husbands, including Jean Carnahan (D-MO), who was appointed to the 107th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by her husband's posthumous election to the Senate.5 One woman, Senator Elaine Edwards (D-LA), was appointed in 1972 by her husband, then-Governor Edwin Edwards, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Allen Ellender (D-LA, 1937-1972). Another woman, Eva Bowring (R-NE, 1954), who had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Dwight Griswold (R-NE, 1952-1954), was succeeded by another woman, Hazel Abel (R-NE, 1954), who was elected to fill the remaining months of Senator Griswold's term. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS, 1979-1997) was the first of the seven women elected to the Senate without first having been elected to the House or having been elected or appointed to fill an unexpired Senate term. The others are Susan Collins (R-ME ), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), all Members of the 107th Congress, as well as Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999) and Paula Hawkins (R-FL, 1981-1987). Four states (California, Kansas, Maine, and Washington) have been represented by women Senators serving in the same Congress. In the 107th Congress, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein represent California; Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe represent Maine, and Patti Murray and Maria Cantwell represent Washington. In the 104th Congress, Nancy Landon Kassebaum and Sheila Frahm represented Kansas.  Rep. Enid Greene (R-UT, 1995-1997) defeated Rep. Karen Shepherd (D-UT, 1993-1995), Rep.

Diana DeGette D-CO, 1997- ) succeeded Rep. Patricia Schroeder (DCO, 1973-1997). 5  4  Two of the nine were subsequently elected to additional terms.   CRS-3 Hattie Caraway (D-AR) was the first of the 17 women to be elected to a full sixyear Senate term. She was first appointed in 1931 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Thaddeus H. Caraway (D-AR, House, 1913-1921; Senate, 1921-1931), and then was subsequently elected to two six-year terms. She served until January 1945. The other women elected to six-year terms are Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX ), Patty Murray (DWA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME ), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Susan Collins (R-ME ), Blanche Lincoln (D-AK ), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (DMI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA ), Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME), Maurine Neuberger (D-OR), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS, 1978-1997), Paula Hawkins (R-FL, 1981-1987), and Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999).  Women Who Have Served In Both Houses Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress, as well as the first woman elected to the Senate without first having been elected or appointed to fill a vacant Senate seat. Senator Smith was first elected to the House to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband (R-ME, 1937-1940), and served from June 10, 1940, until January 3, 1949, when she began her Senate service. When Mrs. Smith left the Senate on January 3, 1973, she had served there longer than any other woman. Her 24 years of service is still a record for Senate service by a woman. Barbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, Blanche Lincoln, Debbie Stabenow, and Maria Cantwell are the other women who have served in both houses. Senator Mikulski was a Member of the House from 1977-1987, Senator Boxer from 1983-1993, Senator Snowe from 1979-1995, Senator Lincoln from 1993-1997, Senator Stabenow from 1997-2001, and Senator Cantwell from 1993-1995. All are Members of the 107th Congress, and all but Senators Lincoln and Cantwell were elected while still serving in the House.

Asian American Women in Congress Patsy Mink (D-HI) is the first of two Asian Pacfic American women to have served in Congress. A Member of the 107th Congress, Representative Mink first served in the House from 1965-1977. Her present service began in 1990. The other Asian-American woman was Patricia Saiki (R-HI), who served in the House from 1987-1991.

She was married to Representative and Senator Medill McCormick (R-IL, House, 1917-1919, Senate, 1919-1925) prior to becoming a Member of Congress. Medill McCormick died while serving in the Senate. Subsequently, Ms. McCormick was elected to Congress, and she and Representative Albert Gallatin Simms (R-NM, 1929-1931), with whom she had served, were married after they both had left Congress. Finally, Representative Emily Taft Douglas (D-IL, 1945-1947) preceded her husband, Senator Paul Douglas (D-IL, 1949-1967), in Congress.  Fathers Representative Ruth McCormick, discussed above, was also the daughter of Senator Marcus Hanna (R-OH, 1897-1904). Two women have been elected to complete the House terms of their fathers. Winnifred Mason Huck (R-IL, 19221923) was elected to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her father, William E.

Committee Assignments S. Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry S. Judiciary Congress 95th 95th  Note: Prior to the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, effective October 15, 1933, the terms of Representatives and Senators began on March 4, in conformance with a resolution of the Continental Congress implementing the Constitution (adopted September 13, 1788). The Twentieth Amendment provides inter alia that the terms of Representatives and Senators shall commence at noon on January 3, in the year following their election. The first Congress affected by the Twentieth Amendment was the 74th (19351937). However, Congress sometimes sets a date other than January 3 for commencement of a new Congress; thus, in this report, dates sworn in are sometimes later than January 3 for Members elected in the general election. In addition, Members elected to fill a vacancy are sworn in and commence their terms as soon as possible, as do Senators appointed to fill a vacancy.   CRS-9 ANDREWS, ELIZABETH B.

However, a growing trend among CPA firms is causing concern among regulators. A number of CPA firms, both multistate and local, have begun using the burgeoning outsourcing and technology markets in India to process client tax returns. According to Kevin Robert, Chief Executive of CCH Tax Compliance, a tax software company that provides software for an India-based outsourcer, the work being performed is not simple data entry. ""We're taking in raw tax-source information and there are going to be levels of interpretation,"" he said in an interview with the Seattle Times. Although the North Carolina Accountancy Statutes and Administrative Code do not expressly prohibit the practice of outsourcing the preparation of client tax returns, there are several rules a CPA must consider when outsourcing services. One prime concern is maintaining the confidentiality of client records. Pursuant to 21 NCAC 8N .0205, Confidentiality, a CPA shall not disclose any confidential information obtained in the course of employment or a professional engagement except with the consent of the employer or client. To process a tax return, the preparer must have sensitive client information such as the client's Social Security Number, date of birth, bank and brokerage statements, credit card information, salary, etc. In short, much of the information that can be used to perpetrate identity theft. Although some outsourcing centers promise to protect financial information by eliminating the workers ability to download, print, scan or copy financial data, critics of outsourcing question how tax returns can be processed without workers being able to perform those tasks. Ultimately, the CPA firm has the responsibility to ensure the confidentiality of its clients'information. In addition, CPA firms, like banks and brokerage firms, are covered under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which governs financial privacy. Under the Act, the mandatory annual privacy notice must state with whom a company shares its clients' non-public information, how the company protects or safeguards that information, and how a client may opt out of having that information shared with other companies like outsourcing centers. The competence of the workers at the outsource centers is also of concern to regulators; the workers may have minimal training and may have no background in US tax law. 21 NCAC 8N .0212, Competence, requires that a CPA shall perform professional services competently and shall exercise due professional care in the performance of an engagement. Pursuant to 21 NCAC 8N .0301, Professional Judgment, a CPA shall not subordinate the CPA's professional judgment to non-CPAs. Although some of the companies that offer outsourcing in India promise to hire only Chartered Accountants with an education that is as least equivalent to a CPA's education and training in US tax law, the CPA firm using the outsource center must be diligent in selecting a company in which the workers are properly educated and trained. If your CPA firm has professional liability insurance coverage, you should check with your insurance carrier to see if your policy covers the firm when using an outsource center. The accuracy of the tax return remains the ultimate responsibility of the CPA firm and all returns prepared by an outsource center must be reviewed by the CPA firm and the signing CPA. Consolidations in the accounting industry have created unprecedented change--competition is more intense than ever. As the pressure for better bottom line results increase, outsourcing is seen as one solution. If your CPA firm is considering outsourcing the preparation of client tax returns, remember that a North Carolina CPA is responsible for ensuring that any partner, shareholder, officer, director, unlicensed principal, proprietor, employee or agent, including outsource personnel comply with the Board's rules on Professional Ethics and Conduct.

She especially took pleasure in helping find alternatives for meeting the exam application requirements for those one or two percent of the applicants who didn't fit the mold. Judie felt that it was important that each applicant be given the information that he or she needed so that each individual could be one step closer to attaining his or her goal of becoming a CPA. Judith Ann Eastwood Macomber 1942 - 2003 It is with great sadness that the North Carolina State Board of CPA Examiners announces the death of Judith Macomber, the Board's Examinations Manager. Judie, as she was known to friends and family, passed away July 24, 2003, as the result of injuries she received in a fall on July 20, 2003. A Service of Remembrance was held on July 27, 2003, at Brown-Wynne in Raleigh. Judie was born October 9, 1942, in Huntington, NY, to Frances R. Eastwood and the late James W. Eastwood. Raised in Rhode Island, Judie graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1964 with a Bachelor of Science in Home Economics Education with a minor in English. She later continued her education by taking graduate-level classes at East Carolina University in Greenville, NC. In October 1986, Judie joined the Board staff as Examinations Manager, and one month later, she administered the November 1986 Uniform CPA Exam in Raleigh--the first time the exam had been given at the Raleigh Convention and Conference Center. Judie was an avid and eclectic reader who enjoyed solving crossword and jigsaw puzzles. She also enjoyed traveling, and in recent years, had visited Italy, England, and Scotland. Diagnosed with diabetes as a child, Judie refused to let the disease put a damper on her zest for living--she became a certified SCUBA diver when she was in her 50s. In 2000, the Joslin Center for Diabetes recognized Judie for living courageously with diabetes for 50 years. Judie will best be remembered for her sense of humor, unflagging energy, and tenacious drive. She gave her friendship unconditionally, and as result had hundreds of friends not only across the United States, but also around the world. To the Board staff, Judie was more than a co-worker, she was family, and we will miss her greatly. Judie is survived by her beloved mother, Frances R. Eastwood, of Raleigh, NC; her brother, David R. Eastwood, of Port Washington, NY; her daughter, Lisa Macomber Pauer, of Brevard, NC; her son, Steven E. Macomber, of Charlotte, NC; and her grandchildren, Barrett, Erica, and Zoe; and her great love, David McLemore, CPA, of Clinton, NC. Memorial contributions may be made to the Joslin Diabetes Center, One Joslin Place, Boston, MA 02215.  One of Judie's favorite poems was James Leigh Hunt's, Abou Ben Adhem, which was written in 1834: Abou Ben Adhem Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!) Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, And saw, within the moonlight in his room, Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, An Angel writing in a book of gold: Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, And to the Presence in the room he said, ""What writest thou?"" The Vision raised its head, And with a look made of all sweet accord Answered, ""The names of those who love the Lord."" ""And is mine one?"" said Abou. ""Nay, not so, "" Replied the Angel. Abou spoke more low, But cheerily still; and said, ""I pray thee, then, Write me as one who loves his fellow men."" The Angel wrote, and vanished. The next night It came again with a great wakening light, And showed the names whom love of God had blessed, And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest! 3  08-2003.pmd  3  8/12/03, 7:17 AM   Do Not Call Registry The Federal Government has created the National Do Not Call Registry to make it easier and more efficient for you to stop getting telemarketing sales calls you don't want.

Several large businesses--including banks, Internet service providers and on line merchants--have been targeted recently by people who send out ""spoofed"" e-mail masquerading as messages from the companies' accounting or customer service departments. The scam artists send out unsolicited e-mail that typically tells recipients their account information is incomplete or expired and provides a link to fake web pages called ""phishing sites,"" where the victims are asked to type in their data. The spam e-mail looks like it came from the legitimate company. When people plug their personal information into the phishing Web sites--often near-perfect replicas of real sites--the data is sent to thieves, not legitimate companies. ""Bogus e-mails that try to trick customers into giving out personal information are the hottest and most troubling new scam on the Internet,"" Jana Monroe, assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division, said in a recent statement.. The FBI says web spoofing scams are contributing to a rise in identity theft, credit card fraud and other Internet scams. The agency's Internet Fraud Complaint Center has seen a steady increase in complaints from consumers who were directed to phony ""customer service"" web sites by unsolicited e-mail. The number of on line fraud complaints the agency received rose 67% last year to more than 75,000, and consumers reported losses from on line fraud totaling $54 million, the agency reports. The Federal Trade Commission reported earlier this year that cases of identity theft increased about 88% last year, with 161,800 identity theft complaints, up from 86,200 in 2001. Identity theft accounted for 43% of all its fraud complaints, according to the report. Any company doing business on the Internet -- and any person using their services -- could get hooked. ""Before March, we had not seen anything like this, but from March until now, we have seen five or six a month,"" said Susan Getgood, a senior vice president at SurfControl in Scotts Valley, Calif., which makes web and e-mail filtering software. Getgood said that scammers use phishing to cast a wide net because ""they just need to get a few of you."" ""Spam is the organized crime of the Internet, and this is the ultimate crime to date because it damages the victim, and it is also damages the brand of the companies.""

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the PCAOB's rules require the registration of all public accounting firms that issue or prepare audit reports on US public companies, or that play a substantial role in the preparation of such audit reports. Beginning on Oct. 22, 2003, US public accounting firms must be registered with the PCAOB in order to engage in that work. Public accounting firms that wish to apply for registration must do so by completing and submitting Form 1, available to qualified applicants through the PCAOB ' s web site, www.pcaobus.org. 6  Board Meetings September 22 October 20 November 24 December 19 Meetings of the Board are open to the public except, when under State law, some portions of the meetings are closed to the public.

Lois Capps (D-CA) and Mary Bono (R-CA ), both first elected to the 105th Congress in 1998, and Rep. Jo Ann Emerson (R-MO), first elected to the 104th Congress in 1996.   CRS-2 (D-CA, 1983-1987). Representative Pelosi, a Member of the 108th Congress, began her service in 1987. Six additional women have directly succeeded other women by defeating them or being elected to open seats.4  Women Senators Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-GA) was the first woman to serve in the Senate. She was appointed in 1922 to fill the unexpired term of a Senator who had died in office. In addition to being the first female Senator, Ms. Felton holds two other Senate records. Her tenure in the Senate remains the shortest ever (one day), and at the age of 87, she was the oldest person ever to begin Senate service. Besides Ms. Felton, 32 other women, including the 14 in the 108th Congress, have served in the Senate. Of these 33 women, 14 were initially appointed to the Senate, including Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who was appointed to the 108th Congress by her father, Frank Murkowski (R-AK, 1981-2003), to succeed him after he was elected governor of Alaska. Five, including Dianne Feinstein (D-CA, 1992- ) and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX, 1993- ) were first elected to fill unexpired terms. Two of the women were first elected and seven were first appointed to fill vacancies caused by the death of their husbands, including Jean Carnahan (D-MO), who was appointed to the 107th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by her husband's posthumous election to the Senate.5 One woman, Senator Elaine Edwards (D-LA), was appointed in 1972 by her husband, then-Governor Edwin Edwards, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Allen Ellender (D-LA, 1937-1972). Another woman, Eva Bowring (R-NE, 1954), who had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Dwight Griswold (R-NE, 1952-1954), was succeeded by another woman, Hazel Abel (R-NE, 1954), who was elected to fill the remaining months of Senator Griswold's term. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS, 1979-1997) was the first of the eight women elected to the Senate without first having been elected to the House or having been elected or appointed to fill an unexpired Senate term. The others are Susan Collins (R-ME ), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), and Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), all Members of the 108th Congress, as well as Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999) and Paula Hawkins (R-FL, 1981-1987).  4  Rep.

Two of the nine were subsequently elected to additional terms.  5   CRS-3 Hattie Caraway (D-AR) was the first of the 18 women to be elected to a full sixyear Senate term. She was first appointed in 1931 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Thaddeus H. Caraway (D-AR, House, 1913-1921; Senate, 1921-1931), and then was subsequently elected to two six-year terms. She served until January 1945. The other women elected to six-year terms are Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX ), Susan Collins (R-ME), Patty Murray (D-WA), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Blanche Lambert Lincoln (D-AR), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Elizabeth Dole (RNC), all Members of the 108th Congress, as well as Magaret Chase Smith (R-ME, 1949-1973), Maurine Neuberger (D-OR, 1960-1967), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (RKS, 1978-1997), Paula Hawkins (R-FL, 1981-1987), and Carol Moseley-Braun (DIL, 1993-1999). Four states (California, Kansas, Maine, and Washington) have been represented by two women Senators serving in the same Congress. In the 108th Congress, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein represent California; Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe represent Maine, and Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell represent Washington. In the 104th Congress, Nancy Landon Kassebaum and Sheila Frahm represented Kansas.  Women Who Have Served In Both Houses Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME) was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress, as well as the first woman elected to the Senate without first having been elected or appointed to fill a vacant Senate seat. Senator Smith was first elected to the House to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband (R-ME, 1937-1940), and served from June 10, 1940, until January 3, 1949, when she began her Senate service. When Senator Smith left the Senate on January 3, 1973, she had served there longer than any other woman. Her 24 years of service is still a record for Senate service by a woman. Barbara Mikulski, Barbara Boxer, Olympia Snowe, Blanche Lambert Lincoln, Debbie Stabenow, and Maria Cantwell are the other women who have served in both houses. Senator Mikulski was a Member of the House from 1977-1987, Senator Boxer from 1983-1993, Senator Snowe from 1979-1995, Senator Lincoln from 19931997, Senator Stabenow from 1997-2001, and Senator Cantwell from 1993-1995. All are Members of the 108th Congress, and all but Senators Lincoln and Cantwell were elected while still serving in the House.  Women in Leadership Positions Among women in Congress, a significant number have held leadership positions. Former Senator Margaret Chase Smith (D-ME) and Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) have been elected to the highest leadership positions held thus far by women. Representative Pelosi was elected House Democratic whip, in the 107th Congress, on October 10, 2001, effective January 15, 2002. In the 108th Congress,   CRS-4 she was elected the House Democratic leader. She was also the first woman Member to be nominated to be Speaker of the House. Senator Smith was elected chair of the Senate Republican Conference and served from 1967 to 1972. Fourteen women have chaired congressional committees. In the 108th Congress, both Senators from Maine chair committees. This is the first time that two women Members from the same state have been committee chairs. Susan Collins is the chair of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and Olympia Snowe is the chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. During the 104th Congress, a record three women chaired committees. They were Nancy Landon Kassebaum, chair of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee; Jan Meyers (R-KS, 1985-1997), chair of the House Small Business Committee; and Nancy Johnson (R-CT, 1983-present), chair of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct. Others who have chaired committees include Senator Hattie Caraway (D-AR, 1931-1945) and Representatives Edith Nourse Rogers (R-MA, 1925-1960), Mae Ella Nolan (R-CA, 1923-1925), Mary T.

Black Women in Congress A record number of 15 black women served in the House in the 107th Congress; 13 serve in the 108th Congress. A total of 23 black women have served in Congress. The first was Representative Shirley Chisholm (D-NY, 1969-1983). Senator Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL, 1993-1999) is only black woman to have served in the Senate. The black women Members of the 108th Congress include Delegates Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC) and Donna Christian-Christensen (D-VI) and Representatives Maxine Waters (D-CA), Corinne Brown (D-FL), Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Barbara Lee (D-CA), Juanita Millender-McDonald (DCA), Julia Carson (D-IN), Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick (D-MI), Donna ChristianChristensen (D-VI), Stephanie Tubbs Jones (D-OH), Diane Watson (D-CA), and Denise Majette (D-GA).

Representative Mink served in the House from 1965-1977, and from 1990-2002. The other Asian-American woman was Patricia Saiki (R-HI), who served in the House from 1987-1991.   CRS-5  Hispanic Women in Congress Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL, 1989- ) is the first of the seven Hispanic women as well as the first Cuban-American to serve in Congress. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY, 1993- ) is the first Puerto Rican-born woman to serve in Congress. Lucille RoybalAllard (D-CA, 1993- ) is the first Mexican-American woman to serve.

All are Members of the 108th Congress. Representatives Loretta and Linda Sanchez are the first sisters to serve in Congress.  Women Members Whose Relatives Served in Congress Husbands Four women married while in Congress. Two married other Members of the same Congress, and two married Members with whom they served.6 Four other women Members were married to Members with whom they had not served and whom they did not directly succeed.7 Representative Ruth McCormick (R-IL, 1929-1931) twice was married to Members of Congress. She was married to Representative and Senator Medill McCormick (R-IL, House, 1917-1919, Senate, 1919-1925) prior to becoming a Member of Congress. Medill McCormick died while serving in the Senate. Subsequently, Ms. McCormick was elected to Congress, and she and Representative Albert Gallatin Simms (R-NM, 1929-1931), with whom she had served, were married after they both had left Congress. Finally, Representative Emily Taft Douglas (D-IL, 1945-1947) preceded her husband, Senator Paul Douglas (D-IL, 1949-1967), in Congress.  6  Rep. Susan Molinari (R-NY, 1990-1997) married Rep.

Tables and Data The list and tables that follow provide information on women Members of Congress, including the dates they were first elected, the Congresses in which they served, the committees on which they served, and an indication, where relevant, of the committees they have chaired. Most of the data presented are from the Biographical Directory of the American Congress, 1774-1996 [http://bioguide.congress.gov], various editions of the Congressional Directory, and a broad range of Congressional Quarterly and Leadership Directories, Inc. publications. Information on the committee assignments of the women in the 108th Congress was obtained from the Congressional Yellow Book, summer 2003, the website of the U.S. Senate available at [http://www.senate.gov/general/committee_assignments/ assignments.htm]; and List of Standing Committees and Select Committees and Their Subcommittees of the House of Representatives Together with the Joint Committees of the Congress with an Alphabetical List of Members and Their Committee Assignments, One Hundred Eighth Congress, prepared under the direction of Jeff Trandahl, clerk of the House of Representatives, June 6, 2003 (available online from the clerk's website at [http://clerk.house.gov/committee/index.php]). Note that the names and jurisdiction of House and Senate committees have changed many times over the years covered by this report. In the interest of brevity, this report does not identify all historical name changes. The committee names that are listed are those that were in effect at the time a particular member served on a panel.   CRS-8  Alphabetical Listing ABEL, HAZEL HEMPEL. Republican; Nebraska, Senator.

Committee Assignments S. Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry S. Judiciary Congress 95th 95th  Note: Prior to the adoption of the Twentieth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, effective October 15, 1933, the terms of Representatives and Senators began on March 4, in conformance with a resolution of the Continental Congress implementing the Constitution (adopted September 13, 1788). The Twentieth Amendment provides inter alia that the terms of Representatives and Senators shall commence at noon on January 3, in the year following their election. The first Congress affected by the Twentieth Amendment was the 74th (19351937). However, Congress sometimes sets a date other than January 3 for commencement of a new Congress; thus, in this report, dates sworn in are sometimes later than January 3 for Members elected in the general election. In addition, Members elected to fill a vacancy are sworn in and commence their terms as soon as possible, as do Senators appointed to fill a vacancy.   CRS-9 ANDREWS, ELIZABETH B.
