GX239-26-14951807	"SCHOOL FINANCE   IN COLORADO   December 2002   FOREWARD   The purpose of this booklet is to help readers understand how Colorado finances its public elementary and secondary schools. The major focus of this booklet is an explanation of the funding formula included in the Public School Finance Act of 1994, including amendments made to the act in 2002. Several illustrations are provided to help readers calculate funding under the formula. The booklet also describes several other important provisions of law that relate to school district funding. These provisions include a description of revenue that is earmarked for specific functions, other local sources of revenue, and selected specific-purpose programs that provide money to schools and school districts. Please note that this booklet is intended to provide a generic overview of programs that affect funding for schools; state law provides more specific details on the operation of the programs.   This booklet was prepared by the Colorado Legislative Council Staff, the non-partisan research arm of the Colorado General Assembly. It is also available via the Internet at http://www.state.co.us/gov_dir/leg_dir/lcsstaff/schfin/02-03-bkt.htm      TABLE OF CONTENTS             Colorado's School Finance Act       Public School Transportation               The Funding Formula       Vocational Education               What is Total Program?

Currently, these moneys are allocated under a law called the ""Public School Finance Act of 1994."" The school finance act contains a formula that calculates a per pupil funding amount for each school district based on the individual characteristics of the district, such as the cost to live in the district and the number of students enrolled. The act is explained in detail on the following pages, including amendments made under the most recent school finance bill, House Bill 02-1349. Many of the terms used in this booklet relate specifically to school finance, so a glossary is provided beginning on page 43.             THE FUNDING FORMULA       The formula for determining how much funding each school district receives under the school finance act includes several components. This section first describes the formula in general terms and then each component in greater detail.             WHAT IS TOTAL PROGRAM?       ""Total program"" refers to the total amount of funding received by a district under the school finance act, from both state and local sources. A district's total program is simply the number of pupils in the district multiplied by the district's per pupil funding level, plus an amount of funding provided to the district to compensate for the presence of at-risk pupils, plus funding for on-line students.                                     Total Program = (Pupils x Per Pupil Funding) +         At-Risk Funding + On-Line Funding                    The specific components of this formula are described in the following paragraphs along with the steps involved in calculating a district's total program.             How Are Pupils Counted?   Funding under the school finance act is based on the number of pupils enrolled in the school district on October 1. Thus, the number of pupils counted on October 1, 2002, determines funding for the budget year beginning July 1, 2002. Because the fiscal year begins in July, state aid is distributed based on estimated pupil counts. After October 1, when all pupils have been counted, state aid is adjusted to reflect the actual count. The funded pupil count is expressed in full-time equivalent (FTE) pupils to reflect the amount of time a student spends in an instructional setting.   The act provides an alternative to the October 1 count date in certain instances, such as when students in a year-round educational program will be on vacation on October 1. This alternative count date must be within 45 after the first school day after October 1.   The formula also makes enrollment allowances for districts that lose pupils from one year to the next, recognizing that such districts may have difficulty budgeting for fewer pupils. The pupil count for  declining enrollment districts  incorporates the greater of a two-year, three-year, or four-year average of the October counts.  On-line students  are counted separately from students who attend classes at schools. On-line students enrolled during the 2001-02 school year have been grandfathered into the district October counts and are excluded from the on-line count. The funded pupil count formula is illustrated below.                     Funded Pupil Count = On-Line Count + the Greater of       the Current Year's Count, Two-Year, Three-Year, or Four-Year Average of       the October Counts.                       How is Per Pupil Funding Calculated?       Per Pupil Funding Is the Statewide Base Adjusted by a District's Factors     A district's per pupil funding is the result of adjusting the statewide base by the district's cost-of-living factor, personnel costs factor, nonpersonnel costs factor, and size factor. The formula for computing per pupil funding is illustrated below and on page 26.                                     Per         Pupil Funding =           [(Base         x personnel costs factor x           Cost-of-living factor) +           (Base         x    Nonpersonnel Costs Factor)]         x          District Size Factor                         ""Statewide Base"" Is Starting Point     The calculation of each district's per pupil funding starts with a statewide base per pupil funding amount, which is set annually by the General Assembly. The statewide base for FY 2002-03 is $4,441.51, an increase of 5.7 percent ($239.51) over the prior year. Base funding accounts for roughly $3.2 billion of the $4.1 billion allocated under the formula in FY 2002-03, or approximately 77 percent of total program.   Although the General Assembly sets the base annually, Article IX, Section 17 of the Colorado Constitution, commonly referred to as Amendment 23, contains minimum increases for the base. Through FY 2010-11, the General Assembly must increase the base each year by the rate of inflation plus one percentage point. Thereafter, the General Assembly must increase the base by at least the rate of inflation.   A portion of the base is adjusted upward to account for differences in the cost of living in each district. An adjustment is also included for district size as measured by enrollment. A description of each of the components follows.   The Statewide Base Is Adjusted for Cost of Living   Each school district is assigned a factor to indicate the cost of living in the district relative to the cost of living in other districts in the state. The factors for FY 2002-03 and FY 2003-04 range from 1.008 to 1.641. Statewide, $608 million in FY 2002-03 school finance funding can be attributed to the cost-of-living factor, or nearly 15 percent of total program.   The cost-of-living factors are not contained in law, although the method for calculating the factors is. The cost-of-living factors are certified to the Department of Education by the Legislative Council Staff every two years following a study that measures the cost in each district of an identical set of items, such as housing, goods and services, transportation, and taxes. The 2001 cost-of-living study modified the factors for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 budget years. Factors are increased in districts where the study indicates an increase greater than the rate of inflation. The increase is equal to the percentage change in the district's cost of living from the previous study divided by the inflation rate. The increase in the factor is rounded to three decimal places.   District ""Personnel Costs Factor"" Defines the Portion of the Statewide Base Adjusted for Cost of Living   The formula recognizes that differences in cost of living primarily affect the salaries that must be paid to hire and retain qualified personnel. Therefore, the cost-of-living factor is applied only to the portion of the base that relates to personnel, as defined by the personnel costs factor.   Personnel costs factors range from 80.0 percent to 90.5 percent and differ by district according to enrollment; smaller districts have smaller factors. The formula for determining district personnel costs factors is illustrated on page 27.   Each district's  ""nonpersonnel costs factor""  is the difference between 100 percent and the district's personnel costs factor. It is the portion of the base which is  not  adjusted for cost of living and ranges from 20.0 percent to 9.5 percent.   District Size Factor Compensates for Economies of Scale   The act includes a size factor that provides additional money to all school districts, but particularly small school districts unable to take advantage of economies of scale. In FY 2002-03, approximately $183 million is allocated through the size factor, or about 4 percent of total program.   Similar to the personnel costs factor, a size factor is calculated under a formula using district enrollment. The smallest—districts with enrollments of less than 4,023— receive the largest size factor (up to a maximum possible factor of about 2.3458) and, therefore, more funding per pupil. All other districts receive a size factor of 1.0342.   The formula for calculating a school district's size factor appears on page 27.   Since the formula for determining the size factor is based on a district's enrollment, the act acknowledges that the formula inherently provides incentives and disincentives for districts to reorganize and take advantage of the formula. For example, when a reorganization results in a lower size factor, and less funding per pupil, the lower size factor is phased in over six years. When a reorganization results in a higher size factor, and more funding per pupil, the district or districts involved in the reorganization receive the lower size factor of the original district. Thus, the act lessens the negative fiscal impact of reorganization while prohibiting a district from taking advantage of a higher size factor following a reorganization.   The act attempts to minimize the effect that charter schools may have on the size factor of small school districts. The size factor for districts with less than 500 pupils is calculated using the district's enrollment minus 65 percent of the pupils enrolled in charter schools.         What is At-Risk Funding?       Colorado's school finance act provides additional funding for school districts that serve students who are at risk of failing or dropping out of school. The additional funding is based on the district's per pupil funding and the number of at-risk students, in addition to the proportion of at-risk students in the district. The proportion of at-risk students in each district is measured against the statewide average proportion to come up with an ""at-risk factor."" At-risk funding is determined according to the following formula.                                                   At-Risk =        At-Risk Pupils x         At-Risk Factor x Per Pupil Funding              Funding                               In FY 2002-03, the act provides an estimated $149 million in at-risk funding statewide, or about 3.6 percent of total program.       Definition of At-Risk Pupils Follows Federal Free Lunch Program and Includes Some Students with Limited English Skills   Under the act, at-risk pupils are defined as students from low-income families, as measured by eligibility for free lunches under the National School Lunch Act. The definition of at-risk pupils also includes a limited number of non-English-speaking students.   Students qualify for free meals at school based on their family's income. The act defines at-risk pupils as those who are  eligible  for free lunches so districts can receive funding for students that do not actually participate in the federal program. As an alternative, the act allows districts to use the proportion of free-lunch students in grades one through eight multiplied by the district's enrollment if it produces a larger number than the actual count. This alternative count is provided because some high schools do not offer free lunches, and some students choose not to participate in the free lunch program, especially at the high school level.   A student with limited English skills, as defined by the English Language Proficiency Act, can be included in the at-risk count if the student meets one of two criteria. First, a student can be counted if he or she took the Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP) test in a language other than English in the preceding year. Second, a student can be counted if the student took the regular, English CSAP, but the student has been in a Colorado public school for less than three years (two years for third graders). In either case, a student can be counted as at risk only once; therefore, a student who is counted under the income guidelines of the free lunch program cannot be counted because of limited proficiency in English.   Similar to the averaging of pupils for the district count, the at-risk count is averaged to make allowances for the financial impact of declines in the count. A district's at-risk count is the greater of: (1) the actual count for the budget year; (2) an average of the counts for the current and preceding budget years; and (3) an average of the counts for the current and two preceding budget years.   Preschool students are not included in a district's at-risk count. The official date for counting at-risk pupils is October 1.   At-Risk Factor Determines Additional Funding for At-Risk Pupils       The proportion of at-risk students in a district is used to calculate an ""at-risk factor."" This factor determines the amount of funding a district receives for its at-risk pupils. Every district receives an at-risk factor of at least 11.5 percent, which entitles the district to an additional 11.5 percent of its per pupil funding for each at-risk pupil.       Districts with High Concentrations of At-Risk Pupils Receive More Funding   Districts with higher-than-average proportions of at-risk students receive a higher at-risk factor. The increase in the at-risk factor for these districts depends upon the enrollment of the district. For districts with enrollments between 459 and 50,000, the higher factor is equal to 11.5 percent plus three-tenths of a percentage point for each percentage point that the district's at-risk concentration exceeds the statewide average. Thus, if the statewide average incidence is 25 percent, and a particular district has 36 percent of its students defined as at risk, the district's at-risk factor would be 14.8 percent (11.5 + (0.3 x 11) = 14.8). For districts with enrollments greater than 50,000, the higher factor is equal to 11.5 percent plus 0.36 of a percentage point for each percentage point that the district's at-risk concentration exceeds the statewide average.   The higher factor is provided only for pupils over the statewide average incidence of at-risk pupils. So, the district described above with 36 percent at-risk students would receive 11.5 percent more in per pupil funding for 25 percent of its students and 14.8 percent more in per pupil funding for the other 11 percent of its students who are at risk. In addition, only districts with more than 459 pupils qualify for the higher at-risk factor. The higher factor is capped at 30 percent .     What is On-Line Funding?     Beginning with budget year FY 2002-03, new on-line students are funded at the minimum per pupil funding level. For FY 2002-03, this amount is $5,435 per on-line student. Minimum funding increases each year by the rate of increase in the statewide base. Students enrolled in on-line programs for the 2001-02 school year are not included in the on-line count as the minimum funding only applies to new on-line students. Consequently, students already enrolled in on-line programs are funded in the same manner as all other pupils in the district. Beginning with the 2002-03 budget year, the on-line program is expanded to include 135 students annually who were enrolled in a private school or home-school program the preceding year. The General Assembly appropriated $733,725 for this program expansion for FY 2002-03. Further discussion of minimum per pupil funding can be found on page 14.                                                On-line Funding = On-Line Pupil Count x Minimum Per Pupil Funding                                           LOCAL SHARE AND STATE AID       The money to fund total program comes from a combination of local and state sources. In FY 2002-03, local taxpayers are expected to contribute an average of 40.4 percent of total program, while state sources account for the remaining 59.6 percent. These percentages vary widely among individual school districts, however, because districts have different amounts of property wealth. Under the act, each district's local portion is calculated first, and state aid makes up the difference between the local portion and total program. This principle of using state aid to make up for differences in local property wealth is called ""equalization.""             How is the Local Share Calculated?       A district's local share comes from two sources—property taxes and specific ownership taxes. Property taxes are paid on real estate; specific ownership taxes are paid on motor vehicles. Of the two local taxes, property taxes produce roughly eight times as much revenue as specific ownership taxes. Both of these taxes are described in greater detail below.                                       Local            =                      Current Year Property Taxes +                 Share                       Prior Year Specific Ownership Taxes                                 Property Taxes Provide Most Local Revenues     Statewide, property taxes are expected to contribute almost $1.5 billion in funding for school finance in FY 2002-03, or 36 percent of total program. A school district's property taxes are the result of multiplying a district's taxable property (assessed value) by its property tax rate (mill levy). The assessed value of a district is determined each year, and it includes all taxable property in the district. Mill levies are calculated according to a formula in state law which is designed to comply with constitutional limits.   The formula in law requires each district to impose the mill levy from the prior budget year unless that levy will increase property taxes by a greater percentage than allowed. The maximum allowable percentage increase in property taxes for each district is the sum of the state inflation rate and the percentage change in a district's enrollment. If a district's property taxes will exceed that amount with the prior year's levy, the district must reduce its mill levy so that annual change in property tax revenue does not grow faster than the maximum allowed.   The law also includes a ceiling on mill levies. A district's levy cannot be higher than the levy needed to fund the district's total program less specific ownership tax revenue and minimum state aid. This levy calculation is used in a limited number of districts with very high property wealth.         Specific Ownership Taxes Supplement Property Taxes     Specific ownership taxes are expected to contribute about $185 million for school finance in FY 2002-03, bringing the local share to 40.4 percent of total program. Specific ownership taxes are paid annually on motor vehicles instead of property taxes. Counties collect specific ownership taxes and distribute them to all governments in the county that collect property taxes, such as school districts, cities, special districts, and the county itself. By law, counties distribute specific ownership tax revenues to these governments in proportion to the amount of property taxes collected by each. Thus, a school district that receives 50 percent of all the property taxes collected in a county would receive 50 percent of the specific ownership taxes collected in the county.   The funding formula does not count all specific ownership tax revenue against the district's local share, however. Some districts collect more specific ownership taxes than others simply because the voters in those districts have approved additional property taxes. The formula specifically does not count any specific ownership taxes attributable to a bond redemption (debt) or override (operating) mill levy, if the mill levy was approved by the district's voters.   The formula uses specific ownership taxes collected in the previous fiscal year because they are the most recent actual figures. Thus, the local share in FY 2002-03 includes FY 2001-02 specific ownership tax revenue.             How is State Aid Calculated?       State aid provides the difference between a district's total program and the district's local share. In school finance, this concept of state assistance supplementing local resources is called ""equalization."" An equalized school finance system allows similar districts to spend similar amounts regardless of property wealth. For FY 2002-03, state aid is expected to provide $2.48 billion, or 59.6 percent, of total program.                                       State         Aid = Total Program – Local Share                               Districts that produce less from property taxes receive a greater proportion of state aid, but the state guarantees that even the wealthiest districts get a minimum amount of aid per pupil. This per pupil amount, established annually in the long appropriations bill, is based on the amount of school lands and mineral lease moneys received by the state. For FY 2002-03, minimum state aid is $73.40 per pupil.   The state distributes aid to school districts in 12 approximately equal monthly payments. In the first half of the fiscal year, the payments are based upon pupil count and assessed value estimates, because the state does not know exact pupil counts and district assessed values during that time period. The payments are later adjusted to reflect actual pupil counts and assessed values. These approximately equal monthly payments may cause some districts to experience cash flow problems at certain times of the year, so the state offers an interest-free loan program to qualifying school districts. This loan program is discussed in further detail on page   21.   State Aid Comes Primarily from Three Sources     Three sources of revenue provide money for the state aid appropriation for school finance. The state General Fund provides the vast majority of money: in FY 2002-03, 90.8 percent, or just over $2.2 billion, of the appropriation is provided by the General Fund. The state constitution requires that the General Fund appropriation increase by at least 5 percent each year through FY 2010-11, unless Colorado personal income grows by less than 4.5 percent between the two calendar years that precede a fiscal year.   The State Education Fund also contributes to the state aid appropriation. The State Education Fund, created by Article IX, Section 17, of the Colorado Constitution, receives revenue equal to a tax of one-third of one percent on federal taxable income. Its contribution to the state aid appropriation is almost $175 million in FY 2002-03, or 7.1 percent of the state aid package. Finally, rent from state school lands, interest on the Public School Fund, federal mineral lease moneys, and other miscellaneous sources of money provide the remaining 2.1 percent (almost $53 million) of state aid.             MODIFICATIONS TO THE FUNDING FORMULA       The state's basic funding formula applies to nearly all districts. However, the act makes modifications to the formula to account for unusual situations in some districts. These modifications may cause a district's total program to be computed differently than the formula described in the preceding pages. In addition, the act contains modifications that may alter the share of a district's funding that comes from state or local sources. These modifications are reviewed below.             Modifications to Total Program       There are three modifications that cause a district's total program to be computed differently than the formula described in the preceding pages. These modifications provide for a minimum per pupil funding level, a cap on increases in total program, and a cap on annual increases in per pupil funding.       The Law Contains Minimum Per Pupil Funding Levels       A school district can receive a higher per pupil funding level than the formula provides. The law guarantees that all districts will receive at least $5,435 per pupil in FY 2002-03. This funding level applies to any school district that would have a lesser per pupil funding amount under the formula. Seven districts are expected to benefit by about $2.1 million from this minimum per pupil funding provision. The amount of minimum per pupil funding increases each year by the same percentage as the statewide base amount. However, the General Assembly can increase this minimum amount beyond the automatic increase required by law. This was the case for FY 2002-03 as the required minimum funding was $5,391, but was increased an additional $44 to $5,435.     Increases in Total Program Are Capped       Under the act, annual increases in district total program are limited to the respective district's constitutional spending limit percentage (inflation plus the percentage change in district enrollment). The limit in the statute, however, is applied only to school finance funding (property taxes, specific ownership taxes, and state aid), while districts often receive additional funding from other sources. In addition, voters can agree to let a district collect more than the limit, and some money received by districts is exempt from the limit. Thus, the law allows districts to receive the total amount of formula funding if they can certify that the moneys will not cause the district to exceed its constitutional spending limit, when that limit is applied to all of the district's spending from the prior year.       Increases in Per Pupil Funding Are Capped       The act sets a cap on increases in total per pupil funding equal of 25 percent per year.             Modifications to the State and Local Shares       Just as there are exceptions to the calculation of total program, some districts' local share or state aid may be modified depending on a district's particular situation. For example, some districts pay for categorical programs, and state aid may be reduced in certain circumstances.       Some Districts Pay for Categorical Programs       The categorical buyout provisions of the school finance act require certain districts to offset or ""buy out"" state aid for categorical programs with local property tax revenue. This requirement applies to districts with very high property wealth. These districts can fund their total program, less minimum state aid and specific ownership taxes, with a levy less than the prior year's levy or a property tax change less than the sum of inflation plus the percentage change in enrollment. These districts must levy additional mills to pay for the categorical programs in their district. The categorical programs that are covered by these provisions include special education, the English Language Proficiency Act, transportation, vocational education, and small attendance centers. The additional levy for the categorical buyout cannot result in a levy that is greater than the prior year's or in property taxes that exceed the property tax revenue limit.         State Aid May Be Reduced in Certain Circumstances         State aid to school districts may be reduced if the General Assembly's original appropriation is insufficient or if a bill is passed to reduce the appropriation. In these instances, state aid would be reduced by a percentage of total program. Total program would be reduced by the same percentage in all districts, but no district would lose more state aid than it actually receives.             EARMARKED REVENUE       There are four provisions in the school finance act that require districts to earmark revenue for specific purposes. All other moneys under the school finance act are spent at districts' discretion.       Districts Must Earmark Money for Instructional Supplies, Materials, and Capital Outlay       For FY 2002-03, each district must budget $161 per pupil for items such as supplies, textbooks, library books, and periodicals. Districts can also use the money to acquire fixed assets for instruction, to transport pupils to school-sponsored instructional activities, and to repair or maintain instructional equipment. On-line students are not included in the count when calculating the amount to be budgeted. Each year, the per pupil allocation is increased by the same percentage as the statewide base per pupil amount.       Districts Must Earmark Money for Capital Reserve and Risk Management   Districts must allocate at least $262 per pupil in FY 2002-03 to a capital reserve fund or a risk management fund. Once again, on-line students are not included in the count when determining the amount to be allocated. Districts may allocate the $262 to the two funds as they wish, and transfers between the funds are permitted. The law caps the total amount that may be transferred in any year at $800 per pupil. Capital reserve moneys may be used to acquire land or improvements, construct buildings or additions, renovate buildings when the cost exceeds $2,500, purchase school buses or other equipment when the per unit cost is greater than $1,000, or pay for software licensing that costs more than $1,000. Risk management moneys are used to pay for insurance or to repair or replace school district property that has been damaged.   Just as with the allocation for instructional supplies, the per pupil allocation for capital reserve and risk management is increased each year by the same percentage as the statewide base per pupil amount. The mandatory per pupil allocation for capital reserve/risk management does not apply to any district that has a balance in its capital reserve fund of at least five times the required minimum transfer.       Districts Must Earmark a Portion of At-Risk Moneys       Districts are required to allocate a portion of the at-risk moneys they receive for specific purposes, and the purpose and amount depends on the source of the money. Seventy-five percent of at-risk moneys received from the count of students who are eligible for free lunch must be allocated for instructional programs or staff development efforts that relate directly to at-risk pupils. Districts must allocate all of the at-risk money generated by students with limited English skills to English language proficiency programs.       Districts Must Earmark All Preschool Moneys       Money received by a district for the Colorado Preschool Program must be allocated to the district's preschool program fund. The amount that must be allocated is determined by multiplying the preschool count by the district's per pupil operating revenues. Money in the fund can be spent on teacher and paraprofessional salaries and benefits, contracting for preschool services, supplies and materials, home visits, professional development, and a reasonable portion of district overhead costs.             UNEQUALIZED LOCAL REVENUE       The bulk of school district revenues are equalized, meaning that the state provides funding to equalize property wealth or ""level the playing field."" However, the school finance act also allows local school districts some discretion to raise additional local revenue, for which the state provides no equalization. These unequalized local revenue sources are described below.       School Districts May Raise Additional Property Taxes for Operating Purposes   The act allows districts to raise and spend additional property taxes, with voter approval, in excess of the amount authorized by the state's funding formula. These additional property taxes are called overrides. The act limits overrides to 20 percent of a district's total program or $200,000, whichever is greater, plus the 2001-02 supplemental cost-of-living adjustment amount. The total dollar amount approved by voters remains the same unless additional funding is approved at a subsequent election. The supplement cost-of-living amount is a fixed amount based on a calculation using the 2001-02 budget year.   The school finance act counts other revenue sources against a district's override limit. These other sources of revenue may limit a district's ability to request voter approval for a property tax increase equal to the full 20 percent limit. For example, specific ownership taxes that a district collects because of its override mill levy are counted against the limit, as are specific ownership taxes from a bond levy when the proceeds of the bond levy are not used to pay off the debt. In addition, the override for 34 districts also includes approximately $20.9 million in property taxes relating to the act's former hold harmless provisions. This funding was designed to hold districts harmless from any decrease in per pupil funding resulting from the passage of the 1994 act. In one district, the funding was derived from a higher-than-average mill levy.   In FY 2001-02, 50 school districts collected $247.3 million in voter-approved property taxes. Since some districts are phasing in their overrides, the amount of taxes collected was somewhat less than the amount authorized by voters.   Unequalized District Property Taxes also Pay for Debt     Independent of the school finance act, state law permits school districts to request voter approval to incur debt by issuing bonds. This is known as bonded debt. Districts repay the debt with a dedicated mill levy. Bonded debt is generally used by school districts for major capital construction projects. Revenue collected from a bonded debt mill levy must be credited to the district's bond redemption fund and used to repay the bondholders.   State law imposes a limit on the amount of bonded debt a school district may incur. Districts are prohibited from issuing bonded debt in excess of 20 percent of the district's assessed valuation or 6 percent of actual value, whichever is greater. For districts that meet specified increasing enrollment criteria and have debt elections approved between July 1, 1994, and July 1, 2005, the limit is the greater of 25 percent of assessed value or 6 percent of actual value.   ""Growth"" Districts May Raise Additional Property Taxes for Capital Improvements     Beginning in budget year 2002-03, growth districts can request voter approval to levy additional property taxes for capital projects. The money must be deposited into the district's capital reserve fund and can be used to pay for capital projects outright or to repay loans from the Public School Fund or the Colorado Educational and Cultural Facilities Authority. Growth districts are districts whose February enrollment count grows by at least 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the October count.   The additional mill levy for growth districts is based on a district's property wealth relative to the statewide average. A district with an assessed value per pupil that exceeds the statewide average may impose an additional levy up to 1 mill. The maximum levy increases as district property wealth decreases below the state average, up to the maximum of 5 mills. For instance, a district with an assessed value per pupil of $266,666 could impose a maximum of 1 mill when the statewide average assessed value per pupil is $83,000. A district with an assessed value of $16,600 could impose 5 mills, while a district with an assessed value per pupil of $33,200 could impose 2.5 mills.                     Growth District Mill Levy (5 Mill Maximum) = Average       Statewide Assessed Value Per Pupil ÷ Growth District Assessed Value Per       Pupil           Voters Must Approve Transportation Levies or Fees       Although not part of the school finance act, state law permits school districts to request voter approval to impose a levy or fee to pay for transportation costs not reimbursed by the state. The proceeds from this levy or fee must be deposited in the district's transportation fund.       Voters Can Also Approve Special Building or Technology Levies       School districts can also request voter approval of up to ten mills for up to three years to maintain and construct schools or to purchase and install instructional technology. The proceeds from such a levy must be deposited in the special building and technology fund.             CASH FLOW LOAN PROGRAM       School districts may participate in an interest-free cash flow loan program sponsored by the state. The state General Fund is the source of revenue for the loan program, which was created to help districts deal with the fact that property tax collections occur late in the budget year. A school district applies to the state treasurer for a loan. The loan is provided if the district meets the eligibility criteria in law. A district is eligible for a loan from the state in any month in which the district can demonstrate that a cash deficit will exist in its general fund. All loans must be repaid by June 25 of the state fiscal year in which the loan was made. A loan may not be made to provide assistance for matters eligible for payment from the contingency reserve or to cover a foreseeable level of uncollectible property taxes, nor may a loan be used by a district for arbitrage.             STATE CONTINGENCY RESERVE   State law requires the General Assembly to annually appropriate moneys to a contingency reserve fund to provide supplemental assistance to school districts. In FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $900,000 for this purpose. Moneys in the fund can be allocated by the State Board of Education to school districts for certain types of financial emergencies. Moneys are also available if a district's abatement levy is insufficient; if children placed in the district by a court create an unusual financial burden; to offset the impact of a decline in enrollment resulting from a detachment and annexation; or to offset the cost of pupils moving to a district after the count date. This last option is only available for districts under 2,000 pupils and only for the cost of the additional pupils.   In cases of extreme emergency, the state board may consider factors that are not specifically delineated in law and may provide financial aid from the contingency reserve to districts that could not maintain their schools without such additional assistance. In determining which districts receive payments from the contingency reserve and the amount of the payment, the state board must consider the amount of assistance requested as a percentage of each district's total program.             CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION       In addition to issuing bonds, school districts can request state assistance for some capital construction projects. Depending on the type of project and the school district’s circumstances, the state may provide assistance as a grant, a matching grant, or a loan.       The School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve Provides Grants to School Districts   The State Board of Education may distribute money from the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve only for capital expenditures that address immediate safety hazards or health concerns within existing school facilities, that relieve excessive operating costs created by insufficient maintenance or construction spending, or that relieve building construction conditions that detract from an effective learning environment. Any money in the reserve that is not spent by March 15 of each fiscal year is transferred to the School Construction and Renovation Fund. Over the 11-year period from FY 2000-01 through FY 2010-11, $105 million dollars is scheduled to be appropriated to the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve from the General Fund ($5 million the first year, $10 million per year thereafter). Appropriations for the first two fiscal years (FY 2000-01 and FY 2001-02) were made from the General Fund. However, General Fund appropriations are only to be made if excess General Fund revenues, after satisfying required obligations, exceed $80 million. Excess General Fund reserves were not available for FY 2002-03. Instead the appropriation was made from the State Education Fund.   Beginning in FY 2001-02, the reserve was also to receive the same amount of money that is appropriated for charter school capital construction. For FY 2001-02, $16.5 million was appropriated to the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve; $6.5 million of that amount was the charter school capital construction match. The requirement that the reserve receive this match was suspended for FY 2002-03 and is to be restored for FY 2003-04.   The School Construction and Renovation Fund Provides Matching Grants to School Districts   The School Construction and Renovation Fund provides matching grant money to school districts for instructional facilities, such as classrooms, libraries, physical plants, and associated administrative areas. The state board determines the proportion of state and local funds to finance each project and prioritizes projects based on criteria in law. The state board submits a prioritized list to the Capital Development Committee, who determines the number of projects to be funded and forwards a list of those projects to the Joint Budget Committee so that an appropriation can be included in the long appropriations bill.   Over a nine-year period from FY 2002-03 through FY 2010-11, $85 million dollars is scheduled to be appropriated to the School Construction and Renovation Fund from the General Fund. The first appropriation for FY 2002-03 was made from the State Education Fund and lottery proceeds because excess General Fund revenues were not sufficient to make this appropriation. Beginning in FY 2000-01, the fund could also receive unspent money from the School Capital Construction Expenditures Reserve.   The Permanent School Fund Provides Loans for School Districts       The State Treasurer can loan money to school districts from the Public School Fund for construction involving instructional facilities. As with the matching grants from the School Construction and Renovation Fund, any project for which a loan is sought must be on the prioritized list prepared by the state board. The state board also determines the amount of the loan. To obtain a loan, the voters of a school district are required to approve the debt and, if the loan is to be repaid from property taxes, the additional mill levy. The State Treasurer determines the amount of the fund that may be loaned out and the interest rate on any loans, which cannot be less than the rate of inflation.       The Contingency Reserve Could Provide Money for Safety Hazards or Health Concerns       Beginning in FY 2001-02, any lottery money that exceeds the cap and would have otherwise been transferred to the state General Fund is now transferred to the contingency reserve for school district capital expenditures. The state board may award this money to address immediate safety hazards or health concerns within existing school facilities. FY 2002-03 is the first year lottery moneys are expected exceed the cap at an estimated $8.5 million. However, for FY 2002-03 only, $4.1 million of this amount is not to remain in the contingency reserve and is instead transferred from the contingency reserve to the Capital Construction and Renovation Fund. This leaves $4.4 million of lottery revenues in the contingency reserve.             CALCULATION EXAMPLES     The following tables are provided for two purposes. First, to help illustrate the calculations included in the formula. Second, to provide data on how to determine the factors used in the formula.

Local share includes general fund property taxes and specific ownership tax revenue. Categorical buyout property taxes are subtracted from the local share; carry forward taxes are added. Other local revenue, such as override or bonded debt property taxes, are excluded.   2. The state share includes state equalization less any recisions. For FY 1993-94, state share includes funding for state equalization, increasing enrollment, and the provisions of House Bill 93-1320.   3. Figures are estimates based on House Bill 00-1159.               SPECIFIC-PURPOSE PROGRAMS       School districts in Colorado receive state revenue through a variety of programs designed to serve special groups of students or student needs. This section groups these programs into three categories and briefly describes the funding formulas for each. The three categories of programs are categorical programs, grant programs and other distributions, and programs funded through the school finance act.             CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS       Article IX, Section 17 of the Colorado Constitution, commonly referred to as Amendment 23, defines categorical programs as transportation programs, English language proficiency programs, expelled and at-risk programs, special education programs including gifted and talented programs, suspended student programs, vocational education programs, small attendance centers, comprehensive health education programs, and any other accountable program specifically identified in law as a categorical program. The General Assembly is required to increase total funding for all of these programs by the rate of inflation plus an additional percentage point through FY 2010-11 and by the rate of inflation thereafter. The General Assembly may use money in the State Education Fund to provide the increased funding. The state appropriation figures in the descriptive paragraphs below include General Fund and State Education Fund appropriations.             Special Education       The state provides special education funding for disabled students as well as for gifted and talented students. The Exceptional Children's Educational Act (ECEA) dictates how funding is distributed.       The State Provides $81.1 Million in Funding for Disabled Students   State funding for the education of disabled students totals $81.1 million in FY 2002-03. These funds are used to provide special services to 78,334 Colorado public school students with disabilities in FY 2002-03, or roughly 10.9 percent of total pupil membership.   Most funding to educate students with disabilities is distributed to administrative units. An administrative unit could be a school district, a board of cooperative services, or a combination of school districts. Under the law, roughly $49.8 million is distributed to administrative units in proportion to the amount distributed in FY 1994-95. Another $30.8 million is distributed directly to school districts based on the number of special education students in the district relative to the total number of such students statewide. The remaining $500,000 is earmarked for administrative units that pay tuition to facilities to provide special education services to students whose parents cannot be located or are incarcerated or whose parental rights have been relinquished or terminated.       The State Provides Funding for Programs to Serve Gifted and Talented Students       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $6.1 million for district gifted and talented programs. This money is used to provide staff, activities, and educational materials and equipment to serve gifted students.             Public School Transportation   School districts are reimbursed for some of the cost of transporting pupils between their home and school. The reimbursement formula is two-pronged: it takes into account mileage and excess costs. The formula provides 37.87 cents for each mile traveled, plus 33.87 percent of the difference between the district's current operating expenditures and the mileage allowance. ""Current operating expenditures"" includes items such as motor fuel and oil, vehicle maintenance costs, equipment, facilities, driver employment costs, and insurance. Districts are not eligible for reimbursement for the cost of purchasing buses or for field trips.   The law guarantees that no district will receive less in any given year than it was entitled to receive in the prior year. However, the law also applies a cap of 90 percent of district current operating expenditures. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $40.2 million for the transportation program. Each district's funding is prorated if the appropriation is less than the required amount.             Vocational Education   Unlike the school finance act and the other specific-purpose programs discussed in this booklet, which are administered by the Colorado Department of Education, the vocational education program is administered by the State Board for Community Colleges and Occupational Education. Vocational education courses are designed to provide students with entry-level occupational skills and knowledge required by business and industry. Any school district conducting approved vocational education courses is entitled to funding from moneys appropriated by the General Assembly.   Vocational education aid is disbursed to districts according to the full-time equivalent (FTE) cost of a program. The state provides funding for instructional personnel, contracted educational services, books and supplies, and equipment. Each district is required to pay its program costs per FTE at 70 percent of its per pupil operating revenue (school finance act revenue per pupil minus $262). For costs exceeding 70 percent, the state pays 80 percent of the first $1,250 per FTE and 50 percent of any additional costs above the initial $1,250 level. If the state appropriation is less than the amount required by the funding formula, district allocations are prorated. The FY 2002-03 appropriation for this program is $19.4 million.             English Language Proficiency       The English Language Proficiency Act (ELPA) provides financial assistance to districts with students whose dominant language is not English. Districts are required to identify, assess, and provide programs for students in the following classifications:       (a) students who do not comprehend or speak any English;     (b) students who comprehend or speak some English but whose predominant   language is not English; and     (c) students who comprehend and speak English and at least one other   language, whose dominant language is difficult to determine, and who score at   or below average on state or national tests or below an acceptable level on a   state-developed test.     ELPA funding is disbursed to districts for up to two years for each participating student. The state appropriation for this program for FY 2002-03 is $3.5 million. About $2.8 million of this appropriation is distributed to districts with students in categories (a) and (b). The remainder is distributed to districts with students in category (c). The amount of money each district receives is calculated by dividing students in categories (a) and (b) and students in category (c) by the respective portions of the appropriation.             Small Attendance Centers       The state provides additional funding for school districts that operate small attendance centers, which are defined as schools with less than 200 pupils that are at least 20 miles from a similar school in the same district. Eligible districts receive 35 percent of the difference between the district's per pupil funding and the per pupil funding the school would have received if it was a separate school district. A smoothing factor phases out funding for schools with more than 200 pupils. The General Assembly appropriated $880,600 for this program in FY 2002-03. Last year, funding was distributed to 13 schools in 10 districts across the state.             Expelled and At-risk Student and In-school and In-home Suspension Grant Programs       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $6.1 million to the Department of Education to distribute as grants for programs to serve expelled and at-risk students and for in-school and in-home suspension programs. Beginning in FY  2002-03 the expelled/at-risk funding was consolidated with the in-school and in-home suspension grant programs. Funding was combined to allow the school districts to serve both currently suspended/expelled students and those at-risk for suspension.   Funding for Expelled and At-risk Student Programs     The department may distribute money to school districts, charter schools, public alternative schools, non-parochial private schools whose programs have been approved by the state board, boards of cooperative services, and pilot schools under contract with the state board to serve expelled and at-risk students.   In awarding grants, the state board must consider, among other issues, the quality and cost-effectiveness of the services to be provided, the demonstrated effectiveness of services funded by previous grants to an applicant, and the number of students receiving services. Forty-five percent of the appropriation must be awarded to applicants who provide services to students from more than one school district.    Funding for In-school and In-home Suspension Grants     Public schools, or any public or private agency operating in conjunction with a public school, are eligible to receive grants to provide programs to students who are suspended from participation in regular school activities but who continue to receive instruction either at home or at school. Any single grant cannot exceed $25,000 per year, and grants are provided for a two-year period. By law, the total amount of grants in any one year is limited to $500,000.             Comprehensive Health Education       School districts and boards of cooperative services can receive grants to provide a local comprehensive health education program, a component of which must be a law-related education program to reduce the incidence of gang involvement and substance abuse. The grant program receives 50 percent of moneys appropriated but not spent for school finance, although the money must be appropriated by the General Assembly. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $600,000.             GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS       In addition to the categorical programs delineated in the state constitution, the state distributes aid to school districts for a variety of other programs. Some of these programs are grant programs whereby school districts or schools who meet eligibility criteria apply for the available money. For other programs, money is distributed by formula, either to all districts or to qualifying districts. The following paragraphs briefly describe these programs.               Read to Achieve         Schools may apply for grants to fund intensive reading programs for second and third grade pupils and pupils between the third and fourth grades whose literacy and reading skills are below grade level. Grants may be awarded for programs such as reading academies, after school literacy programs, summer school clinics, one-on-one or group tutoring services, and extended-day reading programs. The number of second and third grade pupils reading below grade level, the proven success of a proposed reading program, and the per pupil cost of a program are among the factors taken into account in selecting grant recipients. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $19.0 million for read-to-achieve grants from the Tobacco Litigation Settlement Cash Fund.             Summer School Grant Program       Districts may apply to the Department of Education for funding under the summer school grant program, and each applying district receives $100 for each student enrolled in the program. Summer school reading programs must be designed to provide intensive literacy and reading comprehension education services to students who have scored at the unsatisfactory proficiency level on the third or fourth grade reading CSAP. For FY 2002-03, $945,800 is appropriated from the State Education Fund for this program.       Facility Summer School Grant Program     Beginning in budget year 2002-03, schools operated by residential child care facilities or residential treatment centers may apply to the Department of Education for grants to provide summer school for children residing in their facilities. In awarding the grants, the Department of Education is to attempt to grant awards throughout the state to schools whose curricula is research-based and that have demonstrated success in improving the academic performance of students performing below grade level in reading, writing, mathematics, and science. The General Assembly appropriated $500,000 from the State Education Fund for the program in FY 2002-03.                 State Match for National School Lunch Act       For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $2.5 million to provide the match that the federal government requires to receive funding under the National School Lunch Act. The money provided by the state can be used only for the school lunch program and cannot supplant any money currently provided by a school district from its general fund.     School Breakfast Program       Beginning in budget year 2002-03, low performing or unsatisfactory schools can receive funding for breakfast programs. Moneys are to be used by school districts participating in the federal National School Lunch Act or Child Nutrition Act to create, enhance, or expand an existing program. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $500,000 for this program and must appropriate a minimum of $500,000 each year thereafter.          School Improvement Grants         The school improvement grant program provides money to schools rated as ""unsatisfactory"" to implement school improvement plans. It provides two-year grants of $75,000 for elementary schools, $100,000 for middle or junior high schools, and $125,000 for high schools. Receipt of a grant is contingent upon the local board submitting a school improvement plan to the State Board of Education. Under the program, a school receives an additional $25,000 in the second year of the program if it improves by at least half a point from the standard deviation over the preceding year's total score. The General Assembly appropriated $2.8 million from the State Education Fund for the program in FY 2002-03. This two-year program expires July 1, 2003.       Increasing Enrollment Aid       Beginning in budget year 2002-03, school districts experiencing enrollment growth during the school year may receive additional funding. To qualify for the additional aid, a school district’s pupil enrollment growth for the current budget year and the two preceding budget years must increase by an average of at least 9 percent each year. After meeting the 9 percent criterion, school districts may receive funding for each pupil of increase greater than 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, from October to February. The amount of funding is equal to five-twelfths of the district’s per pupil operating revenue (PPOR). Districts seeking increasing enrollment aid must take a February 1 enrollment count. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $260,354 for increasing enrollment aid; three districts are estimated to qualify for the additional aid.               Charter School Capital Construction         The General Assembly appropriated $7.8 million from the State Education Fund for charter school capital construction in FY 2002-03. A charter school qualifies for money if it will receive funding from a district for the budget year. The amount that each charter school receives is equal to the total funding from the State Education Fund multiplied by each charter school's percentage of total pupils statewide enrolled in eligible charter schools. Funding from the State Education Fund for charter school capital construction is to increase annually, through FY 2011-12, by the rate of inflation plus one percentage point. Thereafter, it is to increase by the rate of inflation.               Purchase of New Textbooks         The General Assembly appropriated $15 million from the State Education Fund for FY 2002-03 to distribute to school districts to purchase new textbooks. Each district received $21 per student. In FY 2001-02 school districts received $14.1 million for this purpose based on $20 per student. Each school district is required to adopt a plan on the use of the money; moneys must first be used to provide up-to-date textbooks in reading, writing, math, science.             Teacher Pay Incentives         The teacher pay incentive program is a four-year grant program for teachers at public schools that receive an academic performance rating of ""unsatisfactory."" The grant money can only be used to provide bonuses (or associated costs) to reward outstanding performance, recruit or retain teachers, or defray housing costs. The program provides additional money to schools that receive a ""significant improvement"" or ""improvement"" rating after the first year of the four-year program. Both the basic grant money and the additional money are allocated to schools on a per pupil basis by dividing the appropriation by the total number of students enrolled in all eligible schools. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $4.2 million from the State Education Fund for this program. Schools which qualified as an eligible school in FY 2001-02, but no longer qualify (low performing schools) only receive funding for the 2001-02 school year. This program expires July 1, 2005.               Science and Technology Education Center Grants         The science and technology education center grant program provides development and operating moneys to nonprofit science and technology education centers that provide science and technology education activities, materials, and educational workshops for students and their teachers. The amount of a grant under this program is limited to $500,000 for a new center and $200,000 for an operating center. Any center that receives a grant is required to match the amount of a state grant. For FY 2002-03, the General Assembly appropriated $372,000 for this program, which expires July 1, 2011.               PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH THE FINANCE ACT         Two programs are created for a discrete group of students; however, funding for the programs is allocated through the school finance act. Students are counted under the act and therefore receive the district per pupil funding allocation for each pupil. The two programs are the Colorado Preschool Program and full-day kindergarten for at-risk youngsters.               Colorado Preschool Program     The Colorado Preschool Program, which has been in operation since 1989, serves children aged three to five years who lack overall learning readiness, who are in need of language development, or who participate in state programs for neglected or dependent children. A school district may provide the program itself, or contract with a Head Start or local child care agency to provide all or a portion of the program. School districts must meet specific state requirements regarding class size, parental involvement, and teacher training and planning to participate in the program.   The Colorado Preschool Program is funded through the school finance act. Children participating in the program are counted as half-day pupils. Current law limits the number of children that may participate in the program to 11,050. In FY 2002-03, nearly $32.8 million of school finance total program is attributable to this particular program. Of the 11,050 slots, 1,500 are reserved for full-day kindergarten. School districts must deposit revenue received for these children in the district preschool program fund.               Full-day Kindergarten         School districts may offer and receive funding for full-day kindergarten programs for students who attend a school that received an academic performance rating of ""unsatisfactory"" for the previous school year. A school district can provide the program itself or contract with other private or public entities to provide the program. In FY 2002-03, nearly $3.8 million of school finance total program is attributable to this program. The authorization for this program ends July 1, 2006.             GLOSSARY       Amendment 23 :   A   constitutional amendment adopted in 2000 that sets minimum levels of increase   in the statewide base per pupil funding amount and in categorical program   funding and sets a minimum increase in the state General Fund appropriation   for school finance. It also creates the State Education Fund and earmarks a   portion of income tax revenue for the fund. Amendment 23 is codified as   Article IX, Section 17, Colorado Constitution.         Assessed Value:   The taxable value of   property as determined by a tax assessor or government agency. Property taxes   are paid on the basis of a property's assessed valuation, which represents   only a fraction of a property's market value. (See p. 10)         At-Risk Pupils:  Students who are eligible for the federal free lunch   program because they come from families with incomes below a certain level or   who have limited English skills and meet other criteria relating to CSAP   tests. The act provides additional funding based on the number of at-risk   pupils enrolled in each district. (See pp. 7, 28)         At-Risk Factor:  A factor used to compute the additional amount of   funding a district receives for its at-risk pupils. Each district starts with   an at-risk factor of 11.5 percent. Districts with more than the statewide   average proportion of at-risk pupils receive an at-risk factor of 11.5 percent   plus three-tenths of one percentage point—0.36 percentage point for a   district with a pupil count greater than 50,000—for every percentage point   that the district's proportion exceeds the statewide average, up to 30   percent. (See pp. 8,28)         Base Funding Amount:   See Statewide Base Per Pupil Funding Amount.   (See p. 3)         Bonded Indebtedness:  Obligations of a school district to make payments   on a loan, generally for major capital construction projects. With voter   approval, districts can issue bonded debt and impose a mill levy to repay the   debt over time. (See p. 3)         Budget Year:  Same as a fiscal year, the period beginning   on July 1 of each year and ending on the following June 30.         Capital Outlay:  Money spent to acquire fixed assets which can be   expected to last for more than one year. Fixed assets include land, buildings,   machinery, and furniture.         Capital Reserve Fund : A fund used by school districts for long-term   capital outlay expenditures. Districts can only use the capital reserve fund   to acquire land and buildings, construct new buildings or additions to   buildings, purchase equipment and furnishings, alter or improve existing   buildings when the cost exceeds $2,500, acquire school buses or other   equipment with a per unit cost of at least $1,000, enter into long-term lease   agreements, or purchase software licenses that cost at least $1,000. Districts   must allocate a minimum of $262 per pupil between the capital reserve fund or   a risk management fund in FY 2002-03, unless they have at least five-years’   worth of transfers already in the fund. (See p. 17)         Categorical Programs:  Specific-purpose programs that are funded   separately from a district's total program funding under the school finance   act and are identified in the state constitution. Examples include vocational   education, special education, and transportation. (See pp. 15, 31)         Charter School:  A public school which operates under contract with a   public school district.         Constitutional Spending Limit:  The maximum allowable change in a school   district's spending from one year to the next. The limit for school districts   is equal to the percentage change in a district's enrollment plus the   Denver-Boulder inflation rate in the prior calendar year.   (See pp. 11, 15)         Cost-of-Living Factor:  One of the three main factors used in   calculating a district's per pupil funding. The cost-of-living factor reflects   the relative differences among the state's 178 districts in the costs of   housing, goods, and services for the regions in which districts are located.   (See pp. 4, 26)         District Per Pupil Funding:  The amount that results from combining the   statewide base with the components of the formula. A district's per pupil   funding is multiplied by its pupil count to determine funding, before   accounting for on-line and at-risk students. (See pp. 3, 26)         Enrollment:  The number of pupils enrolled on October 1 within the   budget year .  (See p. 2)         Equalization Aid:   State funding provided to equalize the property   wealth of districts. (See p. 12)         Growth Districts:  School districts whose February enrollment count   grows by at least 1 percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the   October count. Growth districts can request voter approval to levy additional   property taxes for capital projects. (See p. 20)         Hold Harmless District:  A district whose formula per pupil funding in   the first year of the 1994 school finance act would have declined from the   prior year's level. (See p. 19)         Increasing Enrollment Districts:  School districts whose pupil   enrollment for the current budget year and the two preceding budget years   increases by an average of 9 percent each year. These districts are eligible   for additional aid if their February enrollment count grows by at least 1   percent or 50 students, whichever is less, over the October count. (See p. 39)         Local Share:  The portion of a district's total program contributed   directly by local taxpayers of the district. A district's local share includes   revenue from property taxes and specific ownership taxes. (See p. 10)         Maximum Increase in Per Pupil Funding:  The statutory cap which limits   annual increases in per pupil funding to 25 percent. (See p. 15)         Mill Levy:  A property tax rate based on dollars per thousand of   assessed valuation.  One mill is the same as one tenth of one percent   (.001). Thus, one mill will generate $1 when levied on $1,000 of a property's   assessed value. (See p. 10)         Minimum Per Pupil Funding:   A minimum funding level guaranteed to   each district. In FY 2002-03, the law guarantees $5,435 per pupil.   (See p. 14)         Minimum State Aid District:  A district that can pay for its entire   total program from local property and specific ownership taxes and, thus, only   receives the minimum amount of state aid per pupil. For FY 2002-03, each   district in the state receives at least $73.40 per pupil. (See p. 12)         Nonpersonnel Costs Factor:  A percentage representing   the difference between 100 percent and a district's personnel costs   factor. (See p. 5)        On-line students:  Students enrolled in an on-line education program  that   provides sequential program instruction to educate a child who resides in   Colorado through services accessible on the world wide web and monitored by a   district coordinator and a site coordinator; except that, if an on-line   program is provided by a charter school, the site coordinator has sole   responsibility for monitoring the program.  (See pp. 9, 29)         Override:  Local voter-approved property tax revenue in excess of total   program as defined under the act. (See  p .19)         Personnel Costs Factor:  One of the three main factors used in   calculating a district's per pupil funding. The personnel costs factor is a   percentage which represents the estimated portion of a district's budget which   is attributed to personnel costs. It is formula-driven and differs by district   based on enrollment. (See pp. 5, 27)         Per Pupil Funding:  The amount that results from combining the statewide   base with the components of the formula. A district's per pupil funding is   multiplied by its pupil count to determine funding, before accounting for   on-line and at-risk students. (See pp. 3, 26)         Per Pupil Operating Revenues/PPOR:  A district's total program divided   by its funded pupil count, minus the minimum amount per pupil required to be   transferred for the capital reserve fund or a risk management fund. In   FY 2002-03, a district's PPOR is its total per pupil funding minus $262.         Property Tax:  A local tax that is calculated by applying a   mill levy to assessed value. Revenue from the property   tax represents the primary source of local funding for K-12 public   education. (See p. 10)         Pupil Count/Funded Pupil Count:  The number of pupils for which a school   district receives funding under the school finance act. For funding purposes,   pupils are counted on October 1 within the applicable budget year.   (See p. 2)         Size Factor:  One of the three main factors used in calculating a   district's per pupil funding. The size factor is designed to compensate   districts for the cost pressures of economies of scale. It is   formula-driven and based on enrollment. (See pp. 5, 27)         Specific Ownership Tax:  A tax paid annually on motor vehicles instead   of property taxes. Specific ownership taxes are part of a district's local   contribution to school funding. (See p. 11)         Small Attendance Center:  A school of less than 200 students that is   located more than 20 miles from a similar school in the same district.

This enrollment drop has had a major financial impact upon the General State aid that the district receives. As a result the district made cuts totaling $126,726 in the spring of 01, $150,000 in the spring of 02 and will make cuts of $220,000 in the spring of 03.

Voters of the district defeated a referendum for an education fund tax rate increase of $1.00 in the spring of 2002. The district issued $725,000 of working cash bonds in December 2003 which will help a projected $250,000 budget deficit for FY03 and assist with cash flow problems. Approximately $425,000 of program and personnel cuts will be made in the FY04 budget, which includes closing an elementary building. In April 2003 voters will be asked to approve a $.50 education fund tax rate increase. The district is projected to lose just under $1,000,000 of assessed value on the 2002 tax levy, which is payable in 2003. Student enrollment is expected to decline. It is anticipated that the FY04 budget will be balanced, however, the district could quickly be back into a deficit situation if there are unexpected increases in operational costs, and if promised state funding continues to come late and at less that 100%.

When a school district is heavily reliant on State Aid, regardless of whether that is caused by lack of local wealth or tax base, any manipulation of the level of State Aid has immediate and direct consequences to that district. Schools that are reliant on State Aid to meet their daily obligations are constantly challenged to maintain financial integrity. Many of the challenges we face stem from delays, prorated dollars, and/or missed payments altogether. The Mulberry Grove Community Unit Schools have been extremely diligent in the planning and implementation of the District's budget. There is no question that every effort is being made to wisely spend the limited resources that we have available to fund our educational programs. The community has supported a substantial levy, yet as you are well aware we are heavily reliant on State Aid to finance our total program. The Mulberry Grove Schools are facing the very same problems as so many others are faced with throughout our State. We are faced with the increasing pressure of financial, statutory, litigated, and otherwise mandated obligations at both the State and Federal levels. At the very same time, we are expected to deal with decreasing revenues and other resources to meet these obligations. It should be recognized that the biggest problem this district faces is one of cash flow, not over spending. Many measures have been put in place to address our local financial concerns. A great amount of daily attention and energy is spent in doing our very best in providing a quality education for our students. The fact is we are heavily reliant on State Aid in order to meet our financial obligations. The fact that the State itself has not met its obligations by funding mandates fully, and providing revenues in a timely manner that are not prorated has complicated matters significantly. There is no doubt that since we are so reliant on State Aid that fluctuations and arbitrary manipulations of financial formulas certainly affect our local financial picture dramatically. Regardless of what is or is not done to help with this situation, we will continue to serve the students and members of this community to the very best of our ability.

This district in conjunction with four other districts will be involved in a reorganization feasibility study this Spring. We are in a depressed area with the only hope of growth coming when the newly built prison opens. Taxpayers of Mt. Carroll CUD 304 have the highest school tax rate, 6.1282, in the counties of Carroll, Jo Davies and Stephenson. With an approximate unemployment rate of 10% in Carroll County, taxpayers of Mt. Carroll show responsibility for students in our District. The over reliance on property tax is not a responsible method to fund education. The state and its elected officials need to change the way Illinois schools are funded. School are not able to withstand the unpredictability of the distribution of state funds.

We have reduced 15% of the certified staff and 25% of the administrative staff through retirements. We are in the middle of a $7,500,000 project with revenues from the Capital Development Board and a bond referendum. The district has sought additional revenue sources and cuts have been made on expenditure line items. A sincere effort has been made to be cost effective. Carlyle school district has lost significant funds by a declining interest rate on investments, state and federal grants and reductions in state aid as EAV growth has minimally taken place along with increases in operating costs. Carlyle like many districts is on the financial early warning list. The Board of Education and administration will continue to seek ways to provide the best educational opportunities for students at the most reasonable cost.

The District committed deficit spending, depending on operating funds and existing fund balances, to meet debt retirement obligations. The District meets its Alternate Revenue Bond debt retirement obligation by transferring interest from the Education, Operations and Maintenance, and Working Cash Funds to the Bond & Interest Fund. The principal and interest obligation is expensed via the Bond & Interest Fund. This expense (approximately $3.3 million annually) is not included in the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio. If this expense were included the Expenditures to Revenue Ratio, the District would score 2 in this category for fiscal year 2001/02. Over the past three years, District 59 has lost over $8 million in anticipated revenue to pay property tax refunds issued through Cook County. The loss of property taxes due to refunds is causing the District to implement expenditure reductions and to seek revenue alternatives, such as a debt service extension base.

The more recent phenomenon of the significant increase in property tax refunds will result in an additional financial burden to the school district. This fiscal year to date, District 67 has lost $252,000 in property tax refunds. The majority of those refunds, $192,000, results from commercial business refunds from tax years 1995 and 1996. Beginning in 1998 through 2001, Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) objections may cause the District to lose an additional $1.01 million. There is no mechanism at this time to recover this revenue. The PTAB process has provided commercial and industrial property owners with an incentive to increase the volume of property assessment appeals. In summary, because of legislation that encourages commercial and industrial property owners to file assessment appeals, a greater financial burden is placed both on residential property owners as property tax payers and the school district as a taxing body.

The district sold fire prevention and life safety bonds to fund life safety improvements in the school district. Rhodes passed a referendum for .5500 in the education fund in 2002. This should bring in excess of $1,000,000 new dollars per year into the district. It should enable us to alleviate our deficit over the next two to more years.

This budget projects Operational Funds revenues at $37,186,784 with expenditures of $35,870,444. February 13, 2003, a copy of the 2002-03 school year budget was given to Lisa D. Maher, Regional Financial Consultant, for ISBE review. During the 2001-02 school year the previous administration expended $3,810,495.52 from the Site and Construction Fund for capital improvements in the district. $13,503,937.98 was expended from the O & M Fund. Expenditures for capital improvements were under estimated in the previous administrations 2001-01 budget.

Enrollment in the Westchester Public Schools has increased by 34% in the last 10 years. During this time, the district responded by utilizing bonds to renovate and reopen a previously closed facility, to renovate its schools to meet current educational needs, and to build additions to provide required handicapped accessibility and adequately house students in our district. The long term impact of tax caps has prompted District 92 1/2 to propose an April referendum to increase its education fund rate, set in 1929, in order to provide sufficient revenue to eliminate deficit spending. With the passage of an education fund referendum, District 92 1/2 will implement a plan to align revenues and expenditures for FY04, reducing educational programs as needed to maintain quality services within our budgetary limits.

In 1993, the district was successful in passing a referendum in the educational fund rate of .90 after 11 previously unsuccessful attempts to do so. During the years from 1982-1993, when we were unsuccessful in passing our referendum and with the decline in State Aid, our district cut programs, cut staff and closed two buildings in an attempt to stay financially solvent. With the passage of the referendum in 1993, it appeared that our district's financial troubles were a thing of the past. Little did we realize however, that tax caps were on their way and would have a major negative impact on the financial health of our district. Because of the tax cap, District 117 has lost over six million dollars in local revenue. We have never fully accessed our approved .90 increase. This is not fair. Our local voters gave us authority in 1993 to raise our educational tax rate. This is local control at its best. However, because of the imposition of the tax caps, my district is starting to see an erosion of our financial base and expenditures, surpassing our revenues. We have very few alternatives if we intend to maintain our programs. This month (Feb. 03) will focus on borrowing $8,665,000 in working cash bonds to help balance the budget. What does the State expect us to do when our borrowed money is gone? Although the State has made verbal commitment to increase educational funding, we have not seen increases in District 117. What we have seen are additional limitations such as the imposition of administration tax caps in the 2000/01 budget which have limited expenses in legislatively designed accounts to 5% increases and restricted grants covering only a portion of the costs for new programs. Tax caps for Cook County and limited State Aid have also made us apprehensive of promises of any increases in State funding of education. In addition, due to tax limitation laws, we are not able to access the increased EAV. What can the State do to help us? It is simple: Remove the tax cap immediately Allow districts to fully access increase in EAV Remove all utility expenses from the tax cap Remove life safety from under the tax cap Support EFAB's recommendations  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 14 of 85   County/District Name Max PALOS COMM CONS SCHOOL DIST 118 RIDGELAND SCHOOL DISTRICT 122 OAK LAWN-HOMETOWN SCH DIST 123 EVERGREEN PK ELEM SCH DIST 124 ATWOOD HEIGHTS DISTRICT 125 ALSIP-HAZLGRN-OAKLWN S DIST 126 WORTH SCHOOL DISTRICT 127  FBRR (1.4) 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.05 1.40 1.40  EXRV (1.4) 1.05 1.05 0.35 1.05 0.70 0.70 1.05  DCOH (0.4) 0.30 0.30 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.20 0.30  STB (0.4) 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  LTD (0.4) 0.40 0.10 0.20 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.10  Score (4.0) 3.55 3.25 2.45 3.25 2.65 3.10 3.25  Designation Financial Recognition Financial Review Financial Watch Financial Review Financial Early Warning Financial Review Financial Review  District Comments  Educational rate referendum ($.65) will be on April 1, 2003 ballot.

Over eleven million dollars in construction bonds were issued in Fiscal Year 2002. This impacted the district's remaining debt margin (one of the factors which comprises the ISBE financial profile score). The Board of Education and administration were notified in September, 2001, by the state's Capital Development Board, that the district is eligible for $5,758 million in state funds for this construction project. To date, the state has not yet released these critical funds. Late payments by the state for categorical reimbursement for eligible transportation and special education expenses also negatively affected Fiscal Year 2002 revenues. As of June 30, 2002, over $275,000 was vouchered by ISBE as due and payable to the district but not remitted on time. Indeed, the weak economy has created financial problems at the state level which are now impacting local schools reliant on promised state financial support. The district will continue to monitor expenditures while the state seeks an answer to its revenue shortfalls. The district remains confident that ultimately the construction project will achieve greater efficiency regarding lighting, heating and maintenance costs. Additionally, more evenly distributed class size in the elementary buildings should also be achievable with the reconfigured early childhood learning center and two elementary buildings. The district is committed to continuing to offer a quality educational program within the constraints imposed by property tax caps and weakened state support. The Board of Education recently adopted a resolution in favor of the Educational Funding Advisory Board (EFAB) plan for better and more equitable funding of schools.

During the 2001-2002 school year, Arbor Park School District 145 paid for airconditioning and new school buses from bond proceeds. These expenditures were matched with revenues from bond proceeds. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile did not take this into account.

They responded affirmatively and we are waiting for the State of Illinois to release the Construction Grant money so that we can break ground on construction. Prior to the 2001-2002 fiscal year, the district was without long-term debt. The 2001-2002 budget projection indicated that expenditures would grow beyond revenue for the first time in over five years. This was due almost entirely to an increase in staffing to match the needs of a growing enrollment. The community approved a second referendum for a $.60 increase in the education fund tax rate. We believe the districts response to its environment was both appropriate and timely and much more positive than the 2.80 profile would lead one to believe. A decrease in EAV is anticipated due to an onslaught of property tax appeal board cases coming from Cook County Commercial property taxpayers. Tax appeals as early as 1993-1996 have resulted in an unanticipated 12% reduction in 2001 tax collections. Notice of appeal was never required by law to be given to the affected taxing bodies, nor is there any relief provided under the current tax cap structure.

This caused a drastic change in our Expenditure to Revenue ratio. The difference between District 158's Financial profile designation for FY01 (financial review) and District 158's Financial profile as indicated on this preliminary report (financial watch) is not a true indicator of District 158's financial status. District 158 charges against the budget all salaries in the year they are earned. Some districts charge salaries only as they are paid. If we used an accrual accounting system we would charge the salaries as expenses and show an asset titled Prepaid Salaries. This is what actually happened. Salaries are paid in one fiscal year but checks are not issued until July and August in the next fiscal year. This diminished the cash on hand according to the financial records, yet the cash is still in the bank. This amounts to $970,173.56 for fiscal year 01/02.

During the 2000-01 school year the District sold $12,500,000 worth of Working Cash Fund bonds to fund a 5 year renovation project on the high school. During each of those years expenses for renovations appearing in the Operations and Maintenance Fund and have been and will be paid for with cooresponding revenue transfers to the O & M Fund from the Working Cash Fund. Since the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator excludes the Working Cash Fund and fund transfers, expenses for this type of project are recorded but the revenues are not. For FY 2002, reported here, $5,455,907 in expenses for the renovations to the facility were included in the Operations and Maintenance figures but the transfer from Working Cash for the same amount to pay for those renovations that is reflected in the District's Annual Financial Report FY2002 is not included as revenue to offset that expense. Consequently the District ratio for this indicator was incorrectly listed as 1.14. It should have been 1.05. The impact of this inaccuracy is that the District should have received an overall score of 3.55 instead of 3.2. This should have placed Evanston Township High School in the ""Financial Recognition"" category instead of the ""Financial Review"" category as listed in this document.

We used accumulated fund balances (savings) to build a new Center for the Arts at our junior high. This project was saved for and built without having to go to a referendum. Revised 3/12/03 During the period of time being considered, the Board of Education built a new Center for the Arts and a new Early Childhood/Administrative Center. The total cost of these one time expenditures was $7.5 million. The Board entered into a lease-purchase agreement and received $2.5 million which was not recognized as revenue in the State Board of Education's formulas. These projects were planned for and built utilizing fund balances without a referendum or tax rate increase.

The rev/exp ratio looks bad even though there are invested dollars earmarked for the expense. The one time receipt of the School Construction Grant assisted the district's revenues to expenditure ratio. The major reason that expenditures exceeded revenues in FY02 is that the school district completed paying for a 5.5 million dollar addition to our middle school from revenues accumulated in the previous two years and placed in the operations and maintenance fund. On March 19, 2002 District 2 passed a successful education fund rate increase of 80 cents. It was the first referendum passed in 34 years.

District to district comparisons are complicated by financial reporting cash or accrual accounting methods. Queen Bee School District 16 reports on an accrual basis. Therefore, fund balances include $1,200,000 of accrued salaries (summer payrolls) and accrued compensated days thereby reducing fund balances. Adding those dollars back into the fund balances would increase the district score to 1.05 from .70 in area 1 and increasing the total profile score from 2.55 to 2.9 which would move this district from the ""Financial Watch"" determination to the ""Financial Early Warning"" determination. 2. Every school district in Illinois has a different ""story"" of financial status that is reflected in the new Financial Profile. While we believe this evaluation better reflects a district's financial picture than the ""Financial Watch"" formula did, it is important to understand that unique circumstances can cause elevated or exceptionally dismal scores. For example, a deficit budget could reflect a construction project as we did in FY2001 when funds from a lease purchase were deposited in our Operations and Maintenance Fund in FY2000 and the costs incurred in FY2001. This would skew both step 2 and step 3 of the profile. 3. Percent of long-term debt margin remaining: The district has no non-referendum bond ability remaining even though there is 46.4% debt margin remaining for the district. Legislative action could make these funds available for an emergency (i.e. life safety). This district currently has $6,000,000 of approved life safety amendments it is unable to proceed with until funds become available. At this time it is not feasible to request funds via referendum. Please see statement #4. 4. The district has an education fund tax rate referendum question on the April 1, 2003 ballot after the defeat of the November 2, 2002 referendum. Should it not be successful, the district is preparing to implement $1,5000,000 in staff salary and benefit reductions. The last successful referendum was in 1993.

MAERCKER SCHOOL DISTRICT 60  1.40  1.05  0.30  0.40  0.10  3.25  Financial Review  Creating a financial profile of a school district is like trying to hit a moving target. This is because a district's cash balance changes daily with a continuous flow of revenue and expenses. Therefore, a certain point-in-time must be determined. In Illinois, that point-in-time is June 30. The establishment of any common date across Illinois is somewhat problematic in that different counties receive major tax deposits at different times of the year. Cook County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in October, while DuPage County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in June. One who analyzes a financial profile needs to understand this, as the financial health of a school district in DuPage County may appear healthier than school districts in other counties. Since Maercker District 60 does, in fact, receive major tax deposits each June, its financial health appears rosier than it may be when making statewide comparisons.

For FY02 our ranking dropped to Financial Watch List. The reason for the change can be accounted for in the scoring of the expenditure to revenue ratio. This is the only section of the five in which our scoring dropped from the previous year. In FY01 our score was a ""4"", in FY02 we dropped to a ""2"". The reason for the drop is attributed to nearly $8M of expenditures in the Operations & Maintenance Fund, which were construction related. We budgeted $5M for payout of construction work associated with a $52.5M project, which was only supported by a $25 referendum (and did not include equipment and furniture). A $7M State Construction Grant, operating funds and fund balances, offset the remaining $17.5M. Additionally, in FY02 we expended $3M for 36 portable classroom complexes at both of our high schools. In total we are doing $11M worth of work at our high schools (including portables), which is being paid for by an $11M Working Cash Bond Sale. The proceeds from this bond sale are not shown as revenue in FY02 even though the expenditures are included. While we still had a negative operating budget (not including the $11M), our ranking without the impact of construction would have only slipped to Financial Review not Financial Watch List.

Management of local (89%), state (8%) and federal (3%) funds at a ""break-even"" level has not had a negative impact on quality education at our local level. Minooka Community High School is predicted to experience sustained 5-6% growth in student population for the next 5 years. This will have a negative effect on our district financial profile without successful passage of Ed and building referendum.

This is especially true over the past three years. In 2000-2001 our Education Fund experienced a deficit of almost $435,000. Despite making cuts, we have continued to experience deficit spending. This year the situation was complicated by the loss of almost $140,000 in General State Aid and Corporate Personal Property Replacement Tax. Unit #9 entered the 20002001 school year with approximately $1,600,000 in savings in our Education and Working Cash Funds. We will end the 2002-2003 fiscal year with approximately $600,000. This projection assumes that the District will receive 24 General State Aid payments. There is much talk about school districts not receiving two General State Aid payments during this fiscal year. A loss of two General State Aid payments would mean an additional $265,000 loss to the District. This would be absolutely disastrous. At the present rate, we will expend all of our reserves during the 2004-2005 school year with limited capacity to raise additional revenue. The Board has instituted several cost controlling measures that reduced deficit spending by over $300,000 per year. The cost controlling measures are: Eliminated an administrative position Eliminated 5 certified positions Eliminated 4 non certified positions Closed an elementary school Reduced travel, supply and equipment budgets Many financial concerns exist for the 2003-2004 school year. There are concerns about possible reductions in State revenue and increases in maintenance costs, general personnel costs, insurance costs and special education costs. Unit #9 is heavily reliant on General State aid to meet operational expenses. Therefore, when the State cuts or freezes funding to schools it has a dramatic effect on our school district. To date, we have no solid information about what will happen with State funding, but the outlook appears to be bleak. Moreover, the Board has fully utilized the local tax levy by taxing at the maximum rates. The Board has also substantially increased the Tort Fund revenue to pay salaries for employees who are involved in risk management activities. This practice has increased the overall tax rate that our community is assessed. The Board is also extremely sensitive to the economic woes in our area. The unemployment rate in Watseka is approaching double digits as a number of factories have shut their doors over the past few months. This, in addition to a depressed farm economy, limits our community's ability to support schools with their tax dollars.

This means that the ISBE will be monitoring our school district closely and offering proactive technical assistance. Based on the information from ISBE management, there will be a large number of school districts on the state watch list. The ISBE estimates that 85% of school districts will be deficit spending by the end of this fiscal year. Based on conversation with other local school district administrators, our district is not alone in our financial woes. We project that the district's education fund could have a deficit fund balance of 1 million dollars by the end of the fiscal year. If the district continues to experience expenditures as we have in the past, we could reach a $5 million deficit by FY2005. Many factors have contributed to our school district's financial condition. Decreases in general state aid revenues ($382,000 decrease this year - could be more if 23rd and 24th State Aid payments are prorated or received late, as predicted) due to declining enrollment and a freeze in the funding foundation level, as well as proration of categorical grants by as much as 85% (i.e.. Special education and transportation) have had a large impact on district revenues. The district has also felt the effect of tax caps, which have limited the amount of property insurance premiums, which have nearly doubled, increasing costs by $150,000. Personnel costs have increased substantially due to significant salary increases over the past three years, although average salaries for teachers and administrators continue to fall below the state average. Personnel costs increased by over $300,000 in FY03. The State of Illinois is potentially faced with a $5 billion deficit. The district would like to attempt to cut 1/2 million dollars from our budget next year to help alleviate the situation. It appears that it could be at least 18 months before school districts get any relief through proposed income tax increases or other funding. Future considerations and concerns for our school district will be further decreases in state aid, tax caps, increased cost of health insurance, workman's compensation and property insurance and contract negotiations, variables which could cost the district an undeterminable amount of money. At present, the financial forecast for the State as well as the financial position of the district, in our opinion, creates the following conclusions: One way for the district to address our financial concerns will be through attrition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 39 of 85   County/District Name Max  FBRR (1.4)  EXRV (1.4)  DCOH (0.4)  STB (0.4)  LTD (0.4)  Score (4.0)  Designation  District Comments created by employee retirements district wide.

It is the intent of the district administration to address every aspect of the budget and with the next school year plan to provide a savings of approximately $500,000. It is with these conclusions that we present our proposal to begin finding ways to reduce our deficit spending issues. The specific recommendations will be made at the February meeting.

Numerous expenses were incurred during the final phase of construction and moving into the new facility, which is the primary reason the expenditure to revenue ratio was greater than 1 for FY02. These were planned expenses for which money had been saved. Because the reorganization expenses were included in FY02, the expenditures were inflated to $15,147,886. With the exception of summer projects completed in FY03, the expenditures will be back to a more realistic number for FY03 ($12,395,652). The School Board of Education and Administration are working diligently to operate within a balanced budget. However, with delayed payments from the State and Federal governments and an overall reduction in school revenue, this will be a challenge.

The recommendation to build was substantiated by a successful referendum granting permission to build and to sell bonds for that purpose. Bourbonnais ranks fourth on the most recent priority ranking from the CDB for school construction funds. Significant repairs and associated costs are continuing for the other five Bourbonnais schools. The current method of calculating the School District Financial Profile fails to include the ""Sale of Fixed Assets"" as revenue. Each year the District replaces its bus fleet. In 2001-02, $383,037 was received in revenue as trade-in for eight buses and $446,344 was expended. Total Transportation Fund revenue including the trade-in receipts was $727,490.94 and expenditures were $694,271.19 or a positive $33,219.75 of revenue over expenditures. The ISBE data indicates receipts of $344,453,46 and expenditures of $694,271.19 or a deficit $349,817.73 of expenditures over revenue. The ISBE method of calculating the ""Expenditure to Revenue Ratio"" does not accurately convey the actual totals which are total revenues of $10,209,323 (not $9,826,286) and expenditures of $9,901,365, resulting in a ratio of .97 not 1.01. The other major item, besides salary and benefit personnel costs, that may negatively affect our financial position, is the State's funding of education. Flat or decreased overall funding by the State will lead to significant erosion of our financial position and the need to further cut programs and services to remain financially solvent. The State must adequately and equitably fund public education!

District 88 will be asking voters to approve an education fund rate increase in the April 1, 2003 election. The increased education fund rate is projected to stabilize the District's education fund for the foreseeable future. There are residential developments currently pending within the District's boundaries that will increase future student enrollment in all schools. A cooperative ""Growth Committee"" between the City of Plano and District 88 has been organized to develop a plan that will accommodate these anticipated increases in student enrollment. I am expecting our EAV to decrease approximately 3%. Our personnel costs will likely increase 6-8%. Special ed costs always increase. These are significant to us, of course, but should not dramatically affect our financial outlook. Maintaining Hold Harmless is our biggest need. District #115 passed Education Fund and Building Fund referendums in the spring of 2002 in an effort to address our increased enrollment due to growth. Our Equalized Assessed Valuation is also increasing due to this growth. We had to increase our debt service to build the new buildings to house the additional students. We also have to hire additional staff to address increases in enrollment, further reducing our Education Fund balance. Regarding our financial profile score portion regarding the percent of longterm debt remaining: Our score is a 1, low percentage, due to extremely rapid growth and large construction initiatives. This percentage will remain low as long as we continue to build schools to meet the facility needs of our students.

The City of Zion was the home for a CommonWealth Edison nuclear power plant; this plant closed in 1997. After CommonWealth Edison made the decision to permanently close the plant in 1998 the affected taxing bodies worked with CommonWealth Edison to draft an Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) rampdown agreement. This ramp-down agreement, which was finalized in December 2000, decreased the EAV of the plant from $171,000,000 in tax year 199 to $10,000,000 in tax year 2005. This agreement resulted in a loss of 60% of our district's EAV, which directly affects the tax revenues of all funds. The District has taken steps to improve the financial health of the district, including a community-supported $.60 education fund tax rate increase in March 2002. While the education fund tax rate increase was an important step, it is necessary for the district to take further steps to ensure the financial solvency of the district. Our enrollment increase from year to year over the past 5 years has increased 15.6% per year. Our EAV has increased at about the same rate, however, revenues based on property taxes have not, mostly because of the Illinois Limited Tax Extension Act, Tax Cap. Additionally GSA has not increased applicably, and 49% of our revenue is State Aid.

The Board is also pleased with the designation of financial recognition as delineated by the new Profile system as it bears out the Board's dedication to providing a quality and challenging educational environment for the students of Deerfield, Highland Park and Riverwoods while maintaining a watchful eye on the bottom line. However, the Board does need to draw attention to the distinction between itself and other districts that report results of operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Deerfield School District 109 reports the results of its operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the cash basis of accounting. In Lake County, approximately 49% of an annual tax levy is distributed to school districts prior to July 1, the start of their fiscal years. Deerfield School District 109 properly reports these receipts as current year revenue in the income statement per the cash basis of accounting, while modified accrual basis of accounting districts report these receipts as deferred revenue, a liability on the balance sheet. Since approximately 80% of Deerfield School District 109's total revenue are generated by property tax collections, this particular item has found a profound effect on the district's FAAS ratio. This difference can be illustrated by utilizing District 109's information from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. As reported under the new School District Financial Profile system, District 109's FAAS ratio is calculated at .60. This ratio calculation provides the district with a score of 4, which is then weighted by 35%, the highest weight of the five categories that comprise the new Profile system. However, by using a crude calculation that removes the early tax collections from the district's FAAS score to 3, which when weighted by 35% and added to the other four categories, produces a total score of 3.55, on the cusp of the financial review designation and not as strong an indicator of financial strength as depicted by the 3.90 score achieved when using the FAAS score generated using the cash basis of accounting. The Board of Education sincerely hopes that the Illinois State Board of Education continues working towards a rating system that provides a fair comparison of financial health for Illinois School Districts, regardless of the basis of accounting that is utilized in their reporting methodology.

First, the State of Illinois was unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner. Our cash-basis budget was dependant upon receiving our fourth quarter categorical payments by June 30, 2002. This did not occur. Also, the tax bills for Lake County went out late, further eroding our revenue collections for FY02. Had these two separate events not occurred, our revenue would have been greater than our expenses and we would have had more cash on hand at year-end. This would have raised Wauconda CUSD 118's profile to the Financial Review category. Given that this assessment system is new, it should be noted that it could be unfairly influenced by uncontrollable acts from outside parties, especially for districts like ours who operate under a cash-basis accounting system.

The fund balances have been depleted due to unfunded state and federal mandates. Federal law calls for 40% funding of IDEA and state funding has a constitutional requirement of 51%. Currently, our district receives 5% of our revenue from fedreal sources and 35% from state funding. State Board of Education letter head proudly states at the bottom, ""Making Illinois Schools Second to None"" and should add a line stateing ""While Funding Second to Last"". The majority of our school assessments come from farmland which due to state law has been reduced over the past four years by the Illinois Farmland Assessment Reduction. We are meeting all state laws and ISBE requirements and have a perfect score on our state audits and quality assurance reviews. Our academic scores are, and have always been well above state standards. Our school was exempt from quality review for years because of exemplary state test scores. Our greatest current financial need is for the state and federal funding of schools to meet their legal obligation.

Our district profile was 3.9 out of a 4.0 and we received Financial Recognition. On February 6, 2003 we received the proposed profile for our district using data from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. Because our district had saved money and established a reserve to prepare for a building project and then expended these reserves this past year, the district was penalized using the formula. The School Accounting System does not allow for the flexible transferring of funds. The district had earmarked approximately $2.5 million in reserve money in the Ed Fund for the building project. All expenditures for the building project are required to come out of the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. Because of the deficit spending, we were rated a ""1"" in ""expenditures to revenue"" because of the building project and utilization of reserves. The Total Profile for the last year was 2.75 and placed us on an early warning list - which does not seem valid since the district has over $1.5 million remaining in the Ed Fund and $836,000 in the Working Cash Fund. I feel the profile should be determined on an average of the past three years to get a more accurate picture for the district. In summary, I do not feel this profile provides a valid representation of our district's assets.

In the 1980's the district was placed on the State's Financial Watch list as second year tax anticipation warrants were used to meet payroll and other financial obligations. In the early 1990's the district passed a $0.40 tax rate increase in the Education Fund. It was at this time that the farmland assessment and residential property assessments began to rise. The rise in residential property also brought an influx of students, which translated into additional State Aid. The Lincoln Community High School Board of Education also provided investment capital for the district through the sale of working cash bonds. The state was set to build the district's financial future through prudent fiscal management and solid investment opportunities. In 1997-98 a new funding formula was adopted by the legislature to calculate General State Aid. The new formula guaranteed school districts that they would not receive fewer State Aid dollars than they had previously received in 1997. This provision was called Hold Harmless. One of the objectives of the new Formula was to increase the Formula's Foundation Level each year until the Hold Harmless provision was no longer necessary, which has not occurred. Since the new Formula's inception LCHS has not received additional State Aid support. Instead, the district has been receiving Hold Harmless monies. In Fiscal Year 2002 Lincoln Community High School District #404 received $271,865 in Hold Harmless Aid. In Fiscal Year 2003 the amount of Hold Harmless Aid climbed to $477,921. This change in dependency on Hold Harmless is attributed to a declining student population and an increase in Equalized Assessed Value in the district. For the part four years the Illinois Legislature and the Illinois State Board of Education have discussed the probability of eliminating the Hold Harmless provision from the Funding Formula. Should this discussion become a reality then Lincoln Community High School's current fiscal stability will crumble.

In 1995, enrollment at some grade levels was in excess of 35 students per teacher, with second grade finishing the school year with one teacher for 41 students. Small storage closets were remodeled to provide space for counseling and for speech therapy services, but there were no rooms available for splitting classes. Restroom facilities were woefully insufficient to handle the student numbers enrolled at the time. In 1995, without foreknowledge that state construction funds would eventually become available and with the best interest of students in mind, the Board of Education felt it had no realistic alternative but to acquire two temporary classroom buildings, each with two classrooms. Restrooms were also built to accommodate increasing enrollment. Reserves were used to construct restroom facilities at a cost of $125,000. Likewise, the temporary classroom buildings were constructed through five year leave-purchase agreements, and the payments were made from district reserves at a cost of $250,000. Those buildings have now been incorporated into the school's new facility which was funded largely by a state construction grant. The Board of Education feels it noteworthy that the district has, since 1995, added three classroom teachers to reduce class sizes and has added a fulltime special education teacher and a half-time special education teacher to address the requirements of special needs students. The district has thus far been able to provide these services using local tax dollars (which are capped) and state and federal aid. It is the feeling of the Board of Education that the information contained in this profile should be analyzed in light of the fact that the district started out with reserves totaling $378.000 (June 30, 1994), has since that time built and staffed classrooms (regular and special education) in order to meet basic educational and legal needs and yet it finished the FY02 fiscal year (as indicated on the profile) with $200,000 remaining in reserves.

The reflections are not at all pleasant. As in many communities throughout the state, Centralia is experiencing a profound economic downturn. It is a matter of record that the levels of unemployment and poverty within this area are among the highest in the state. As a result, our schools must strive continually to reverse the effects of such poverty upon student learning. It is critical that our schools and the other schools with significant populations of low-income students be able to provide a high quality education through such methods as minimizing class size, maintaining optimum staffing levels, attracting and retaining highly qualified staff, providing adequate health and counseling services, sustaining education enrichment programs, and adequately meeting the education service requirements of special needs students. For most children of poverty, a quality education will be the only means through which they can realize a productive and stable life in adulthood. As is the case in many down-state districts, our local revenue sources are not adequate to provide the level of services needed by our students. These programs can only be realized and sustained through adequate funding from state and federal sources. Unfortunately, Centralia City Schools District #135 is scheduled to receive over $300,000 less in state aid for the 20022003 school year than it did for 2001-2002. Due to this decline in state funding and to an increase in operational expenses, our district has a current year deficit budgeted in excess of ($700,000 for 2002-2003). On Friday, February 7th, another crippling economic blow was dealt to our district when the 2000 Census Preliminary Data arrived. Incredibly, the 2000 census indicates that the number of students at poverty level within our district has decreased from 564 in 1990 to 393 in 2000. Our verifiable data supported by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and evidenced by the number of kids who are qualified for free or reduced means has steadily increased over the past 10 years. The fact that this supposed 30% decrease in the census poverty level has occurred within the county with the highest level of unemployment in the state makes the accuracy of census data all the more suspect. The 2000 census data for poverty levels clearly is not representative of the real conditions that exist in Centralia and many other communities. However, the funding inequities brought by this data will impact many schools in a most negative manner over the next ten years if it is allowed to stand. Centralia City Schools District #135 has worked long and hard to develop a top rated district, and we have accomplished this goal with expenditures below the average cost per student in Illinois and in the United States.

We have an efficient and successful school district. Unfortunately, the opportunities we provide our students will be at-risk if additional revenue is not provided. While reserves have allowed District #135 to continue without interruption for the current year, it is inevitable that serious reductions in expenditures will have to occur if adequate state funding is not forthcoming in the future. We anticipate that, as the effect of the 2000 census reduces our already reduced state aid, we will have a zero fund balance in the education fund within the coming year. Obviously the financial profile of Centralia #135 will take a steep nose dive if this occurs. Unless adequate funding is provided in the very near future, I see the deterioration of the district's educational services and financial standing as forgone conclusions. Nothing is more important than education. A well educated populace pays more taxes and lower costs for government in terms of welfare, containment, and services. An investment in education pays off more than any investment you can make. Please continue to lend your influence to securing adequate financing for the schools of Illinois. Thank you for your support of our school district and for any assistance that you can lend in this issue of critical importance.

In addition, cash flow problems are occurring due to the lateness of categorical payments from the Illinois comptroller due to the State's financial problems. District 200 is committed to operating within its means and reductions of $1.25 million were made to the 2002-2003 operating budgets and $2.2 million are being considered for 2003-2004. The funding methods of education in Illinois are outdated, inconsistent, unreliable, inequitable for students and relies too heavily on local property taxes.

If these funds are depleted and/or the ratio of expenditures to revenues is low, the district would receive a lower score on the District Financial Profile. This is what happened with last year's (2001-02) Financial Profile. During the 2001-02 school year Aledo 201 School District's financial designation changed from ""Recognition"" with a score of 3.55 to a designation of ""Early Warning"" with a score of 2.75. ""Recognition"" is the highest of the four designations, the ""Review"" and ""Early Warning"" is next to the bottom designation called ""Watch"". The reasons that Aledo changed so much in a single year are: 1) During the 2001-02 school year, the district moved $1,050,000 from the Education Fund into the Building Fund to build a new junior high school. The district patrons voted on a March 21, 2000 bond referendum to approve this depletion of the reserves in the Education Fund to build a new junior high school. 2) Besides the money being moved from the Education Fund, the Interest on that money is also depleted from the Education Fund. In our case, that amounts to $24,626. 3) The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) of students dropped by 18.7 students from the previous year resulting in a loss of over $85,000 that we would have received if our numbers would have stayed the same. Even though the district did receive an increase of $39,961 in General State Aid, that amount did not come close to the over 3% increase in expenditures of a 7 million dollar budget. It certainly does not help schools that the legislature cannot seem to decide how much money a district is to receive until May or June. This puts the district in the position of having to negotiate the teachers and staff and subsequently to build the next year's budget without knowing the actual money they will receive. Further, if the state determines that is has no money and gives no increase to the General State Aid like it did this year (2002-03) then districts with decreasing populations actually receive less state aid than the previous year.

Also a recent message from State Superintendent Schiller discussed the preliminary 2000 census data and its effect on the General State Aid poverty count for next year calculations. Our school district alone will lose $33,000 next year in general state aid using the new census poverty count. The process used is a skewed and unrepresentative count of those who truly qualify as poverty level in mine and other school districts. In my opinion and others, an audited free and reduced lunch count is the only true way to determine poverty in a local school district.

Maintaining this status in the future is going to be extremely difficult for the following reasons: 1) Changes in the poverty count of the 2000 Census will decrease the District's state and federal funding levels. 2) Decrease in student enrollment 3) Eroding local tax base due to the T.I.F. District and State land purchases. 4) The State of Illinois prorating payments. The District receives 61% of funding from state sources. As long as state aid payments increase the economic outlook appears healthy. However, the District is experiencing a declining student enrollment and a significant decrease in the poverty count as determined by the 2000 census. Depending on the poverty count the District could face between a $142,606 to $285,166 decrease in general state aid alone. Hopefully a hold harmless provision would decrease these amounts. Currently the State of Illinois has prorated special education and transportation funding costing the District $29,672 in revenue. There remains a question on state aid payments. Currently, unless legislators agree to fully fund state aid payments the best-case scenario is an additional $14,285 loss of state aid due to prorating. There is the possibility of creative state financing by sliding state aid payments into the next fiscal year.

During the decade of the 1990's through 2002 the District was able to accumulate a reasonable fund balance in its operating funds. The healthy economy fueled appropriations to keep up with increased operational costs. Unfortunately, the economy has bottomed out. States are not able to provide appropriations to assist with increased operational costs. The District is feeling the impact of the economy through reduced revenues as interest rates plummet, grants are pro-rated to less than 100% and costs continue to rise. To meet this economic challenge, the District began reducing expenditures during the 2002-03 year. It will also minimize the loss of programming for students by utilizing part of the accumulated surplus. As the poor economic conditions continue, the District foresees that its ranking on the financial profile will diminish. Great care and thought will be given to determine the most appropriate means to provide learning opportunities to the students and providing value to our community while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These decisions are difficult but necessary until the economy turns and the State is able to provide adequate assistance to meet the educational needs of the students.

These problems have been in the district for some time, and the school board is well aware of them. We as a district have been addressing these problems and we have made some real progress. Regardless of the financial problems, our district remains dedicated to bringing a quality program of education to our students. The main reason the district is experiencing financial shortfalls is due to reduced state funding. This can be traced back to the negative effect the new state aid formula had on high school districts and the pro-rating of state reimbursements, especially in the area of special education. The school district would not be facing financial difficulties if the state provided the funding appropriately.

STEPHENSON FREEPORT SCHOOL DIST 145 1.05 1.05 0.10 0.40 0.30 2.90 Financial Early Warning In an effort to raise achievement, the Freeport School District implemented a policy to reduce elementary class size. This initiative added staff and caused an increased budget deficit in the educational fund. The inability of the State to meet their financial obligations caused late payments to the district which were beyond the scope of the 2001-2002 fiscal year. This report reflects the financial position of the District and places a label on the District that is partially controlled by the receipt of the revenues. Late payments and pro-rated payments have caused the Freeport School District and many other Illinois School Districts to have significant cash flow problems. Freeport School District made a capital purchase of $500,000 for a transportation complex. This expense did not have an increase in balancing revenue, thus reflected a $500,000 deficit in the O&M Fund.

Building Maintenance Grant funds created surpluses in FY00 and 01 when the funds arrived. They added to a deficit in FY02 when some of the funds were expended. Some transportation and special education payments were received after July 1, 2002, and did not show up on the books for FY02. State aid payments in recent years have failed to keep pace with increasing labor and heating costs. The state continues to under fund special education mandates forcing schools to divert resources to pay for services required by legislature and the courts.

District financial solvency continues to be negatively impacted by the decision to eliminate the weighting of high school students, and by the reductions in funding from the State of Illinois. Fees and other local revenue sources have been increased, while several teaching positions have been reduced in order to control expenses. Without an improvement in state funding, Nashville Community High School may need to consider asking the local taxpayer's for a tax rate increase in the education and building funds.

School Board undertook some proactive cost-cutting measures. Namely, we instituted a ""retirementincentive buy-out"" program in which, among other things, the district offered eligible teachers to pay that respective teacher's ""2.2 upgrade"" PLUS a onetime bonus of a twenty percent (20%) check handed to them on the last day of instruction. As a result, some fourteen (14) veteran teachers opted for the incentives. Over the last four year, these fourteen people's buyout cost the district some $400,000.00 dollars in cash outlay. However, as this is my point, because of these retirements, the district has either absorbed or not replaced our of those fourtenn positions, thus saving about $200,000.00 dollars. Additionaly, of the other teaching positions that we did replace now -, we replace a teacher making $55,000.00 with a new fresh-out-ofschool teacher hired in at $25,000.00 - hence, saving the district about $30,000.00 per hire. If you do the math, the cumulative savings in ten years more than amount to $300,000.00 per teacher, with a net savings in ten years of almost three million dollars in salaries and benefits! NOW HERE IS WHERE THE RUB COMES IN! Under the state's new criteria, there ais a cumulative hit, a ""snowballing effect"" or a multiplying of factors in regards to finances. First of all, because of the buyout incentives, the outlay of $400,000.00 in bonuses caused our fund balances to dramatically decrease this affecting our Fund Balance to Revenue Ratio; secondly, since these monies are cash outlays, our Expenditures went upward markedly causing our Expenditures to Revenue Ratio to be affected; thirdly, then our Days Cash on Hand ratio is lowered. Finanlly, our Long-Term Debt Margin is caused by the fact that we built a brand new five and one-half million dollar ($5,500,000.00) K-8 building (at the encouragement of the state, I might add) replacing a nearly 100 year old structure! SO! - We are exasperated! Moreover, some of out funding from the state (transportation) has been delayed by almost three months! In sum, I am a great believer in accountability and good stewardship. However, punishing us with the lowest classification label of Financial Watch belies the point that the criteria are too planar and myopic in the sense of merely looking at the numbers and not as to the HOW'S AND WHY'S of the numbers!

The passage of this referendum will infuse approximately $2.5 million additional tax dollars into the Education Fund. The last referendum was in 1989. Since then the district has also been placed under Tax Caps. The Board of Education understands the need to increase revenues and decrease expenditures in order to work towards a balanced budget. Over the past few years with the failure of other referendum questions, the district has reduced expenditures by approximately $4 million and has also made further reductions for the FY04 budget year. The amount listed for Long Term Debt also includes items that have been classified as ""Other Long Term Debt"". These items should not lower the amount of the Legal Debt Margin of the district, as they are not part of any bond indebtedness. They pertain to compensated balances, accreted interest, and a possible arbitrage rebate according to the District's audit firm, BDO Seidman. The removal of these items would increase the percentage remaining of the Legal Debt Margin to 31%. However, this change will not effect the overall classification of the district as reported by the ISBE Financial Profile System.

Moving from an area that projects ""potential downward trends"" to the high rating of ""financial strength"" particularly when the fund balances reflect early local taxes, which show the financial stability of our district. Local officials look as if they are ""crying wolf"" when difficult decisions are being made to reduce local spending.

The 2002 School District Financial Profile is misleading because the only reason the Hononegah CHSD 207 received a higher score was due to the fact that it borrowed 3.5 million dollars in tax anticipation warrants which showed on the district's financial records as increased revenue for the year and lead to a higher cash balance and increased days of available cash. In reality the district is slowly increasing its deficit and now has needed to barrow funds in order to maintain all of its current programs.

If these funds are depleted and/or the ratio of expenditures to revenues is low, the district would receive a lower score on the District Financial Profile. This is what happened with last year's (2001-02) Financial Profile. During the 2001-02 school year Aledo 201 School District's financial designation changed from ""Recognition"" with a score of 3.55 to a designation of ""Early Warning"" with a score of 2.75. ""Recognition"" is the highest of the four designations, the ""Review"" and ""Early Warning"" is next to the bottom designation called ""Watch"". The reasons that Aledo changed so much in a single year are: 1) During the 2001-02 school year, the district moved $1,050,000 from the Education Fund into the Building Fund to build a new junior high school. The district patrons voted on a March 21, 2000 bond referendum to approve this depletion of the reserves in the Education Fund to build a new junior high school. 2) Besides the money being moved from the Education Fund, the Interest on that money is also depleted from the Education Fund. In our case, that amounts to $24,626. 3) The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) of students dropped by 18.7 students from the previous year resulting in a loss of over $85,000 that we would have received if our numbers would have stayed the same. Even though the district did receive an increase of $39,961 in General State Aid, that amount did not come close to the over 3% increase in expenditures of a 7 million dollar budget. It certainly does not help schools that the legislature cannot seem to decide how much money a district is to receive until May or June. This puts the district in the position of having to negotiate the teachers and staff and subsequently to build the next year's budget without knowing the actual money they will receive. Further, if the state determines that is has no money and gives no increase to the General State Aid like it did this year (2002-03) then districts with decreasing populations actually receive less state aid than the previous year.

For the purposes of debt margin, principal of $1,975,000 from the 1987 Building Bond should be subtracted from the total principal due. The proceeds from this bond are exempt from the 6.9 % debt limitation ceiling by referendum. Arbor Park School District 145 is not on the Watch List, rather, it is in the second category of Financial Review where it was last year and where most neighboring school districts are. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile does not take into account one-time major expenditures that are paid by bond proceeds. During the 2001-2002 school year, Arbor Park School District 145 paid for airconditioning and new school buses from bond proceeds. These expenditures were matched with revenues from bond proceeds. The State Board of Education's process for calculating the school district's financial profile did not take this into account. As a result, a financially stable school district is reported as being in financial trouble. This is unconscionable and irresponsible. For the record, Arbor Park School District 145 is not on the Watch List!

This can be traced back to the negative effect the new state aid formula had on high school districts and the pro-rating of state reimbursements, especially in the area of special education. The school district would not be facing financial difficulties if the state provided the funding appropriately. Our district is definitely in need of additional revenue to offset the annual contractual personnel increasing cost. Our personnel costs are increasing substantially faster than new revenue is being generated for our district. We are looking into the possibility of a referendum.

At the January 27, 2003 Meeting of the Board of Education the Board voted to place a $1.25 increase in the Education Fund Tax Rate on the ballot as a referendum for April 1, 2003. This referendum, if passed would generate about $1.3 million per year. 3. The teacher contract for Carlinville teachers ends on August 1, 2003. The union has agreed to begin bargaining now (first session February 20, 2003) in order to clarify salary costs as soon as possible. This will help determine salary cost for next year as soon as possible. 4. Over the last three years the district has suffered a 90 student drop in enrollment and a slightly increasing EAV. 5. In the last three years the district has suffered a $360,000 loss or reduction in General State Aid. 6. In the last two years the district has suffered a $200,000 loss in Corporate Personal Property Replacement Taxes. 7. Tax caps, in the last year, have forced the district to suffer an increase in revenue of 1.6% versus a 7% increase in expenditures. These are increased expenditures such as special education costs, liability insurance, contractual commitments, health insurance and unfunded mandates, all of which the district has no control over.  CARLYLE C U SCHOOL DISTRICT 1  1.05  1.05  0.20  0.40  0.10  2.80  Financial Early Warning  Carlyle school district has for the past three years planned and reduced expenditures on a regular basis. We have reduced 15% of the certified staff and 25% of the administrative staff through retirements. We are in the middle of a $7,500,000 project with revenues from the Capital Development Board and a bond referendum. The district has sought additional revenue sources and cuts have been made on expenditure line items. A sincere effort has been made to be cost effective. Carlyle school district has lost significant funds by a declining interest rate on investments, state and federal grants and reductions in state aid as EAV growth has minimally taken place along with increases in operating costs. Carlyle like many districts is on the financial early warning list. The Board of Education and administration will continue to seek ways to provide the best educational opportunities for students at the most reasonable cost.

The reflections are not at all pleasant. As in many communities throughout the state, Centralia is experiencing a profound economic downturn. It is a matter of record that the levels of unemployment and poverty within this area are among the highest in the state. As a result, our schools must strive continually to reverse the effects of such poverty upon student learning. It is critical that our schools and the other schools with significant populations of low-income students be able to provide a high quality education through such methods as minimizing class size, maintaining optimum staffing levels, attracting and retaining highly qualified staff, providing adequate health and counseling services, sustaining education enrichment programs, and adequately meeting the education service requirements of special needs students. For most children of poverty, a quality education will be the only means through which they can realize a productive and stable life in adulthood. As is the case in many down-state districts, our local revenue sources are not adequate to provide the level of services needed by our students. These programs can only be realized and sustained through adequate funding from state and federal sources. Unfortunately, Centralia City Schools District #135 is scheduled to receive over $300,000 less in state aid for the 20022003 school year than it did for 2001-2002. Due to this decline in state funding and to an increase in operational expenses, our district has a current year deficit budgeted in excess of ($700,000 for 2002-2003). On Friday, February 7th, another crippling economic blow was dealt to our district when the 2000 Census Preliminary Data arrived. Incredibly, the 2000 census indicates that the number of students at poverty level within our district has decreased from 564 in 1990 to 393 in 2000. Our verifiable data supported by the Department of Human Services (DHS) and evidenced by the number of kids who are qualified for free or reduced means has steadily increased over the past 10 years. The fact that this supposed 30% decrease in the census poverty level has occurred within the county with the highest level of unemployment in the state makes the accuracy of census data all the more suspect. The 2000 census data for poverty levels clearly is not representative of the real conditions that exist in Centralia and many other communities. However, the funding inequities brought by this data will impact many schools in a most negative manner over the next ten years if it is allowed to stand. Centralia City Schools District #135 has worked long and hard to develop a top rated district, and we have accomplished this goal with expenditures below the average cost per student in Illinois and in the United States.

We have an efficient and successful school district. Unfortunately, the opportunities we provide our students will be at-risk if additional revenue is not provided. While reserves have allowed District #135 to continue without interruption for the current year, it is inevitable that serious reductions in expenditures will have to occur if adequate state funding is not forthcoming in the future. We anticipate that, as the effect of the 2000 census reduces our already reduced state aid, we will have a zero fund balance in the education fund within the coming year. Obviously the financial profile of Centralia #135 will take a steep nose dive if this occurs. Unless adequate funding is provided in the very near future, I see the deterioration of the district's educational services and financial standing as forgone conclusions. Nothing is more important than education. A well educated populace pays more taxes and lower costs for government in terms of welfare, containment, and services. An investment in education pays off more than any investment you can make. Please continue to lend your influence to securing adequate financing for the schools of Illinois. Thank you for your support of our school district and for any assistance that you can lend in this issue of critical importance.

The District committed deficit spending, depending on operating funds and existing fund balances, to meet debt retirement obligations. The District meets its Alternate Revenue Bond debt retirement obligation by transferring interest from the Education, Operations and Maintenance, and Working Cash Funds to the Bond & Interest Fund. The principal and interest obligation is expensed via the Bond & Interest Fund. This expense (approximately $3.3 million annually) is not included in the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio. If this expense were included the Expenditures to Revenue Ratio, the District would score 2 in this category for fiscal year 2001/02. Over the past three years, District 59 has lost over $8 million in anticipated revenue to pay property tax refunds issued through Cook County. The loss of property taxes due to refunds is causing the District to implement expenditure reductions and to seek revenue alternatives, such as a debt service extension base.

For FY02 our ranking dropped to Financial Watch List. The reason for the change can be accounted for in the scoring of the expenditure to revenue ratio. This is the only section of the five in which our scoring dropped from the previous year. In FY01 our score was a ""4"", in FY02 we dropped to a ""2"". The reason for the drop is attributed to nearly $8M of expenditures in the Operations & Maintenance Fund, which were construction related. We budgeted $5M for payout of construction work associated with a $52.5M project, which was only supported by a $25 referendum (and did not include equipment and furniture). A $7M State Construction Grant, operating funds and fund balances, offset the remaining $17.5M. Additionally, in FY02 we expended $3M for 36 portable classroom complexes at both of our high schools. In total we are doing $11M worth of work at our high schools (including portables), which is being paid for by an $11M Working Cash Bond Sale. The proceeds from this bond sale are not shown as revenue in FY02 even though the expenditures are included. While we still had a negative operating budget (not including the $11M), our ranking without the impact of construction would have only slipped to Financial Review not Financial Watch List.

Voters of the district defeated a referendum for an education fund tax rate increase of $1.00 in the spring of 2002. The district issued $725,000 of working cash bonds in December 2003 which will help a projected $250,000 budget deficit for FY03 and assist with cash flow problems. Approximately $425,000 of program and personnel cuts will be made in the FY04 budget, which includes closing an elementary building. In April 2003 voters will be asked to approve a $.50 education fund tax rate increase. The district is projected to lose just under $1,000,000 of assessed value on the 2002 tax levy, which is payable in 2003. Student enrollment is expected to decline. It is anticipated that the FY04 budget will be balanced, however, the district could quickly be back into a deficit situation if there are unexpected increases in operational costs, and if promised state funding continues to come late and at less that 100%. April 1, 2003 referendum results will impact our available funds for FY 04. $700,000 for FY02 grant money was not received until after the close of the fiscal year on June 30, 2002. This late payment, in addition to the proration of our state Transportation reimbursement for FY02, caused the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio to fall into Category 2. Neither of these factors were under the direct control of School District 130.

The Board is also pleased with the designation of financial recognition as delineated by the new Profile system as it bears out the Board's dedication to providing a quality and challenging educational environment for the students of Deerfield, Highland Park and Riverwoods while maintaining a watchful eye on the bottom line. However, the Board does need to draw attention to the distinction between itself and other districts that report results of operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Deerfield School District 109 reports the results of its operations to the Illinois State Board of Education on the cash basis of accounting. In Lake County, approximately 49% of an annual tax levy is distributed to school districts prior to July 1, the start of their fiscal years. Deerfield School District 109 properly reports these receipts as current year revenue in the income statement per the cash basis of accounting, while modified accrual basis of accounting districts report these receipts as deferred revenue, a liability on the balance sheet. Since approximately 80% of Deerfield School District 109's total revenue are generated by property tax collections, this particular item has found a profound effect on the district's FAAS ratio. This difference can be illustrated by utilizing District 109's information from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. As reported under the new School District Financial Profile system, District 109's FAAS ratio is calculated at .60. This ratio calculation provides the district with a score of 4, which is then weighted by 35%, the highest weight of the five categories that comprise the new Profile system. However, by using a crude calculation that removes the early tax collections from the district's FAAS score to 3, which when weighted by 35% and added to the other four categories, produces a total score of 3.55, on the cusp of the financial review designation and not as strong an indicator of financial strength as depicted by the 3.90 score achieved when using the FAAS score generated using the cash basis of accounting. The Board of Education sincerely hopes that the Illinois State Board of Education continues working towards a rating system that provides a fair comparison of financial health for Illinois School Districts, regardless of the basis of accounting that is utilized in their reporting methodology.

We are one of the 61% of Illinois school districts deficit spending this fiscal year. The number may rise to 85% by the end of this year. Also a recent message from State Superintendent Schiller discussed the preliminary 2000 census data and its effect on the General State Aid poverty count for next year calculations. Our school district alone will lose $33,000 next year in general state aid using the new census poverty count. The process used is a skewed and unrepresentative count of those who truly qualify as poverty level in mine and other school districts. In my opinion and others, an audited free and reduced lunch count is the only true way to determine poverty in a local school district. Given our 2002 profile score, District 401 has an awesome task to elevate its score to a 4. Tax caps and state budget limitations are not positive signs that much progress can be made in improving our score. This district has made cuts in the past and are limited in reducing more without reducing programs and attempting to meet the unbelievable challenges contained in NCLB.

During the 2000-01 school year the District sold $12,500,000 worth of Working Cash Fund bonds to fund a 5 year renovation project on the high school. During each of those years expenses for renovations appearing in the Operations and Maintenance Fund and have been and will be paid for with cooresponding revenue transfers to the O & M Fund from the Working Cash Fund. Since the Expenditure to Revenue Ratio Indicator excludes the Working Cash Fund and fund transfers, expenses for this type of project are recorded but the revenues are not. For FY 2002, reported here, $5,455,907 in expenses for the renovations to the facility were included in the Operations and Maintenance figures but the transfer from Working Cash for the same amount to pay for those renovations that is reflected in the District's Annual Financial Report FY2002 is not included as revenue to offset that expense. Consequently the District ratio for this indicator was incorrectly listed as 1.14. It should have been 1.05. The impact of this inaccuracy is that the District should have received an overall score of 3.55 instead of 3.2.

Over eleven million dollars in construction bonds were issued in Fiscal Year 2002. This impacted the district's remaining debt margin (one of the factors which comprises the ISBE financial profile score). The Board of Education and administration were notified in September, 2001, by the state's Capital Development Board, that the district is eligible for $5,758 million in state funds for this construction project. To date, the state has not yet released these critical funds. Late payments by the state for categorical reimbursement for eligible transportation and special education expenses also negatively affected Fiscal Year 2002 revenues. As of June 30, 2002, over $275,000 was vouchered by ISBE as due and payable to the district but not remitted on time. Indeed, the weak economy has created financial problems at the state level which are now impacting local schools reliant on promised state financial support. The district will continue to monitor expenditures while the state seeks an answer to its revenue shortfalls. The district remains confident that ultimately the construction project will achieve greater efficiency regarding lighting, heating and maintenance costs. Additionally, more evenly distributed class size in the elementary buildings should also be achievable with the reconfigured early childhood learning center and two elementary buildings. The district is committed to continuing to offer a quality educational program within the constraints imposed by property tax caps and weakened state support. The Board of Education recently adopted a resolution in favor of the Educational Funding Advisory Board (EFAB) plan for better and more equitable funding of schools.

Health benefit costs increased significantly. Two new classrooms were constructed at Hester Junior High School. A new comprehensive reading program for K-8 was purchased. East School, which had previously been leased, was reopened to house the LASEC early childhood special education program. The district sold fire prevention and life safety bonds to fund life safety improvements in the school district. Declining enrollment, coupled with questionable state and federal revenue sources create a financial picture difficult to project.

This initiative added staff and caused an increased budget deficit in the educational fund. The inability of the State to meet their financial obligations caused late payments to the district which were beyond the scope of the 2001-2002 fiscal year. This report reflects the financial position of the District and places a label on the District that is partially controlled by the receipt of the revenues. Late payments and pro-rated payments have caused the Freeport School District and many other Illinois School Districts to have significant cash flow problems. Freeport School District made a capital purchase of $500,000 for a transportation complex. This expense did not have an increase in balancing revenue, thus reflected a $500,000 deficit in the O&M Fund.

The more recent phenomenon of the significant increase in property tax refunds will result in an additional financial burden to the school district. This fiscal year to date, District 67 has lost $252,000 in property tax refunds. The majority of those refunds, $192,000, results from commercial business refunds from tax years 1995 and 1996. Beginning in 1998 through 2001, Property Tax Appeals Board (PTAB) objections may cause the District to lose an additional $1.01 million. There is no mechanism at this time to recover this revenue. The PTAB process has provided commercial and industrial property owners with an incentive to increase the volume of property assessment appeals. In summary, because of legislation that encourages commercial and industrial property owners to file assessment appeals, a greater financial burden is placed both on residential property owners as property tax payers and the school district as a taxing body.

The passage of this referendum will infuse approximately $2.5 million additional tax dollars into the Education Fund. The last referendum was in 1989. Since then the district has also been placed under Tax Caps. The Board of Education understands the need to increase revenues and decrease expenditures in order to work towards a balanced budget. Over the past few years with the failure of other referendum questions, the district has reduced expenditures by approximately $4 million and has also made further reductions for the FY04 budget year. The amount listed for Long Term Debt also includes items that have been classified as ""Other Long Term Debt"". These items should not lower the amount of the Legal Debt Margin of the district, as they are not part of any bond indebtedness. They pertain to compensated balances, accreted interest, and a possible arbitrage rebate according to the District's audit firm, BDO Seidman. The removal of these items would increase the percentage remaining of the Legal Debt Margin to 31%. However, this change will not effect the overall classification of the district as reported by the ISBE Financial Profile System. We will not try to vote a referendum in 2003. Maybe in 2004.

Future funding of this program is critical to the future financial solvency of this district. Due to the fact that we have built two (2) new buildings and renovated two (2) others, our long-term debt has caused us to be placed on the financial early warning list.

The 2002 School District Financial Profile is misleading because the only reason the Hononegah CHSD 207 received a higher score was due to the fact that it borrowed 3.5 million dollars in tax anticipation warrants which showed on the district's financial records as increased revenue for the year and lead to a higher cash balance and increased days of available cash.

They responded affirmatively and we are waiting for the State of Illinois to release the Construction Grant money so that we can break ground on construction. Prior to the 2001-2002 fiscal year, the district was without long-term debt. The 2001-2002 budget projection indicated that expenditures would grow beyond revenue for the first time in over five years. This was due almost entirely to an increase in staffing to match the needs of a growing enrollment. The community approved a second referendum for a $.60 increase in the education fund tax rate. We believe the districts response to its environment was both appropriate and timely and much more positive than the 2.80 profile would lead one to believe. A decrease in EAV is anticipated due to an onslaught of property tax appeal board cases coming from Cook County Commercial property taxpayers. Tax appeals as early as 1993-1996 have resulted in an unanticipated 12% reduction in 2001 tax collections. Notice of appeal was never required by law to be given to the affected taxing bodies, nor is there any relief provided under the current tax cap structure.

This projection assumes that the District will receive 24 General State Aid payments. There is much talk about school districts not receiving two General State Aid payments during this fiscal year. A loss of two General State Aid payments would mean an additional $265,000 loss to the District. This would be absolutely disastrous. At the present rate, we will expend all of our reserves during the 2004-2005 school year with limited capacity to raise additional revenue. The Board has instituted several cost controlling measures that reduced deficit spending by over $300,000 per year. The cost controlling measures are: Eliminated an administrative position Eliminated 5 certified positions Eliminated 4 non certified positions Closed an elementary school Reduced travel, supply and equipment budgets Many financial concerns exist for the 2003-2004 school year. There are concerns about possible reductions in State revenue and increases in maintenance costs, general personnel costs, insurance costs and special education costs. Unit #9 is heavily reliant on General State aid to meet operational expenses. Therefore, when the State cuts or freezes funding to schools it has a dramatic effect on our school district. To date, we have no solid information about what will happen with State funding, but the outlook appears to be bleak. Moreover, the Board has fully utilized the local tax levy by taxing at the maximum rates. The Board has also substantially increased the Tort Fund revenue to pay salaries for employees who are involved in risk management activities. This practice has increased the overall tax rate that our community is assessed. The Board is also extremely sensitive to the economic woes in our area. The unemployment rate in Watseka is approaching double digits as a number of factories have shut their doors over the past few months. This, in addition to a depressed farm economy, limits our community's ability to support schools with their tax dollars.

The rev/exp ratio looks bad even though there are invested dollars earmarked for the expense. Due to sudden enrollment growth in the 90's the district found itself facing serious overcrowding at a number of grade levels. In 1995, enrollment at some grade levels was in excess of 35 students per teacher, with second grade finishing the school year with one teacher for 41 students. Small storage closets were remodeled to provide space for counseling and for speech therapy services, but there were no rooms available for splitting classes. Restroom facilities were woefully insufficient to handle the student numbers enrolled at the time. In 1995, without foreknowledge that state construction funds would eventually become available and with the best interest of students in mind, the Board of Education felt it had no realistic alternative but to acquire two temporary classroom buildings, each with two classrooms. Restrooms were also built to accommodate increasing enrollment. Reserves were used to construct restroom facilities at a cost of $125,000. Likewise, the temporary classroom buildings were constructed through five year leave-purchase agreements, and the payments were made from district reserves at a cost of $250,000. Those buildings have now been incorporated into the school's new facility which was funded largely by a state construction grant. The Board of Education feels it noteworthy that the district has, since 1995, added three classroom teachers to reduce class sizes and has added a fulltime special education teacher and a half-time special education teacher to address the requirements of special needs students. The district has thus far been able to provide these services using local tax dollars (which are capped) and state and federal aid. It is the feeling of the Board of Education that the information contained in this profile should be analyzed in light of the fact that the district started out with reserves totaling $378.000 (June 30, 1994), has since that time built and staffed classrooms (regular and special education) in order to meet basic educational and legal needs and yet it finished the FY02 fiscal year (as indicated on the profile) with $200,000 remaining in reserves.

This caused a drastic change in our Expenditure to Revenue ratio. The difference between District 158's Financial profile designation for FY01 (financial review) and District 158's Financial profile as indicated on this preliminary report (financial watch) is not a true indicator of District 158's financial status. District 158 charges against the budget all salaries in the year they are earned. Some districts charge salaries only as they are paid. If we used an accrual accounting system we would charge the salaries as expenses and show an asset titled Prepaid Salaries. This is what actually happened. Salaries are paid in one fiscal year but checks are not issued until July and August in the next fiscal year. This diminished the cash on hand according to the financial records, yet the cash is still in the bank. This amounts to $970,173.56 for fiscal year 01/02.

On January 9, 2003 all districts received a sample profile of the financial condition of the district based upon the school's Annual Financial Report for 2000-2001. Our district profile was 3.9 out of a 4.0 and we received Financial Recognition. On February 6, 2003 we received the proposed profile for our district using data from the 2001-2002 Annual Financial Report. Because our district had saved money and established a reserve to prepare for a building project and then expended these reserves this past year, the district was penalized using the formula. The School Accounting System does not allow for the flexible transferring of funds. The district had earmarked approximately $2.5 million in reserve money in the Ed Fund for the building project. All expenditures for the building project are required to come out of the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. The district is not allowed to move the money from one fund to another, but must deficit spend and deposit state aide payments into the Site and Construction Fund. Because of the deficit spending, we were rated a ""1"" in ""expenditures to revenue"" because of the building project and utilization of reserves. The Total Profile for the last year was 2.75 and placed us on an early warning list - which does not seem valid since the district has over $1.5 million remaining in the Ed Fund and $836,000 in the Working Cash Fund. I feel the profile should be determined on an average of the past three years to get a more accurate picture for the district. In summary, I do not feel this profile provides a valid representation of our district's assets.

In the 1980's the district was placed on the State's Financial Watch list as second year tax anticipation warrants were used to meet payroll and other financial obligations. In the early 1990's the district passed a $0.40 tax rate increase in the Education Fund. It was at this time that the farmland assessment and residential property assessments began to rise. The rise in residential property also brought an influx of students, which translated into additional State Aid. The Lincoln Community High School Board of Education also provided investment capital for the district through the sale of working cash bonds. The state was set to build the district's financial future through prudent fiscal management and solid investment opportunities. In 1997-98 a new funding formula was adopted by the legislature to calculate General State Aid. The new formula guaranteed school districts that they would not receive fewer State Aid dollars than they had previously received in 1997. This provision was called Hold Harmless. One of the objectives of the new Formula was to increase the Formula's Foundation Level each year until the Hold Harmless provision was no longer necessary, which has not occurred. Since the new Formula's inception LCHS has not received additional State Aid support. Instead, the district has been receiving Hold Harmless monies. In Fiscal Year 2002 Lincoln Community High School District #404 received $271,865 in Hold Harmless Aid. In Fiscal Year 2003 the amount of Hold Harmless Aid climbed to $477,921. This change in dependency on Hold Harmless is attributed to a declining student population and an increase in Equalized Assessed Value in the district. For the part four years the Illinois Legislature and the Illinois State Board of Education have discussed the probability of eliminating the Hold Harmless provision from the Funding Formula. Should this discussion become a reality then Lincoln Community High School's current fiscal stability will crumble.

This is because a district's cash balance changes daily with a continuous flow of revenue and expenses. Therefore, a certain point-in-time must be determined. In Illinois, that point-in-time is June 30. The establishment of any common date across Illinois is somewhat problematic in that different counties receive major tax deposits at different times of the year. Cook County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in October, while DuPage County districts receive a semi-annual tax deposit in June. One who analyzes a financial profile needs to understand this, as the financial health of a school district in DuPage County may appear healthier than school districts in other counties. Since Maercker District 60 does, in fact, receive major tax deposits each June, its financial health appears rosier than it may be when making statewide comparisons.

Management of local (89%), state (8%) and federal (3%) funds at a ""break-even"" level has not had a negative impact on quality education at our local level. The following factors relate to the financial situation at Morris Elementary: 1) The expenditures of the district are increasing at a higher rate than the equalized assessed valuation of the district. 2) The $.92 education fund tax rate is among the lowest in the state. The revenue that is generated in the education fund is well below what is necessary to educate the number of students that attend district schools. As a result, the district issued Working Cash Bonds in order to meet annual expenses. 3) The district is in the process of repaying $25,600,000 of building bonds that were approved by the district voters for the construction of a new elementary school. The bonds will be paid in full during the 2018-19 school year.

Numerous expenses were incurred during the final phase of construction and moving into the new facility, which is the primary reason the expenditure to revenue ratio was greater than 1 for FY02. These were planned expenses for which money had been saved. Because the reorganization expenses were included in FY02, the expenditures were inflated to $15,147,886. With the exception of summer projects completed in FY03, the expenditures will be back to a more realistic number for FY03 ($12,395,652). The School Board of Education and Administration are working diligently to operate within a balanced budget.

When a school district is heavily reliant on State Aid, regardless of whether that is caused by lack of local wealth or tax base, any manipulation of the level of State Aid has immediate and direct consequences to that district. Schools that are reliant on State Aid to meet their daily obligations are constantly challenged to maintain financial integrity. Many of the challenges we face stem from delays, prorated dollars, and/or missed payments altogether. The Mulberry Grove Community Unit Schools have been extremely diligent in the planning and implementation of the District's budget. There is no question that every effort is being made to wisely spend the limited resources that we have available to fund our educational programs. The community has supported a substantial levy, yet as you are well aware we are heavily reliant on State Aid to finance our total program. The Mulberry Grove Schools are facing the very same problems as so many others are faced with throughout our State. We are faced with the increasing pressure of financial, statutory, litigated, and otherwise mandated obligations at both the State and Federal levels. At the very same time, we are expected to deal with decreasing revenues and other resources to meet these obligations. It should be recognized that the biggest problem this district faces is one of cash flow, not over spending. Many measures have been put in place to address our local financial concerns. A great amount of daily attention and energy is spent in doing our very best in providing a quality education for our students. The fact is we are heavily reliant on State Aid in order to meet our financial obligations. The fact that the State itself has not met its obligations by funding mandates fully, and providing revenues in a timely manner that are not prorated has complicated matters significantly. There is no doubt that since we are so reliant on State Aid that fluctuations and arbitrary manipulations of financial formulas certainly affect our local financial picture dramatically. Regardless of what is or is not done to help with this situation, we will continue to serve the students and members of this community to the very best of our ability.

This means that the ISBE will be monitoring our school district closely and offering proactive technical assistance. Based on the information from ISBE management, there will be a large number of school districts on the state watch list. The ISBE estimates that 85% of school districts will be deficit spending by the end of this fiscal year. Based on conversation with other local school district administrators, our district is not alone in our financial woes. We project that the district's education fund could have a deficit fund balance of 1 million dollars by the end of the fiscal year. If the district continues to experience expenditures as we have in the past, we could reach a $5 million deficit by FY2005. Many factors have contributed to our school district's financial condition. Decreases in general state aid revenues ($382,000 decrease this year - could be more if 23rd and 24th State Aid payments are prorated or received late, as predicted) due to declining enrollment and a freeze in the funding foundation level, as well as proration of categorical grants by as much as 85% (i.e.. Special education and transportation) have had a large impact on district revenues. The district has also felt the effect of tax caps, which have limited the amount of property insurance premiums, which have nearly doubled, increasing costs by $150,000. Personnel costs have increased substantially due to significant salary increases over the past three years, although average salaries for teachers and administrators continue to fall below the state average. Personnel costs increased by over $300,000 in FY03. The State of Illinois is potentially faced with a $5 billion deficit. The district would like to attempt to cut 1/2 million dollars from our budget next year to help alleviate the situation. It appears that it could be at least 18 months before school districts get any relief through proposed income tax increases or other funding. Future considerations and concerns for our school district will be further decreases in state aid, tax caps, increased cost of health insurance, workman's compensation and property insurance and contract negotiations, variables which could cost the district an undeterminable amount of money. At present, the financial forecast for the State as well as the financial position of the district, in our opinion, creates the following conclusions: One way for the district to address our financial concerns will be through attrition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 55 of 83   District Name Max  FBRR (1.4)  EXRV (1.4)  DCOH (0.4)  STB (0.4)  LTD (0.4)  Score (4.0)  Designation  District Comments created by employee retirements district wide.

School Board undertook some proactive cost-cutting measures. Namely, we instituted a ""retirementincentive buy-out"" program in which, among other things, the district offered eligible teachers to pay that respective teacher's ""2.2 upgrade"" PLUS a onetime bonus of a twenty percent (20%) check handed to them on the last day of instruction. As a result, some fourteen (14) veteran teachers opted for the incentives. Over the last four year, these fourteen people's buyout cost the district some $400,000.00 dollars in cash outlay. However, as this is my point, because of these retirements, the district has either absorbed or not replaced our of those fourtenn positions, thus saving about $200,000.00 dollars. Additionaly, of the other teaching positions that we did replace now -, we replace a teacher making $55,000.00 with a new fresh-out-ofschool teacher hired in at $25,000.00 - hence, saving the district about $30,000.00 per hire. If you do the math, the cumulative savings in ten years more than amount to $300,000.00 per teacher, with a net savings in ten years of almost three million dollars in salaries and benefits! NOW HERE IS WHERE THE RUB COMES IN! Under the state's new criteria, there ais a cumulative hit, a ""snowballing effect"" or a multiplying of factors in regards to finances. First of all, because of the buyout incentives, the outlay of $400,000.00 in bonuses caused our fund balances to dramatically decrease this affecting our Fund Balance to Revenue Ratio; secondly, since these monies are cash outlays, our Expenditures went upward markedly causing our Expenditures to Revenue Ratio to be affected; thirdly, then our Days Cash on Hand ratio is lowered. Finanlly, our Long-Term Debt Margin is caused by the fact that we built a brand new five and one-half million dollar ($5,500,000.00) K-8 building (at the encouragement of the state, I might add) replacing a nearly 100 year old structure! SO! - We are exasperated! Moreover, some of out funding from the state (transportation) has been delayed by almost three months! In sum, I am a great believer in accountability and good stewardship. However, punishing us with the lowest classification label of Financial Watch belies the point that the criteria are too planar and myopic in the sense of merely looking at the numbers and not as to the HOW'S AND WHY'S of the numbers!

During the years from 1982-1993, when we were unsuccessful in passing our referendum and with the decline in State Aid, our district cut programs, cut staff and closed two buildings in an attempt to stay financially solvent. With the passage of the referendum in 1993, it appeared that our district's financial troubles were a thing of the past. Little did we realize however, that tax caps were on their way and would have a major negative impact on the financial health of our district. Because of the tax cap, District 117 has lost over six million dollars in local revenue. We have never fully accessed our approved .90 increase. This is not fair. Our local voters gave us authority in 1993 to raise our educational tax rate. This is local control at its best. However, because of the imposition of the tax caps, my district is starting to see an erosion of our financial base and expenditures, surpassing our revenues. We have very few alternatives if we intend to maintain our programs. This month (Feb. 03) will focus on borrowing $8,665,000 in working cash bonds to help balance the budget. What does the State expect us to do when our borrowed money is gone? Although the State has made verbal commitment to increase educational funding, we have not seen increases in District 117. What we have seen are additional limitations such as the imposition of administration tax caps in the 2000/01 budget which have limited expenses in legislatively designed accounts to 5% increases and restricted grants covering only a portion of the costs for new programs. Tax caps for Cook County and limited State Aid have also made us apprehensive of promises of any increases in State funding of education. In addition, due to tax limitation laws, we are not able to access the increased EAV. What can the State do to help us? It is simple: Remove the tax cap immediately Allow districts to fully access increase in EAV Remove all utility expenses from the tax cap Remove life safety from under the tax cap Support EFAB's recommendations  NORTH SHORE SD 112 NORTH WAMAC SCHOOL DISTRICT 186 NORTH WAYNE C U SCHOOL DIST 200 NORTHBROOK ELEM SCHOOL DIST 27  1.40 1.05 1.40 1.40  1.40 0.70 1.05 1.05  0.40 0.20 0.40 0.40  0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  0.30 0.30 0.40 0.40  3.90 2.65 3.65 3.65  Financial Recognition Financial Early Warning Financial Recognition Financial Recognition  Thursday, May 15, 2003  Page 59 of 83   District Name Max NORTHBROOK SCHOOL DIST 28 NORTHBROOK/GLENVIEW SCH DIST 30 NORTHFIELD TWP HIGH SCH DIST 225 NORTHWEST C U SCH DISTRICT 175  FBRR (1.4) 1.40 1.40 1.40 1.40  EXRV (1.4) 1.05 0.70 0.70 1.05  DCOH (0.4) 0.40 0.20 0.40 0.20  STB (0.4) 0.40 0.40 0.40 0.40  LTD (0.4) 0.40 0.30 0.40 0.40  Score (4.0) 3.65 3.00 3.30 3.45  Designation Financial Recognition Financial Early Warning Financial Review Financial Review  District Comments  On April 1, 2003, the Northwest CUSD 175 and the Colchester CUSD 180 will vote on a referendum to consolidate.

Some transportation and special education payments were received after July 1, 2002, and did not show up on the books for FY02. State aid payments in recent years have failed to keep pace with increasing labor and heating costs.

This enrollment drop has had a major financial impact upon the General State aid that the district receives. As a result the district made cuts totaling $126,726 in the spring of 01, $150,000 in the spring of 02 and will make cuts of $220,000 in the spring of 03. Falling assessed value of the district plus the inability of ISBE (state) to pay the promised amount of general state aid will result in serious future financial problems.

Maintaining this status in the future is going to be extremely difficult for the following reasons: 1) Changes in the poverty count of the 2000 Census will decrease the District's state and federal funding levels. 2) Decrease in student enrollment 3) Eroding local tax base due to the T.I.F. District and State land purchases. 4) The State of Illinois prorating payments. The District receives 61% of funding from state sources. As long as state aid payments increase the economic outlook appears healthy. However, the District is experiencing a declining student enrollment and a significant decrease in the poverty count as determined by the 2000 census. Depending on the poverty count the District could face between a $142,606 to $285,166 decrease in general state aid alone. Hopefully a hold harmless provision would decrease these amounts. Currently the State of Illinois has prorated special education and transportation funding costing the District $29,672 in revenue. There remains a question on state aid payments. Currently, unless legislators agree to fully fund state aid payments the best-case scenario is an additional $14,285 loss of state aid due to prorating. There is the possibility of creative state financing by sliding state aid payments into the next fiscal year. District #50 like many other Southern Illinois school districts will be faced with the task trying to do more with less. The uncertainty of funding levels makes it extremely difficult to plan for the future educational programming of Pinckneyville District #50.

District 88 will be asking voters to approve an education fund rate increase in the April 1, 2003 election. The increased education fund rate is projected to stabilize the District's education fund for the foreseeable future. There are residential developments currently pending within the District's boundaries that will increase future student enrollment in all schools. A cooperative ""Growth Committee"" between the City of Plano and District 88 has been organized to develop a plan that will accommodate these anticipated increases in student enrollment. Pleasant Hill CUSD 3 will continue to maintain a prudent and fiscally conservative approach to our fiduciary responsibilities. Pleasant Hill expects little change in enrollment or equalized assessed valuation. We will examine possible reductions in personnel and non essential programs. Field trips and some extra-curricular activities will need to be reduced. An eighty-five cent Education Fund increase will be voted on this spring. April 1, 2003 We received $407,586 in early tax distributions for the Education, Operation & Maintenance, and Transportation Funds. We also received $7500 in early tax distributions for the Working Cash Fund. (See below for changes to the Profile sheet brought about by this early tax distribution information.) These early tax distributions were reflected in fund balances for 2000-2001 when they were actually an early payment of revenue for 2001-2002. We spent $98,486 from the Operation & Maintenance Fund that was from accumulated School Maintenance Grant; so, actual expenditures would be $4,403,427. (See below for changes to the Profile sheet brought by this expenditure from the accumulated School Maintenance Grant) Incorporating these changes into the first three areas of the Profile changed the Revenue, Expenditure, and Fund Balance TOTALS; but, the SCORE or VALUE figures of areas 1 and 3 were not effected. In area 2 the SCORE increased from a 2 to a 3 and the VALUE increased from .70 to 1.05. Thus, the TOTAL PROFILE SCORE would be 3.35 instead of 3.00.

We, therefore, will continue to control spending as well as possible while finding creative means to meet the educational needs of our students. The financial condition of the Prairie du Rocher School District has been very sound over the past several years. Although student enrollment is down from what it once was in the early 1990's, it has remained fairly constant for the past four years.

Revised 3/13/03 The fact that Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District is now moving from ""Financial Review"" in the draft of FY01, to ""Financial Recognition"" for FY02, presents a false sense of positive revenue funds. Moving from an area that projects ""potential downward trends"" to the high rating of ""financial strength"" particularly when the fund balances reflect early local taxes, which show the financial stability of our district. Local officials look as if they are ""crying wolf"" when difficult decisions are being made to reduce local spending. Local constituents now will get the opinion we are not presenting a true picture of the financial state of the Prairie Hill Community Consolidated School District. All of these inconsistencies will affect this school district when we go to the district taxpayers for additional funds through referendum questions.

School District 209 has not been able to successfully pass an education fund tax rate increase in more than 33 years. In addition, tax adjustments made by the Cook County Assessor's office, have all worked to adversely impact District 209's ability to maintain revenues and expenditures in alignment.

District to district comparisons are complicated by financial reporting cash or accrual accounting methods. Queen Bee School District 16 reports on an accrual basis. Therefore, fund balances include $1,200,000 of accrued salaries (summer payrolls) and accrued compensated days thereby reducing fund balances. Adding those dollars back into the fund balances would increase the district score to 1.05 from .70 in area 1 and increasing the total profile score from 2.55 to 2.9 which would move this district from the ""Financial Watch"" determination to the ""Financial Early Warning"" determination. 2. Every school district in Illinois has a different ""story"" of financial status that is reflected in the new Financial Profile. While we believe this evaluation better reflects a district's financial picture than the ""Financial Watch"" formula did, it is important to understand that unique circumstances can cause elevated or exceptionally dismal scores. For example, a deficit budget could reflect a construction project as we did in FY2001 when funds from a lease purchase were deposited in our Operations and Maintenance Fund in FY2000 and the costs incurred in FY2001. This would skew both step 2 and step 3 of the profile. 3. Percent of long-term debt margin remaining: The district has no non-referendum bond ability remaining even though there is 46.4% debt margin remaining for the district. Legislative action could make these funds available for an emergency (i.e. life safety). This district currently has $6,000,000 of approved life safety amendments it is unable to proceed with until funds become available. At this time it is not feasible to request funds via referendum. Please see statement #4. 4. The district has an education fund tax rate referendum question on the April 1, 2003 ballot after the defeat of the November 2, 2002 referendum. Should it not be successful, the district is preparing to implement $1,5000,000 in staff salary and benefit reductions. The last successful referendum was in 1993.

This should bring in excess of $1,000,000 new dollars per year into the district. It should enable us to alleviate our deficit over the next two to more years. The District has existed for many years with a single administrator. As enrollment doubles in the next 3-5 years, an additional administrator will be necessary. This will increase the operating expense. It is hoped that increased EAV will offset the additional costs.

During the decade of the 1990's through 2002 the District was able to accumulate a reasonable fund balance in its operating funds. The healthy economy fueled appropriations to keep up with increased operational costs. Unfortunately, the economy has bottomed out. States are not able to provide appropriations to assist with increased operational costs. The District is feeling the impact of the economy through reduced revenues as interest rates plummet, grants are pro-rated to less than 100% and costs continue to rise. To meet this economic challenge, the District began reducing expenditures during the 2002-03 year. It will also minimize the loss of programming for students by utilizing part of the accumulated surplus. As the poor economic conditions continue, the District foresees that its ranking on the financial profile will diminish. Great care and thought will be given to determine the most appropriate means to provide learning opportunities to the students and providing value to our community while maintaining fiscal responsibility. These decisions are difficult but necessary until the economy turns and the State is able to provide adequate assistance to meet the educational needs of the students.

Due to business claiming bankruptcy and another proposing tax evaluation we expect a drop in our tax base. We are seeking an Education Fund tax rate increase of $.59 in the February 25, 2003 consolidated primary election and also have it on the April 1, 2003 consolidated general election should it fail on February 25, 2003. This tax increase is expected to increase revenues by $1.5 million in the Education Fund.

First, the State of Illinois was unable to meet its obligations in a timely manner. Our cash-basis budget was dependant upon receiving our fourth quarter categorical payments by June 30, 2002. This did not occur. Also, the tax bills for Lake County went out late, further eroding our revenue collections for FY02. Had these two separate events not occurred, our revenue would have been greater than our expenses and we would have had more cash on hand at year-end. This would have raised Wauconda CUSD 118's profile to the Financial Review category. Given that this assessment system is new, it should be noted that it could be unfairly influenced by uncontrollable acts from outside parties, especially for districts like ours who operate under a cash-basis accounting system.

We used accumulated fund balances (savings) to build a new Center for the Arts at our junior high. This project was saved for and built without having to go to a referendum. Revised 3/12/03 During the period of time being considered, the Board of Education built a new Center for the Arts and a new Early Childhood/Administrative Center. The total cost of these one time expenditures was $7.5 million. The Board entered into a lease-purchase agreement and received $2.5 million which was not recognized as revenue in the State Board of Education's formulas. These projects were planned for and built utilizing fund balances without a referendum or tax rate increase.

In addition, cash flow problems are occurring due to the lateness of categorical payments from the Illinois comptroller due to the State's financial problems. District 200 is committed to operating within its means and reductions of $1.25 million were made to the 2002-2003 operating budgets and $2.2 million are being considered for 2003-2004. The funding methods of education in Illinois are outdated, inconsistent, unreliable, inequitable for students and relies too heavily on local property taxes. The educational funding system is broken and needs to be repaired. Statesmanship and political leadership in Springfield will be necessary to make the necessary changes in the way education if funded in Illinois The EAV is expected to increase at a very low rate of 2.44%, based on historical data. This rate increase will not keep up with the costs of operating the school district. The annual enrollment is increasing at a minimal rate also. These two contributing factors, along with the State Aid formula will have detrimental effects on the district District #115 passed Education Fund and Building Fund referendums in the spring of 2002 in an effort to address our increased enrollment due to growth. Our Equalized Assessed Valuation is also increasing due to this growth. We had to increase our debt service to build the new buildings to house the additional students. We also have to hire additional staff to address increases in enrollment, further reducing our Education Fund balance.

The City of Zion was the home for a CommonWealth Edison nuclear power plant; this plant closed in 1997. After CommonWealth Edison made the decision to permanently close the plant in 1998 the affected taxing bodies worked with CommonWealth Edison to draft an Equalized Assessed Value (EAV) rampdown agreement. This ramp-down agreement, which was finalized in December 2000, decreased the EAV of the plant from $171,000,000 in tax year 199 to $10,000,000 in tax year 2005. This agreement resulted in a loss of 60% of our district's EAV, which directly affects the tax revenues of all funds. The District has taken steps to improve the financial health of the district, including a community-supported $.60 education fund tax rate increase in March 2002. While the education fund tax rate increase was an important step, it is necessary for the district to take further steps to ensure the financial solvency of the district.
