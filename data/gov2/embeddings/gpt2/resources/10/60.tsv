The Gimp includes (among many other things) a wide variety of scripts for automatically generating logos. I used the ""Neon"" script, with the ""Blippo"" font and a pure green (RGB = 0.00, 1.00, 0.00) glow color. I then flattened the resulting multi-layered images and saved them as jpeg and as gif."
