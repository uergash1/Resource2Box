GX015-32-13860313	[DOP Brochure]    [Subsidence]    [Historical Images]     History    The State of California granted the City its tidelands properties in the early 1900's for development of commerce, navigation, and recreation.   When oil was discovered in adjacent lands in the 1930's, the City realized it needed to protect its assets.    In 1939, the Harbor Department created a Petroleum Division to  provide technical assistance and advice to the Harbor Commission on all matters pertaining to oil operations in the Harbor District.  It ensured compliance with operating agreements and the use of sound engineering in oil field practices.    In 1958, as a result of the devastating effects of subsidence during the 1940's and 1950's, the Harbor Department created a Subsidence Control Division to manage subsidence control and prevention.  These divisions were combined into the Petroleum and Subsidence Control Division in 1960.    The City Council created the Petroleum Properties Administration in 1962 to oversee all oil operations outside the Harbor District.   The DOP, which supplanted both organizations through City Charter Amendment in 1965, coordinates all oil operations and subsidence control activities throughout the entire City.  The DOP is composed of approximately thirty-six City employees.   Most of the twenty engineers, geologists and managers, hold advanced degrees and/or California professional licenses.  The average experience level per employee exceeds 20 years in engineering, geology and subsidence control.

GX119-81-0492659	STATEMENT OF P. DANIEL SMITH, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BEFORE THE HOUSE RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL PARKS, RECREATION AND PUBLIC LANDS, ON H.R. 1521, A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL LANDS TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.         June 24, 2003                 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of the Interior on H.R. 1521, a bill to provide for additional lands to be included within the boundary of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in the State of Pennsylvania.            The bill would add seven parcels of land to the boundary of the park to provide permanent protection for resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.    Six of the parcels, totaling 2.33 acres, are approximately three miles from the park in the  village  of  Saint Michael  where the former South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was located.    The seventh parcel, comprising approximately 12 acres, is adjacent to the current boundary.    Recently, a property owner of a 0.18-acre parcel has indicated that he does not wish to sell his property.    We ask the Committee to amend the map reference in the bill to reflect this change of only six parcels being added to the park.    Land acquisition costs for these six parcels are approximately $805,000.    All parcels are for sale by willing sellers.         The Department supports the President’s Initiative to address the deferred maintenance backlog and taking care of our current responsibilities.    In this instance, we are faced with a unique situation concerning this boundary adjustment.    The historic structures central to this acquisition have always been considered key components of the park, but were to be protected, maintained, and interpreted through a public-private partnership.    However, the partner can no longer perform this function, based on financial problems.    For this reason, the Department believes it is appropriate to move forward with this bill at this time.            Johnstown Flood National Memorial comprises nearly 165 acres in western  Pennsylvania .    The park’s mission is to tell the stories of the events leading up to the  Johnstown  flood, of the flood itself, and of its effects on  Johnstown  and the nation.    The addition of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club properties would significantly increase the park’s capability to interpret the important events surrounding the  Johnstown  flood and the individuals associated with it.           On May 31, 1889, a poorly maintained earthen dam breeched, sending 20 million tons of water down the Little Conemaugh Valley into Johnstown and other surrounding communities.     A 36-foot wall of water rolled over the town at 40 miles per hour, flattening houses, trees, locomotives, and everything else in its path.    By the disaster’s end, 2,209 people had perished in the flood, another 40 died in the weeks after from typhoid, and property damage was estimated at $17 million.    It was the worst inland flood in the nation’s history and the first test of the newly formed American Red Cross, headed up by Clara Barton.         A pivotal part of the story revolves around the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, located in Saint Michael, which in 1879 had purchased an abandoned reservoir, repaired the old dam, and created a private lake and recreational area for its members.     Because the dam was not properly constructed or maintained, it gave way after heavy rains pounded the area, overtaxing the Lake Conemaugh dam spillway and eventually causing the dam to fail.            In 1986, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the state level of significance.            In 1989, the Park Service and residents of Saint Michael undertook a joint planning effort, which produced the  Preservation and Interpretation Plan for the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District.    This plan outlined concepts and guidance for basic visitor services, interpretation, cultural resource preservation and maintenance.    As a result of the plan, there developed a structured partnership between the village of Saint Michael and the Park Service, designed to protect, maintain and manage the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club clubhouse and other significant cottages in the historic district.    The 1889 South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historical Preservation Society was formed to be the principal community body working with the Park Service in the implementation of the plan.    Since the original planning efforts, the Society has obtained ownership of the Clubhouse, the Annex, the Moorehead Cottage, and the Brown Cottage.    These properties were not originally included within the boundary of the park because it was understood that a local entity could adequately provide for their protection and interpretation.         Unfortunately, the Society lacks the resources to continue to maintain the properties they own, let alone preserve and develop them according to approved plans.    The Society is struggling to make mortgage payments, and while they are desperately seeking a solution, the properties are deteriorating and losing historic integrity.    In 2000, the Society worked with a private, non-profit historic property development company to try and obtain private sector interest in purchasing the properties, but was not successful.    There is an imminent threat to the protection of these resources.    The private owner has already listed these historic structures and properties for sale on the open market.         In 2001, the National Park Service completed a special resource study and environmental assessment to evaluate options for protection and interpretation of the additional parcels of land.    Based upon the report, the Park Service proposed to add these parcels of land to the boundary of the park and to acquire the parcels in fee simple.    Within the village of Saint Michael, four historically significant properties would be acquired.    These structures include the former clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, the Clubhouse Annex, and two cottages built by club members.    One undeveloped parcel, the Clubhouse Side-yard that sits between the Clubhouse and the Clubhouse Annex, would also be added.    The final parcel would protect the historic viewshed of the park, preserving the rural character of the Unger House property (Elias Unger was president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club), owned by the National Park Service.         If the Park Service acquired the historic buildings, we would explore the option of a public-private partnership to lease the buildings to the private sector for commercial and residential use. Through our historic leasing program, the private sector could sign a long-term lease with the Park Service that would cover a portion of the operations and maintenance costs of the properties, which ranges from $75,000 to $310,000.    In addition, the private sector could rehabilitate the buildings, estimated to cost upwards of $2.9 million, using private funds in return for federal historic preservation tax credits.    This would decrease the financial burden placed on the Park Service by the addition of these properties to the park. There has already been interest expressed by local businesses in this proposal.         The proposal to add these properties to the boundary of the park has widespread support among the property owners, state and local governments, and the public who attended a public meeting in July 2001 in Saint Michael.    Public comments received were unanimous in support of the proposal.         We look forward to working with the local communities in Saint Michael and Johnstown to acquire these historically significant properties that will help tell the entire story of the events of the 1889 Johnstown Flood, from the actions leading up to the flood through its devastating aftermath.         Thank you for the opportunity to comment.    This concludes my prepared remarks.    I would be glad to answer any que stions that you or the members of the committee may have.

As a ""short form"" charter, it sets forth the institutions and processes of the City's political system and defines the authority and responsibilities of elected officials --the Mayor, Council, Comptroller, Borough Presidents, and Public Advocate --and City agencies in broad strokes, while leaving the details of operation to local law and agency rulemaking. Unlike the United States  Constitution, which is amended rarely, the City's Charter is a fluid document that is amended often. Indeed, while the U.S. Constitution has been amended only 27 times in its 215 year history, the Charter has been amended more than 100 times since 1989. In the United States, city governments receive their legal authority from the states in which they are located. In the State of New York, municipalities have broad authority to structure how they operate by virtue of the Home Rule provisions of the State Constitution and the Municipal Home Rule Law. The City's Charter, along with the State Constitution, the Municipal Home Rule Law and other State statutes, provides the legal framework within which it may conduct its affairs. Under State law, charter revision may occur as an ongoing process through the passage of local laws. There are limitations on that authority;  however; for example, there can be no curtailment of powers of an elected  -1-   official. A charter can also be revised pursuant to a State or City charter revision commission, which has the authority to put proposals before the voters. A  charter revision commission may put proposals before the voters regarding all elements of a charter, including the curtailment of powers of an elected official, as well as provisions that could also be adopted through loca l law. Municipal Home Rule Law (""MHRL"")  36(4) permits the Mayor to establish a ""charter commission"" in New York City. The composition of a mayoral charter  commission must consist of nine to fifteen members. The members must be City residents and may hold other public offices or employment. The Mayor  designates the chair, vice-chair and secretary of the commission pursuant to MHRL  36(4) and (6)(d). Charter commissions are not permanent commissions. MHRL  36(6)(e) limits the term of a charter commi ssion. A commission expires on the day of the election at which a proposed new charter or amendments prepared by a commission are submitted to the voters. However, if a commission fails to  submit a new charter or any amendments to the voters, the commission expires on the day of the second general election following the commission's creation. There are no prohibitions against the reappointment of a commission or appointment of a new commission upon the expiration of an existing commission. A charter commission may propose a broad set of amendments that essentially ""overhauls"" the entire charter, or may narrowly focus upon certain areas and explain why such an approach is preferable in a report to the public. MHRL  36(5)(a); see Matter of Cruz v. Deierlein, 84 N.Y.2d 890, 892-893  -2-   (1994). The proposed amendments must be consistent with general State laws and can only effect changes that are otherwise within the City's local legislative powers as set forth in the State Constitution and the MHRL. The proposed amendments must be filed with the City Clerk for action by the voters no later than the second general election after the commission's creation, and must be voted on at a general or special election held at least sixty days after the filing. The proposed amendments may be submitted to voters as one question, or a series of questions or alternatives. MHRL  36(5)(b). The Commission's Membership In July 2002, Mayor Michael R.

He has served on the legal staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. He has extensive City legal experi ence and has served in executive level capacities at the Loft Board. He has also been a Legal Aid attorney. Other members of the staff are from the City's Law Department (which is a professional, independent law office that has represented, among others , the Mayor, the Public Advocate, the Comptroller, and the City Council), the Departments of Finance and Probation, the Business Integrity and Anti Corruption Commission and the Mayor's Office. They include: Deputy General Counsel Elisabeth Palladino; Special Counsels Dara Jaffee and Florence Hutner; Assistant General Counsels Mark Tyler and Coleen Chin; Research Director -9-   Anne Fitzgibbon; Analyst Talya Sheinkman, and Administrative Aides Renee Wortham, Ivonne Sierra and Oscar Camacho. Most of these staff members served on the staffs of the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions. PROPOSALS This report summarizes proposals and issues presented to the Commission by City agencies the public for review and possible inclusion on the ballot. Under separate cover, the staff has also presented the Commission with proposals and issues reviewed by the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions that were ultimately deferred for study by future Commissions. As the Commission reviews these sets of proposals and issues, the staff will accordingly summarize for the Commission all new City agency and public proposals as they are submitted.  CITY AGENCY SUBMISSIONS DEPARTMENT OF BUILDINGS  Clarify DOB's Subpoena Power  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify the Department of Building's (""DOB"") subpoena power so that it is not limited only to cases ""where the public safety is involved""? Relevant Charter Provision:  646. Discussion: Charter  646 provides that the Buildings Commissioner ""shall have the power and duty to conduct such inquiries as may assist him in the performance of the functions of the department where the public safety is  - 10 -   involved and for such purpose he shall have subpoena power to compel the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths, examine witnesses and to compel the production of books, papers and documents."" The Department of Buildings has proposed removing the requirement that the subpoena power be available to the Commissioner only when performing the functions of the Department that involve public safety. Under the current Charter provision, subpoenaed parties have questioned DOB's authority to demand certain records which, on their face, do not appear to relate to public safety. For example, the Department's Investigations and Discipline Unit may seek to subpoena the telephone records of a contractor or professional in the course of an investigation. While this may not at first appear to be a public safety issue, where the underlying investigation concerns unsafe or illegal work, t here may in fact be important public safety issues and concerns that exist. To address such concerns, DOB has proposed removing the public safety limitation to allow it to perform its investigations without unnecessary delay and without being subject to legal challenges concerning subpoena authority.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BOARD  Assured Funding  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to assure funding for COIB? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602.  - 11 -   Discussion: The City's Conflicts of Interest Board (""COIB ""), established in Charter Chapter 68, proposes that its independence be established explicitly in the Charter by providing for an assured source of funding. As an independent ethics agency, COIB has no natural constituency and no source of revenue. This position is complicated by the fact that it regulates the very people who set its budget. Thus, it could be argued that COIB's continued survival requires a source of assured financing. There are several options to be considered that could provide assured funding. One possibility is making the agency self-funding, for example, by  charging all 12,000 financial disclosure filers a filing fee or by requiring short form disclosure by all 300,000 public servants, accompanied by a nominal filing fee. The Ohio Ethics Commission receives substantial funds in this manner, although most of the filing fees are paid by the filer's agency. Another possibility is a guaranteed minimum budget. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the board during each fiscal year shall not be less than six one thousandths of one percent of the net total expense budget of the city."" See the provisions for the  Independent Budget Office (Charter  259(b)), whose budget must be at least 10% of the budget of the Office of Management and Budget. See also Mich. Const. art. xi,  5 (requiring that the legislature appropriate to the Michigan Civil Service Commission ""a sum not less than one percent of the aggregate payroll of the classified ser vice for the preceding fiscal year""). Under that proposal, every billion-dollar decrease in the City's budget would decrease the Board's budget by  - 12 -   $60,000; and the City's Fiscal Year 2003 budget would yield a COIB budget of about $2.5 million. Another for m of a guaranteed budget could provide a specific amount, adjusted for inflation. Such a provision might read: ""The appropriations available to pay for the expenses of the conflicts of interest board during each fiscal year shall not be less than two million five hundred thousand dollars, which amount shall be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics."" The adjustment language in that alte rnative provision is taken from current Charter  2603(a) (adjustment to threshold for ""ownership interest""). See, e.g., Calif. Gov't Code  83122 (guaranteeing a budget of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1975-1976, adjusted for cost-of-living changes during each fiscal year thereafter, for the California Fair Political Practices Commission). COIB argues that such an increase in its budget, prudently spent, could cover the additional responsibilities given to the Board under Charter amendments presently being considered by the Board. It should be emphasized that such a provision would set only a guaranteed minimum budget; the City could adopt a larger budget for the Board in any particular year. Likely, the most desirable option for COIB would be an option that provides for submission of the Board's proposed budget to the Council, without amendment by the administration. This proposal is identical to the budget scheme adopted for the Campaign Finance Board in Charter  1052(12)(c), with the addition of a provision governing mid-year modifications to the Board's budget. The Board's  - 13 -   proposed budget would be public and any reductions would require affirmative action, reducing the likelihood of ill-advised cuts, while preserving the budget authority established b y Chapter 10 of the Charter.  The COIB Member Nomination Process  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give the City Council and the Mayor more parity in the nomination process for the members of the Conflicts of Interest Board? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: To further insure impartiality and independence COIB has  addressed the issue that the City Council and the Mayor have greater parity in the nomination process for the members of the Conflicts of Interest Board. Presently the Mayor appoints the five members of the Board ""with the advice and consent of the council"" ( 2602 (a)). It should be noted that the former Council Speaker had recommended that the Council make some of the appointments to the Board. However, split  appointments  some by the mayor and some by the Council - present the danger of politicizing Board appointments and undermining accountability, a charge often leveled at the Board of Education prior to the recent amendments, largely as a result of its split appointment process. As an alternative, appointments could be made only upon the recommendation of an independent body, similar to a judicial screening committee. For example, commissioners of the Hawaii State Ethics Commission are appointed by the governor from a panel of ten persons nominated by the judicial council, an  - 14 -   advisory body appointed by the Hawaii Supreme Court.  See Hawaii Revised  Statutes  84-21(a) and 601-4. Such a screening committee could be established for appointments to the Board and to other similar non-mayoral boards and commissions; the members of such a body could be appointed by each citywide elected official (mayor, speaker, comptroller, and public advocate), perhaps with two mayoral appointments, one of whom would be the chair of the committee. Clarifying Amendments .  COIB Clarifying Amendments  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify that (1) a COIB member can act as lobbyist on his or her behalf before the City; and (2) the staff director should be known as the executive director instead of counsel? Relevant Charter Provision:  2602. Discussion: COIB proposes that the Charter  2602(b) be amended to clarify  that a Board member cannot act as a paid lobbyist on behalf of someone else but may act as a lobbyist on his or her own behalf, but not before the Board in violation of  2604(b)(6). COIB also proposes that the term ""counsel,"" which was carried over to COIB from its predecessor, the Board of Ethics, be replaced with the term ""executive director,"" as the person who shall serve as the staff director. First, the amendment reflects that the size and mission of the Conflicts of Interest Board are larger than that of the Board of Ethics. Second, it gives the Board the freedom to hire a qualified non-lawyer for the p osition of executive director.  - 15 -   DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE  Uniform Right to Appeal from Determinations of the Tax Appeals Tribunal Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit appeals from the tax appeals tribunal by both the taxpayers and the Commissioner o f Finance? Relevant Charter Provision:  171. Discussion: Charter  168 provides for an independent Tax Appeals Tribunal within the Department of Finance. The Charter specifies that the ""powers, functions, duties and obligations of the tribunal shall be separate from and independent of the authority of the commissioner of finance."" The Charter establishes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting notices issued by the Finance Commissioner for which taxpayers have the right to a hearing, including ""any notice of determination of a tax due, a tax deficiency, of a denial of a refund or credit application"" that relate to excise taxes, vault charges and taxes other than taxes on real property s uch as the City's business taxes. Charter 171 provides that decisions of the Tribunal are final and specifies that such Tribunal decisions are subject to judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, this right to judicial review is inequitably afforded only to the taxpayer and not to the Commissioner of Finance. Specifically, Charter 171(b) provides that ""each decision of the tribunal, shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues raised in the proceedings before it, unless the petitioner who commenced the proceeding  - 16 -   seeks judicial review of any such decision in the manner provided in article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision."" (emphasis added). Because the Charter specifies that the opportunity to appeal is limited to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, which in such proceedings is the taxpayer, the City is left without any opportunity to challenge decisions of the ind ependent tribunal. As the Tribunal is an independent entity, in order to ensure fairness, both parties should have the same right to appeal. The ability to appeal such decisions is necessary for the Department of Finance to fairly administer and properly implement the City's tax laws on behalf of the many taxpayers of the City of New York. To remedy this inequity, the Department of Finance has proposed amending Charter 171 to provide that both the Commissioner of Finance as well as the petitioner may seek judicial review of determinations. It is important to note that when the voters originally approved the creation of the Tax Appeals Tribunal to hear City excise tax appeals in the 1988 referendum, Charter 171 as approved explicitly permitted both the  Commissioner of Finance and the taxpayer to appeal tribunal decisions. In 1992, however, when the Tribunal's jurisdiction was expanded to include City business taxes, Charter 171 was legislatively amended to limit the right to appeal to the petitioner who commenced the proceeding, thus preventing the Commissioner of Finance from appealing Tribunal determinations (Ch. 808 L. 1992). This inequity prevents the City of New York from adequately defending the interests of all the City's taxpayers. Therefore, it is proposed that Charter 171 be amended to  - 17 -   allow the Commissioner of Finance to also appeal determinations of the independent Tribunal.  Administration and Enforcement of the Payment made by NonResident City Employees as a Condition of City Employment Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to the administration and enforcement of the payment that nonresident City employees make as a condition of their employment? Relevant Charter Provision:  1127. Discussion: Charter  1127 provides in relevant part that ""every person seeking employment with the city of New York or any of its agencies regardless of civil service classification or status shall sign an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to the effect that if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual . . . during employment by the city, such person will pay to the city an amount by which a city personal income tax on residents computed and determined as if such person were a resident individual, as defined in such section, during such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period.""1 This amount is not a tax but a contractual obligation from which the City derived more than $60 million in revenue under this provision in 2001. Since the Department of Finance has administered the  1127 program, it has been the subject of much debate, confusion and litigation in a number of areas including its applicability to certain classes of public servants. Thus, the 1  Added by Local Law No. 2 of 1973, employees hired prior to and continuously employed since January 4, 1973 are exempted.  - 18 -   Department has requested the Commission determine whether a clarification of this section of the Charter is necessary regarding its application and enforcement.  DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE  Establish a Consistent Uniform Maximum Penalty for the  Enforcement of Violations of the Various Public Health Laws Issue: Should the Charter be amended to establish a consistent uniform  maximum penalty for violations of the various public health laws and regulations by increasing from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum penalty that may be imposed by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene for the violation of any provision of Chapter 22 of the Charter or any notice, order or regulation issued pursuant such provision? Relevant Charter Provision:  555(b)(2). Discussion: There does not currently exist a consistent uniform maximum  penalty applicable to the various provisions of law enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene. Pursuant to  12(1) of the New York State Publi c Health, violations of the New York State Sanitary Code, much of which is enforced in the City by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, may be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of two thousand dollars. Pursuant to Section 3.12(a) of the New York City Health Code, as amended by a resolution of the Board of Health on April 26, 1994, violations of the New York City Health  - 19 -   Code may also be penalized by fines up to a maximum amount of two thousand dollars. However, Charter 555(b)(2) provides that the regulations promulgated by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene to implement requirements found in the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code can only be enforced by penalties of up to one thousand dollars. The regulations of the  Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, which currently number more than twenty, are contained in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York and relate to subjects as varied as window guard enforcement, enforcement of the Smoke Free Air Act and mobile food vendor regulation. To remedy this problem of not having a consistent uniform maximum penalty applicable to the various laws and regulations enforced by the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has proposed amending Charter  555(b)(2) to increase from $1,000 to $2,000 the maximum amount which may be imposed for the violation of regulations promulgated by the Commissioner to implement requirements of the Charter and the New York City Administrative Code. The $1,000 maximum has been in effect since 1977 (Local Law 25 of 1977).  - 20 -   DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT  Deputy Commissioners  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide HPD the authority to appoint deputy commissioners as needed? Relevant Charter Provision:  1801. Discussion: Charter  1801 limits to five the number of deputy commissioners that may be appointed at HPD. HPD proposes that the language be made less limiting to reflect the flexibility needed to operate a large agency with many discrete functions. HPD would like to appoint deputy commissioners ""as may be necessary.""  Jurisdiction  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify HPD's jurisdiction? Relevant Charter Provision:  1802. Discussion: Charter  1802(3) gives HPD ""all powers, rights and duties as provided by any federal, state or local law or resolution, relating to slum clearance . . . urban renewal . . . (and) public housing."" HPD proposes that its Charter language be clarified by cross -referencing specifically General Municipal Law Article 16 which authorizes HPD to sell property, make loans and grant tax exemptions. HPD also requests clarification in the Charter concerning its authority to administer tax exemption and abatement programs. Presently, Charter  1802 (6)(b) authorizes HPD to administer these programs pursuant to the following language:  - 21 -   ""administer laws authorizing tax exemption or tax abatement or both, including but not limited to, section 11 -243 of the administrative code of the city of New York and section four hundred twenty one of the real property tax law [RPTL], which are in aid of construction, rehabilitation, alteration or improvement of residential buildings and structures . . ."" HPD would like the specific references to RPTL  421 and Administrative Code  11-243 removed because they no longer reflect accurately HPD's authority and obligations regarding tax incentive programs. First, the reference to RPTL  421 is erroneous because that section is now blank. Second, HPD's authority to administer tax programs has expanded beyond Administrative Code  11-243; HPD now administers tax programs set forth in Administrative Code  11-241 through 11-245. HPD would like to  replace the inaccurate and outdated references with broad, open-ended, language regarding its mandate to administer tax programs generally that would permit HPD to create and administer new tax incentive programs as needed. Additionally, HPD proposes that Charter 1802 specifically state that HPD may administer loan programs.  Reducing Approval Requirements for Small Emergency Purchases  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt small purchases, which are also emergency purchases, from approval by the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller? Relevant Charter Provision:  315. Discussion: Charter Chapter 13 governs procurement. Section 315 provides for ""[e]mergency procurement"" and requires approval for emergency purchases from  - 22 -   the Comptroller and Corporation Counsel regardless of t he dollar amount at stake. HPD proposes to eliminate the requirement for approval by the  Comptroller and the Corporation Counsel in situations involving small dollar amounts. The dollar amount threshold for small purchases is established by the Procureme nt Policy Board (""PPB"") pursuant to Charter  314. The current small purchase limit is $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services, $100,000 for construction and construction-related services and information technology. Presently, the Charter requires approval from the Corporation Counsel and the Comptroller for all emergency purchases. HPD's proposal would  authorize PPB to establish small emergency purchase rules eliminating the current approval requirement and making it apply only in specific circumstances, such as for purchases that do not exceed the small purchase limits.  2  Clarifying that the Requirement to Obtain an Appraisal for the Disposition of Real Property is Limited in its Scope  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to clarify specifically when appraisals are required as a predicate to disposition of city property? Relevant Charter Provision:  384. Discussion: Presently, Charter Chapter 15, entitled Property of the City  provides for section 384 reads as follows: ""Disposal of the property of the City. a. No real property of the city may be sold, leased, exchanged or otherwise disposed of 2  HPD has submitted the text of what it states that ""[e]mergency purchases shall be made except that the appro val of the Comptroller emergency purchases which are less than or that the rule worked well, but was repealed by  is a former PPB rule: Section 3-08(i) once provided in accordance with Section 3-06 of these Rules, and the Corporation Counsel is not required for equal to the small purchase limits."" HPD contends Charter  315.  - 23 -   except with the approval of the mayor and as may be provided by law unless such power is expressly vested by law in another agency. b. Except as otherwise specifically provided by law: . . . 3. Real property of the city may be sold only after appraisal made within six months prior to the authorization of the sale and after a review of such appraisal by the department of citywide services within thirty days prior to the authorization of the sale, provided that advertisement for the public auction for such sale shall be commenced within sixty days of such authorization."" HPD finds the provision ambiguous because the final clause of subsection ""3,"" quoted above, appears to limit the provision to auction sales. However, the provision may be read as a general requirement. HPD seeks language that would eliminate the ambiguity. HPD presents a proposed amendment to  384 which clarifies that the provision does not create a general requirement for an appraisal. The new language makes clear that only in instances where the  property is disposed of by auction, pursuant to the provision itself, is an appraisal required. HPD no longer disposes of property pursuant to Charter  384. The proposed change would make clear that HPD is not required to obtain a prior appraisal in all circumstances.  - 24 -     Updating Provisions Relating to the Prohibition of Certain City Employees from Participating in Public Auction, Sealed Bid, and Negotiated Sales of City -Owned Real Property  Issue:  Should the Charter be amended to (1) make clarifying amendments  reflecting accurately the administrative structure of HPD and (2) prohibit employees of another division of HPD from participating in negotiated sales of City-owned residential buildings containing six or less dwelling units if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property? Relevant Charter Provisions:  2604(c). Discussion: Charter  2604 relates to the Conflicts of Interest and imposes various restrictions on the activities of City employees. Section 2604(c)(7)  prohibits certain City employees from bidding on and purchasing City-owned real property at a public auction or sealed bid sale, purchasing any City-owned residential building containing six or less dwelling units through a negotiated sale, if such employees participated in decisions affecting the property. HPD suggests a division of HPD, the Office of Development, be added to the groups of employees prohibited from participating in negotiated sales because that division handles such transactions. Furthermore, the reference to HPD's Office of Property Management (""OPM"") relating to auctions or sealed bids in  2604(c)(7) is outdated and should be omitted becaus e OPM no longer exists and the auction sales program it administered was discontinued a decade ago.  - 25 -   HPD also recommends that this prohibition regarding negotiated sales be separated from the prohibition relating to buying City-owned property at a public auction or sealed bid sale in  2604(c)(7) and moved to its own separate section succeeding the public auction/sealed bid section.  Demolition of Buildings Pursuant to DOB Emergency Orders  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Departme nt of Design and Construction (""DDC"") to perform demolitions and related actions in response to Department of Buildings (""DOB"") emergency orders? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1202(a). Discussion: Currently, HPD or the Department of Citywide Administra tive Services (""DCAS"") may demolish buildings pursuant to the precept process. In that process DOB notifies a landlord of the hazardous condition(s) and a survey is conducted and presented at court. The court then determines the remedial action to be taken which may include demolition. DOB also can issue  emergency orders to mandate the immediate demolition of a building. Although there are currently no provisions that identify the agency responsible for such demolition in an emergency situation, HPD ha s effectively taken the sole responsibility for such demolitions despite their complicated nature. DDC,  however, which is responsible for street, sewer, water main and most nonhousing building construction, funded by the capital budget, has more archite ctural expertise and technical skills to demolish buildings on an emergency basis, particularly with regard to buildings with complex structures. Because DDC has greater expertise than HPD in this area, HPD contends it  - 26 -   would be more efficient for DDC to be authorized to handle these demolitions. In order to recoup the costs of this demolition, HPD recommends that the DDC Commissioner be permitted to impose and collect charges for the work, and file liens for these costs.  DEPARTMENT OF INVESTIGATION (""DOI"") Issue: Should the Charter be amended to incorporate and expand the  provisions of the City's Whistleblower Law to protect all City employees, including employees of quasi- municipal agencies? Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 49. Discussion: The City's Whistleblower Law is codified at Administrative Code  12-113 and prohibits certain City agencies from taking an adverse retaliatory personnel action against an officer or employee who reports information to DOI concerning conduct which he or she knows or reasonably believes to involve corrupt or criminal activity or a conflict of interest. The law is limited in its applicability to officers or employees of ""an agency of the city, the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor."" Thus, employees of the Comptroller, the Borough Presidents, the City Council, the Public Advocate or any quasi-City agency such as the Economic Development Corporation (""EDC""), the Housing Development Corporation (""HDC""), Off- Track Betting Corporation (""OTB""), and Business Improvement Districts (""BIDs""), are not afforded whistleblower protection under City law. However, all City  employees play an essential role in providing information about fraud, corruption  - 27 -   and mismanagement, including those who work in the offices of elected officials, as well as those who work in government-created entities that perform municipal functions. Accordingly, DOI proposes that the Commission amend the current law and recodify it in the Charter. First, DOI proposes that the requirement tha t covered individuals be employed by an agency of the City, ""the head or members of which are appointed by the mayor,"" be deleted, and that the term ""agency"" be expanded to include not only mayoral agencies, but also the offices of elected officials and quasi-City agencies, including BIDs. Second, DOI proposes that the scope of the type of information that may be reported (e.g., criminal activity, etc.) by an individual that would enable him or her to claim whistleblower protection be expanded to include ""gross mismanagement"" and ""abuse of authority"" in order to conform the scope of whistleblower protections found in Executive Order 78 of 1984. Finally, DOI suggests that its proposals be recodified in Charter Chapter 49 because that chapter includes several provisions relating to employee integrity. In particular, Charter  1116, inter alia, makes fraud by a council member, officer, or employee of the City a misdemeanor and bars anyone convicted from office or employment, and Charter  1128 prohibits inte rference with any investigation pursuant to the Charter and demands full cooperation with DOI by every officer and employee of the City.  - 28 -   OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRIALS AND HEARINGS The Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (""OATH"") was establishe d by Executive Order No. 32 in 1979, and was codified in Charter Chapter 45-A by the 1989 Charter revision. As stated in Mayor Koch's  memorandum accompanying the executive order, administrative trials in the City had previously ""too often been characterized by procedural shortcomings and inconsistent, judicially reversible results."" The Mayor's goal, therefore, was to establish OATH as a centralized tribunal, in order ""to reform the due process trial system."" As an alternative to litigation, administrati ve trials are invaluable as a means of dispute resolution, because they provide, in comparison to litigation in court, a relatively quick and simple means of resolving disputes. See generally ""Alternative Dispute Resolution: Panacea or Anathema?"" 99 Harv. L. Rev. 668 (1986). The keys to OATH's structure are its impartiality and independence. In Executive Order No. 32, Mayor Koch mandated that all of OATH's administrative law judges (""ALJs"") ""maintain the standard of, and preside over administrative trials and hearings in accordance with the Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct of the American Bar Association adopted."" OATH was made a Charter agency pursuant to the 1989 Charter revision. Part of that Charter Revision Commission's goal was to establish OATH as ""an independent adjudicative body that can be a resource to agencies conducting their adjudications, while at the same time establishing an independent structure outside of the agency to provide  - 29 -   an unbiased assessment of the matters to be adjudicate d."" Report of the Charter Revision Commission, Vol. 2 at p. 103 (April 1989). Since that time, OATH has become an integral part of City government. It hears over 2,000 cases per year, on behalf of numerous mayoral and nonmayoral agencies. In most cases, OATH prepares findings of fact plus a The agency  recommendation as to the proper determination of the case.  involved in the adjudication then determines whether to accept, reject, or modify the recommendation. The agency's determination is subject to challenge in court under Article 78 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules. In addition to the obvious value that OATH's role plays in City government, perhaps one measure of its success is that many agencies have chosen to hold their administrative trials and hearings at OATH. Despite its success, OATH's experience has shown that its current Charter provisions may not give it the administrative flexibility it requires to best serve the needs of the City's agencies and employees. Therefore, OATH has proposed, for the Commission's consideration, a number of changes to Chapter 45-A that would enable this flexibility. Issue: Should the Charter be amended to provide OATH with administrative flexibility to allow it to best serve the needs of the City? Relevant C harter Provisions: Chapter 45-A. Discussion: Under Charter 1049(1), each OATH ALJ must be an attorney admitted to practice in New York State for at least five years. In addition, each ALJ is appointed for a term of five years, and is removable only for cause after  - 30 -   notice and an opportunity to be heard. These provisions help ensure the quality and independence of the ALJs. The five - year term, in particular, helps ensure independence, because it shields the ALJs from immediate retribution for unpopular findings or recommendations. However, the five - year term also has limited the administration of OATH, perhaps in unnecessary ways. OATH has submitted two major proposals regarding the five - year term. The first is to allow the Chief ALJ to appoint temporary ALJs (who would not have the fixed term), in addition to the staff of full- time ALJs. In addition to the Chief and the Deputy Chief, OATH currently has eight ALJs hearing cases. Because this is not a large corps of ALJs, any temporary drop in staffing (e.g. sick leave or maternity leave), results in an assignment of new cases and redistribution of older cases that has a relatively large impact on the remaining ALJs. These temporary problems could be efficiently dealt with if the Chief ALJ had the ability to appoint temporary ALJs to handle these uncovered cases. Furthermore, the ability to appoint temporary ALJs would allow OATH to more efficiently handle unexpected or seasonal influxes of cases. For example, the City, State, and Board of Education are currently considering whether OATH should hear certain Board cases involving special education. Should OATH be designated to hear these cases, its caseload would more than double and there would be a particularly difficult seasonal spike in the late spring and summer. Considering the importance of these cases and the need to resolve them within a short period of time, the ability to hire temporary ALJs is crucial.  - 31 -   OATH's other proposal regarding the five - year term involves creating a one- year term to which a newly appointed ALJ would be appointed, followed by an appointment to the five - year term. While an ALJ, in either type of term, would be removable only for cause, creation of an initial one - year term would allow OATH to determine, based on actual experience with the work of the new ALJ, whether his or her work was of sufficiently high caliber to merit reappointment. This process of an initial one - year term, with subsequent longer terms, is presently used by the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law, New Jersey's central administrative hearings office. 3  When OATH was established, Executive Order No. 32 required that OATH's Administrative Law Judges comply with the Canons of Judicial Conduct. While OATH's judges adhere currently to the highest evels of ethical judicial l conduct, OATH requests that this requirement be codified symbolically in the Charter. Finally, OATH requests that the Charter provision which establishes its adjudicatory standard be more clearly stated. Presently the provision governing its adjudicatory standards (Chapter 45-A,  1049 (2)) references OATH's adjudicatory standard as that contained in Chapter 45 of the Charter. That Chapter contains the entire City Administrative Procedures Act (""CAPA""). Within Chapter 45 is section 1146 which governs adjudication standards. OATH  requests that the specific section regarding adjudication be the reference rather than all of CAPA.  3  See New Jersey Permanent Statutes, Title 52, Section 52:14F- 4.  - 32 -   DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION  Retention of Funds Generated by Fees, Permits, Environmental Control Board (""ECB"") Penalties, and Litigation Regarding Tree Damage Issue: Should the Charter be amended to permit the Parks Department (""Parks"") to deposit into a Parks account rather than the City's General Fund the following: 1) concession fees and special events payments; and 2) money collected from penalties resulting from ECB summonses for violations of Parks rules and affirmative litigation awards regarding tree damage or similar cases? Relevant Charter Provision:  109. Discussion: The operation of concession services and special events requires a significant amount of management. In addition, the operation of special events ultimately contributes to the deterioration of Parks property. In order to provide Parks the incentive to increase concessions revenue and to effectively prevent special events from causing long -term damage to Parks property, such concession fees and special events payments could be specifically earmarked to pay for the enhanced maintenance and upkeep of Parks property, such as re-sodding grass and replacing plantings, etc. In addition, the money collected from summonses and litigation  relating to damage to City trees could be expressly given to Parks for forestry related expenses, such as replanting trees and maintenance of City trees. Such an  amendment would provide greater incentives for Parks to generate revenue and would enable Parks to more immediately see the financial impact of enforcement efforts (i.e. tree damage cases). If this exception to 109 is viewed as too broad,  - 33 -   then Parks proposes that a certain percentage of the above revenue be retained by Parks. Moreover, Parks could dedicate all or a portion of these dedicated funds to specific Mayoral priorities, including developing waterfront parks or extending the service hours at playgrounds.  Registration of Concession Agreements  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to exempt Parks concession agreements from the City contract registration process? Relevant Charter Provision:  375. Discussion: Parks's revenue and administrative functions would be made more efficient if all concession agreements, or at least concessions which earn less than $100,000 in revenue for the City, were exempt from the registration process. Registering concession agreements, where the City receives money, does not present the same oversight concerns as those present in contracts where the City expends money. Moreover, the administrative expense and aggravation involved in registering every pushcart or other small concession far exceeds any benefit from the Comptroller's oversight of this large volume of concessions through the registration process. For example, Parks managed approximately 188 small concession  agreements, 90 temporary use concession agreements, and 170 special event vending permits in 2001. For many of these contracts, the City gets as little as $50 $1,000 in fees. The Comptroller's Office requires such concession agreements to be submitted 30 days before the implementation of the agreement. However, the  registration process is extremely time-consuming because it requires the input of a  - 34 -   large amount of data. Required strict compliance with the registration process will likely delay the City's receipt of this revenue source. This proposed amendment would lower administrative and bureaucratic costs with only a slight concomitant decrease in financial oversight. Further, Parks is already charged with regularly reporting the revenue earned by such concession agreements to the Comptroller's Office, and therefore the Comptroller's Office would retain its ability to monitor these contracts. In addition, the Comptroller's Office would also still be able to conduct audits of such contracts. In the alternative, Parks proposes that such concession agreements be subject to self-registration, whereby Parks inputs the relevant information to register a contract into the Comptroller's Office database, and the contract is deemed to be automatically registered. Although inputting such data would usually take about an hour, self-registration still would stream-line the current 30 day registration process and eliminate unproductive delays.  Use of Board of Education Property When Property is not in Use  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to give Parks jurisdiction to maintain and program activities on playgrounds and playing fields that are currently under the control of the Board of Education at those times when school programs are not taking place (i.e., weekends and school vacation periods)? Relevant Charter Provisions:  521, 533. Discussion: The demand for Parks to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields is extremely high, particularly during the summer. However, many of the playgrounds and playfields of the Board of Education are not in use in the summer,  - 35 -   and Parks' use of this property would expand its ability to provide youth athletic programs and playing fields for permitted activities throughout the City.  Authority to Value and Sell Parks Memorabilia and/or Artifacts  Issue: Should the Charter be amended to authorize the Department of Citywide Administrative Services' (""DCAS"") to issue waivers regarding the salvage process to other City agencies? Relevant Charter Provision:  811. Discussion: Currently, DCAS is responsible for receiving unwanted equipment from other agencies and for determining whether the equipment should be auctioned, reassigned, or destroyed. However, Parks has the expertise necessary to assign the appropriate value for a variety of memorabilia or artifacts that are not otherwise easy to value under the DCAS salvage process, such as old stadium seats, signs, and statutes, etc. Such objects have value for collectors and often can generate a much higher revenue than what the City receives through the DCAS salvage process. Therefore, in order to ease the significant burden the salvage responsibility imposes on DCAS and to generate more revenue for the City by capitalizing on Parks' expertise of specialty items, DCAS should be provided with the authority to issue waivers of its responsibility to salvage equipment to other City agencies.4 In this way, other agencies, such as Parks, with specialized expertise in specific items, would be able to value and sell the objects at a more competitive rate. Under these proposals, all revenue generated by the sale of such specialty items would be placed in the City's General Fund. 4  With this revision, Parks is not suggesting that it be given the authority to sell non -unique items. For example, Parks would not seek authority to sell old office furniture, computer equipment, vehicles, etc.  - 36 -    Issue:  Adding the Parks Commissioner to the Environmental Control Board Should the Charter be amended to add the Parks Commissioner to the  Environmental Control Board (""ECB"")? Relevant Charter Provisions:  1404. Discussion: The ECB has the authority to issue rules and regulations regarding many environmental topics, including air and water pollution, hazardous materials, defacement of City property. It also serve s as an administrative tribunal for various environmental violations. Parks plays an important role in enforcing and helping to promulgate rules and regulations answerable through ECB summons 5, and therefore Parks contends that it is logical for the Parks Commissioner to be included with the Commissioners of Environmental Protection, Sanitation, Buildings, Health, Police, Fire, and Consumer Affairs on the Board. Further, it would be useful to have the Parks Commissioner on the board since the ECB has the authority to adopt and amend regulations relating to the use and regulation of all property subject to Parks' jurisdiction.  PROCUREMENT Issue: Should the Charter be amended in relation to procurement?  Relevant Charter Provision: Chapter 13. Discussion: Both the 1999 and 2001 Charter Revision Commissions examined the City's procurement system, because of concerns expressed both by City  5  For ex ample, Parks employs Parks Enforcement Police officers to issue ECB summons for the violation of Parks rules and requires these officers to be present at the hearings of these violations.  - 37 -   agencies and members of the public, including the contracting community, that the system was inefficient. The primary criticism of the procurement process was that it caused the City to take too long to enter into contracts. The proposals made by the 1999 Commissionincluding proposals to raise the small purchase limit and to make it easier to procure goods, services or construction from another governmental entity were defeated as part of the single question that was submitted to the voters. The 2001 staff recommendations included increasing the small purchase limits, allowing DCAS to delegate to user agencies the authority to purchase certain goods, raising the dollar threshold for holding public hearings on contracts, streamlining the registration process, and providing for centralized vendor integrity assessment. The Commission ultimately chose to propose to the voters only the centralized vendor integrity assessment provision. That  proposal was adopted at referendum, resulting in the repeal of the then-existing Charter  335, and its replacement with the current Section 335. Procurement continues to be an important topic in 2002. In February, the Citizens Budget Commission issued a report on the City's procurement process, suggesting that the City could realize significant budget savings if it streamlined the process, introduced strategic procurement methods, and applied technology to the process. In both the Preliminary and Executive Budgets, the Mayor  included significant savings in the out - years of the Financial Plan from a Procurement Reform Initiative. As the representatives of the Mayor's Office  commenced work on the Procurement Reform Initiative in the Spring of 2002, the  - 38 -   City Council adopted many reforms, summarized below, that had been proposed during the past several years. First, the Council raised small purchases limits. Prior to amendment of the limits, small purchases had been defined as procurements in value of not more than $25,000 for goods and services, not more than $50,000 for construction and construction-related services, and not more than $100,000 for information technology. Effective July 8, 2002, the limits were raised, by concurrent action of the Procurement Policy Board (""PPB"") and the Council, see Charter  314, to purchases in value of not more than $25,000 for goods, $50,000 for services, and $100,000 for construction, construction-related services, and information technology. A second example of procurement reform enacted by the Council in 2002 was in the area of public hearings on contracts. Section 326 of the Charter basically requires public hearings for all non-bid contracts value d over $100,000. By Local Law No. 8 (2002), however, the Mayor and the Council amended Charter  326 to somewhat address the perceived burden of this requirement. While Local Law No. 8 did not change the $100,000 threshold, it added a provision that allo wed an agency to not hold an otherwise necessary hearing in certain circumstances. Specifically, Charter  326(a) not provides that if, within a period of time to be set by the PPB, ""no individual requests an opportunity to speak at such a public hearing with respect to any such proposed contract the value of which does not exceed five hundred thousand dollars, then such public hearing need not be conducted.""  - 39 -   The Commission staff has been asked to identify other issues for the Commission, and to report on the progress made on them since the last Commission studied procurement in 2001. However, the Mayor is in the process of conducting, as coordinated by the Mayor's Office of Contracts, a major Procurement Reform Initiative. Representatives of the Mayor ha ve met, and  continue to meet, with important stockholder in the procurement community, including the City Council, the Comptroller, vendors and Agency Chief Contracting Officers. The Procurement Reform Initiative is an effort to  comprehensively examine the City's procurement system, in an effort to make large-scale reforms that will make the system more efficient, and thereby benefit both the City and its contractors. In light of the Initiative, it has been  recommended to the Commission staff that procure ment not be studied at this time as a source for possible reform, in view of the process that began before this Charter Revision Commission.  - 40 -   PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS THE BOROUGH PRESIDENTS Issue: Should the Charter be amended either to eliminate or alter the powers of the Offices of Borough President? Relevant Charter Provisions:  81 through 86.  Discussion: Commission staff received several public comments concerning the Offices of Borough President. One comment recommended the offices be  eliminated because they perform functions that are duplicative of functions performed by other City offices and officials. The recommendation notes that the elimination of Borough Presidents would save approximately $38 million dollars. Another comment recommends that the Commission reconsider the role of Borough Presidents, including whether they should have control over certain discretionary capital and expense budget allocations.  - 41 -"
GX256-15-6666369	AMENDED IN SENATE APRIL 21, 2003 AMENDED IN SENATE MARCH 26, 2003  SENATE BILL  No. 465  Introduced by Senator Soto  February 20, 2003  An act to amend Sections 65460.1, 65460.2, and 65460.4 of, and to add Section 65040.9 to, the Government Code, and to amend Section 33030 33031 of, and to add Chapter 4.7 (commencing with Section 33499) to Part 1 of Division 24 of, the Health and Safety Code, relating to transit village plans. LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST  SB 465, as amended, Soto. Transit village plan: design. (1) Under existing law, the Office of Planning and Research is the comprehensive state planning agency that is required to engage in the formulation, evaluation, and updating of the state's long-range goals and policies for land use, population growth and distribution, urban expansion, development, open space, resource preservation and utilization, air and water quality, and other factors that shape statewide development patterns and significantly influence the quality of the state's environment. This bill would require the office to convene a task force to create statewide guidelines that incorporate the best available practices for transit village planning and design. The bill would require that the guidelines be completed, adopted, and published by October 1, 2004, and serve as advisory guidelines to local government agencies, cities, and counties. (2) The 97   SB 465  --2--  The Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 authorizes a city or county to prepare a transit village plan for a transit village development district that includes all land within not less than 1/4 mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which is located a rail transit station and addresses specified characteristics, including a neighborhood centered around a transit station that is planned and designed, as specified, and demonstrable public benefits that reduce traffic congestion. The Community Redevelopment Law specifies both the physical and economic conditions that cause blight. This bill would extend the surrounding land of a transit village development district to 1/2 mile from a rail transit station. The bill would add as a characteristic of a transit village plan a provision that not less than 20% of new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units constructed or developed within the district be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, as defined, with not less than 40% of these units to be available at affordable housing cost to very low income households, as defined. The bill would also specify conditions that constitute cause blight with respect to land surrounding a rail transit station an urbanized area covered by a transit village plan. This bill would also enact an alternative method of adoption of a redevelopment plan that would authorize a city or county that has adopted a transit village plan area to adopt a new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, as specified, to include in a redevelopment project area all or a portion of an existing transit village plan area and to enable 2 or more adjoining local agencies to enter into an agreement to jointly establish and operate the new redevelopment plan for a Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area, as specified. Vote: majority. Appropriation: no. Fiscal committee: yes. State-mandated local program: no. The people of the State of California do enact as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SECTION 1. Section 65040.9 is added to the Government Code, to read: 65040.9. By April 1, 2004, the Office of Planning and Research shall convene a task force composed of representatives of cities, counties, transit agencies, private developers, architects, environmental organizations, and other individuals as nominated by their statewide organizations and associations, public agencies, 97   --3-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  SB 465  and private organizations with expertise in transit village planning and design, for the purpose of creating statewide guidelines that incorporate the best available practices for transit village planning and design. The issues addressed by the guidelines shall include a listing of recommended local financial and other tools to promote higher density development within transit villages, including a recommendation of the most appropriate use of density bonuses for residential and commercial development, and the use of parking reductions. The office shall adopt and publish the guidelines by October 1, 2004. The guidelines shall be advisory to each city and county in the planning, design, and implementation of transit villages. SEC. 2. SECTION 1. Section 65460.1 of the Government Code is amended to read: 65460.1. The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following: (a) Federal, state, and local governments in California are investing in new and expanded rail transit systems in areas throughout the state, including Los Angeles County, the San Francisco Bay area, San Diego County, Santa Clara County, and Sacramento County. (b) This public investment in rail transit is unrivaled in the state's history and represents well over ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000) fourteen billion dollars ($14,000,000,000) in planned investment alone. (c) An October 1998 report from the Institute of Urban and Regional Development at the University of California, Berkeley, recommended that the Legislature amend this act to expand the spatial dimensions of a transit village from a quarter-mile to a half-mile radius from rail transit stations. (d) The use of transit by persons living near rail transit stations is particularly important given the decline of transit ridership in California between 1980 and 1990. Transit's share of commute trips dropped in all California metropolitan areas--greater Los Angeles: 5.4 percent to 4.8 percent; San Francisco Bay area: 11.9 percent to 10.0 percent; San Diego: 3.7 percent to 3.6 percent; Sacramento: 3.7 percent to 2.5 percent. (e) Only a few rail transit stations in California have any concentration of housing proximate to the station. is increasingly 97   SB 465 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  --4--  important as demonstrated in the January 2002, Statewide Transit-Oriented Development Study performed for the California Department of Transportation's Division of Mass Transportation. (e) The success of a dozen transit-oriented developments in California signals the emergence of and the need to support this important and practical alternative to patterns of lower-density development that depend on automobiles and highways. (f) Interest in clustering housing and commercial development around rail transit stations, called transit villages, has gained momentum in recent years. SEC. 3. SEC. 2. Section 65460.2 of the Government Code is amended to read: 65460.2. A city or county may prepare a transit village plan for a transit village development district that addresses the following characteristics: (a) A neighborhood centered around a transit station that is planned and designed so that residents, workers, shoppers, and others find it convenient and attractive to patronize transit. (b) A mix of housing types, including apartments, within not more than a half mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which the transit station is located. (c) Other land uses, including a retail district oriented to the transit station and civic uses, including day care centers and libraries. (d) Pedestrian and bicycle access to the transit station, with attractively designed and landscaped pathways. (e) A rail transit system that should encourage and facilitate intermodal service, and access by modes other than single occupant vehicles. (f) Demonstrable public benefits beyond the increase in transit usage, including all of the following: (1) Relief of traffic congestion. (2) Improved air quality. (3) Increased transit revenue yields. (4) Increased stock of affordable housing. (5) Redevelopment of depressed and marginal inner-city neighborhoods. (6) Live-travel options for transit-needy groups.  97   --5-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  SB 465  (7) Promotion of infill development and preservation of natural resources. (8) Promotion of a safe, attractive, pedestrian-friendly environment around transit stations. (9) Reduction of the need for additional travel by providing for the sale of goods and services at transit stations. (10) Promotion of job opportunities. (11) Improved cost-effectiveness through the use of the existing infrastructure. (12) Increased sales and property tax revenue. (13) Reduction in energy consumption. (g) Sites where a density bonus of at least 25 percent may be granted pursuant to specified performance standards. (h) (1) Not less than 20 percent of the new and substantially rehabilitated dwelling units constructed or developed within the district shall be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income, with not less than 40 percent of those dwelling units required to be available at affordable housing cost to persons and families of low or moderate income to be available at affordable housing cost to very low income households. (2) As used in this subdivision, the term ``substantially rehabilitated dwelling units'' shall mean substantially rehabilitated single-family dwelling units with one or two units, or substantially rehabilitated multifamily rented dwelling units with three or more units. (3) As used in this subdivision, the term ``substantial rehabilitation'' means rehabilitation, the value of which constitutes not less than 25 percent of the after rehabilitation value of the dwelling, inclusive of land value.

A transit village development district shall include all land within not more than a half mile of the exterior boundary of the parcel on which is located a rail transit station designated by the legislative body of a city, county, or city and county that has jurisdiction over the station area. For purposes of this article, ``district'' means a transit village development district as defined in this section. SEC. 5. Section 33030 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 33030. (a) It is found and declared that there exist in many communities blighted areas which constitute physical and economic liabilities, requiring redevelopment in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of these communities and of the state. (b) A blighted area is one that contains both of the following: (1) An area that is predominantly urbanized, as that term is defined in Section 33320.1, and is an area in which the combination of conditions set forth in Section 33031 is so prevalent and so substantial that it causes a reduction of, or lack of, proper utilization of the area to such an extent that it constitutes a serious physical and economic burden on the community which cannot reasonably be expected to be reversed or alleviated by private enterprise or governmental action, or both, without redevelopment. (2) An area that is characterized by either of the following: (A) One or more conditions set forth in any paragraph of subdivision (a) of Section 33031 and one or more conditions set forth in any paragraph of subdivision (b) of Section 33031.

(4) The higher density of development that is permitted by the transit village plan would not reasonably be expected to be achieved by private enterprise or government action, or both, without redevelopment. SEC. 4. Section 33031 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read: 33031. (a) This subdivision describes physical conditions that cause blight: (1) Buildings in which it is unsafe or unhealthy for persons to live or work. These conditions can be caused by serious building code violations, dilapidation and deterioration, defective design or physical construction, faulty or inadequate utilities, or other similar factors. (2) Factors that prevent or substantially hinder the economically viable use or capacity of buildings or lots. This condition can be caused by a substandard design, inadequate size given present standards and market conditions, lack of parking, or other similar factors.

T RANSIT  VILLAGE R AREAS  EDEVELOPMENT  PROJE  CT  33499. With enactment of this chapter, it is the intent of the Legislature to do both of the following: (a) Provide cities and counties with a means to facilitate redevelopment of territory within a transit village plan area established by the legislative body of the community pursuant to the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code).  97   --9-- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  SB 465  (b) Enable redevelopment agencies to include in a redevelopment project area all or a portion of a transit village plan area and thereby utilize the powers of this part with respect to those transit village plan areas. 33499.1. The Legislature finds and declares that extraordinary measures must be taken to facilitate the redevelopment of transit village plan areas and thereby promote the purposes set forth in the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code). 33499.2. Nothing in this chapter shall preclude two or more adjoining cities or counties or their redevelopment agencies, as applicable, from entering into agreements to jointly establish and operate a redevelopment plan for a transit village redevelopment project area if the transit village plan areas are contiguous and each city or county has adopted a transit village plan pursuant to the Transit Village Development Planning Act of 1994 (Article 8.5 (commencing with Section 65460) of Chapter 3 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code). 33499.3.

(b) The territory included in the new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall not, at the time of adoption of such that plan, be located within an existing redevelopment project area. The new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall include as the redevelopment project area only territory encompassed by such that transit village plan and may include all or a portion of such that transit village plan area. The designated area shall be known 97   SB 465 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40  -- 10 --  as a Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area. A new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan shall not be adopted unless the proposed Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area is found by the legislative body of the city or county to be a blighted area pursuant to the criteria set forth in subdivision (d) of Section 33030. 33499.5. A new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to Section 33499.4, which contains the provisions set forth in Section 33670 shall contain all of the following limitations: (a) A time limit, not to exceed 40 years from the adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, on the effectiveness of the redevelopment plan. After the time limit on the effectiveness of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, the local agency shall have no authority to act pursuant to the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan except to pay previously incurred indebtedness and to enforce existing covenants or contracts, unless the local agency has not completed its housing obligations pursuant to Section 33413, in which case the local agency shall retain its authority to implement requirements under Section 33413, including its ability to incur and pay indebtedness for this purpose, and shall use this authority to complete these housing obligations as soon as is reasonably possible. (b) A time limit, not to exceed 60 years from the adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, to repay indebtedness with the proceeds of property taxes received pursuant to Section 33670. After the time limit established pursuant to this paragraph, a local agency may not receive property taxes pursuant to Section 33670. (c) A time limit, not to exceed 12 years from the date of adoption of the Transit Village Redevelopment Plan, for commencement of eminent domain proceedings to acquire property within the Transit Village Redevelopment Project Area. This time limitation may be extended only by amendment of the redevelopment plan. 33499.6. In adopting a new Transit Village Redevelopment Plan pursuant to Section 33499.4, the local agency shall prepare the appropriate environmental document pursuant to the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000 of the Public Resources Code). 97   -- 11 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6  SB 465  33499.7.

Kuehnel, Personally and Representing Save the Dam Foundation 1032 Beech Street Cleveland, WI 53015 FINDINGS OF FACT On May 28, 1993, the Village of Cleveland, c/o Gary C. Schmitz, Village 1. President, applied to the Department of Natural Resourcesfor a permit to remove the   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 2 Centerville dam (the dam) on Centerville Creek within the Village of Cleveland. The dam is located in the SE l/4 of the NE 114 of Section 27, Township 17 North, Range 23 Fast, Village of Cleveland, Manitowoc County, W isconsin. 2. The Department of Natural Resources issued a Notice which stated,that unless written objection was made within thirty days after publication, the Department might issue a decision on the permit without a hearing. Timely objections were filed to the Department opposing the permit application. Publication of the Notice of Proposed Permit was made in the ShebovPanPress on July 15, 1993. (Ex 21) Notice of the first proposed date of public hearing was published on September 9, 1994, in the Herald Ties Reuorter. (Ex 22) An Amended Notice of Public Hearing giving the public notice of the amended January 5, 1995 hearing date was published on October 24, 1994, also in the Manitowoc Herald Times Reoorter. Given these facts, the applicant and the Department have complied with all relevant procedural requirements of sec. 31.185, Stats., including compliance with sec. 31.06.

Exhibit 15 indicates a conveyance of the ""so-called mill property "", including a ""mill dam "" on December 5, 1895. Solely on the basis of this document, Mr. Kuehnel argues that the dam is a mill dam and therefore exempt from the provisions of sec. 31.187, Stats. On this record, the AU fmds an insufficient basis to reach such a conclusion, and finds that the provisions of Ch. 31 govern this application. There is evidence that the current concrete structure at the site was constructed in 1935. (Ex. 10) Further, on its face sec. 31.185, Stats. does not exempt mill dams, but grants the Department authority to require a permit to abandon ""any dam "". 4. An inspection of the dam was performed by Department Dam Safety staff on January 29, 1988. The inspection concluded that there were numerous deficiencies effecting dam safety, including concrete deterioration of the construction joints and walkway, embankment erosion and no dam warning sign. On October 5, 1992, the Department issued an order for Impoundment Draw 5. down, Dam Reconstruction or Abandonment (the 1992 Order). Repairs to the dam were undertaken in September of 1992. These repairs revealed that deficiencies on the dam were even more extensive than had been described in the 1988 inspection. Extensive concrete   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 3 deterioration was evident, as were voids under the apron and a lack of concrete reinforcement. The October 5, 1992 Order concluded that: ""The dam in its present condition, is not ,. sufficiently strong, is unsafe and dangerous to life, health and property. "" The 1992 Order required a draw down of the impoundment, which was 6. accomplished in October of 1992. The Village was required to engage the services of a professional engineer to complete needed dam repairs or to submit a request to abandon the dam pursuant to sec. 31.185, Stats., by June 1, 1993. On May 28, 1992, the Village tiled the Application For A Permit To Abandon A Dam that is the subject of this action. of The Department has made an environmental assessment the proposed 7. abandonmentand determined that the grant or denial of the proposed permit would not constitute a major state action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The proposed abandonmentwill not adversely affect water quality nor increase 8. water pollution in CenterviJle Creek nor cause environmental pollution as defined in subset. 144.30(g), Stats., upon compliance with the conditions of the Order. The proposed abandonmentwill not adversely affect public rights in navigable 9. waters and will not endanger life, health and property upon compliance with the conditions in the Order. Numerous persons oppose the abandonmentof the dam, but no municipalities, persons or organization have indicated a wilhngness to acquire ownership of the dam and complete all necessaryrepairs. 10.

The Department has made an investigation of the dam. On the basis of such the following actions are deemed necessaryas part of the process of of the dam to preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and health and property: Village of Cleveland shah submit fml dam removal and restoration plans to the Department for approval. The plans shall include all temporary or construction roads, cofferdams, erosion control measures, or other temporary or permanent structures required for the removal project. Prior to removal, a portion of the concrete dam must be breached at least to elevation 81.0 (based on the datum in the original plans). AlJ newly exposed  b.   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 4 sediment should be promptly graded as necessaryand seeded (assuming seasonalconditions will allow germination). C.  All concrete, earth, wood and steel portions of the dam shall be removed completely to native soil or bedrock, including spillway, walks, fences, abutments, gates, penstock pipe section and earth berms. Existing retaining walls on shorelines in the former impoundment may remain if they will be structurally stable under the new conditions. Steel from gates, walks and spillways shall be salvaged for recycling and removed from the site. Concrete and soil shall be placed in an approved disposal area. No broken concrete shall be used as riprap. The exposed pond sediment at the upstream face of the dam shall be graded back at a minimmu slope of 6:l. Silt fence shall be placed at the toe of the sediment until stabilized by vegetation. All exposed banks at the dam removal site shall be stabilized with riprap over filter fabric. Erosion control measuresand sedimentation protection techniques shall be employed throughout the project area to ensure that any dismrbed areas are stabilized and protected from erosion. The project must at all times meet the minimmn protection standardsdescribed in the ""W isconsin Construction Site Best Management Practice Handbook "", DNR publication WR-222-89. The erosion control plan must be approved by the Lake Michigan District Office prior to the start of construction. The Village of Cleveland may be required to obtain a section 404 permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Paul District. DISCUSSION  d. e. f. g.  h. 1.  i  Mr. Chris Kuehnel appeared at hearing objecting to the Village request to abandon the dam. In addition to the procedural and legal arguments noted above, Kuelmel described his efforts to put together a group to acquire ownership of the dam. Prior to issuing this decision, the ALl allowed Kuehnel the 120 day period required by sec. 31.185(4), Stats, to provide evidence that such a group had agreed to acquire ownership of the dam. No such evidence was submitted.   Case No. 3-LM-93-340 Page 5 Kuehnel conceded at hearing that he had no specializedknowledge on environmental issues, nor did he provide any other expert opinions disputing the DNR position that there would be no significant adverse environmental consequences a result of abandonment of as the dam.

A detached accessory dwelling unit (detached ADU) is a small, often rented, living space, that is on the same lot but physically separate from a single family house. Detached ADUs can create attractive and affordable rental opportunities in Seattle without changing the character or quality of life in existing single family areas. Detached ADUs can provide greater flexibility for the homeowner - who is already allowed to rent out a portion of his or her home. They also offer a new housing type to Seattle that is desirable, quiet and affordable, and compatible with single family homes.  2  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Introduction The following proposal to amend the Land Use Code includes analysis and recommendations for proposed use and development standards that would allow detached accessory dwelling units (detached ADUs) in Single Family Zones. The report describes detached ADUs and how they would fit into Seattle neighborhoods, and contains proposed development standards that would govern their establishment.  Background In 1998, a Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design was established by the City Council to help further diversify Seattle's housing supply and provide an alternative to conventional detached houses, condominiums, or apartments. The Demonstration Program tested innovative residential design concepts, including detached ADUs, using alternative development standards and processes. An evaluation of the projects completed under the Demonstration Program accompanies this report. It reviews four detached ADUs permitted under the Demonstration Program, and is part of an overall evaluation of the program mandated by the Council at the conclusion of the program. Survey forms were mailed to all residents within 300 feet of constructed Demonstration Program projects to assist in their evaluation. Neighbors were asked about the impacts of the new detached ADU project in their neighborhood. On the whole, the results of the surveys were very positive.  Public Process In preparing recommendations for code amendments to permit detached ADU's, significant measures have been taken to ensure community dialogue about detached ADUs:  ! In February, the Planning Commission held three focus groups, representing the general public, those familiar with the innovative housing concepts under consideration, and the design and development community, to discuss the broad community and development issues surrounding detached ADUs.  ! After the focus groups, the Planning Commission and the Department of Design, Construction, and Land Use (DCLU) co-hosted a public forum to present the results of the focus groups and preliminary concepts for permitting detached ADUs. The forum included lively panel and small group discussions relating to both detached ADUs and cottage housing, (another form of innovative housing evaluated as part of the Demonstration Program that is being examined by DCLU).  ! The information presented at the forum was posted online on the City's website, and included an online survey form identical to one that accompanied a brochure distributed at the forum. The brochure was also mailed to Seattle's neighborhood and community councils and planning groups.  ! Staff also met with the Seattle chapter of the American Institute of Architects to discuss proposed development concepts and standards.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  3   ! Finally, staff has presented the proposal and gotten feedback from a variety of community members, including design professionals, community councils, and other organizations.  Meeting City Planning Goals This proposal advances several Seattle Comprehensive Plan Goals and Policies for several plan elements, including Land Use, Housing, and Neighborhoods. Neighborhood Plan Goals can be found in the appendices of this report.  Comprehensive Plan Land Use Goals include: LG8 Accommodate the City's existing and future housing needs through maintenance of existing residential neighborhoods and the creation of new residential neighborhoods. LG9 More efficiently use limited land resources. LG14 Increase opportunities for detached single family dwellings attractive to many residents, including families with children. LG15 Encourage development of ground-related housing types including townhouses, duplexes, triplexes, ground-related apartments, small cottages, accessory units and single family homes.  Comprehensive Plan Housing Goals include: G4 Achieve a mix of housing types attractive and affordable to a diversity of ages, incomes, household types, household sizes, live/work situations and cultural backgrounds. G7 Accommodate a variety of housing types that are attractive and affordable to potential buyers. The proposal also supports 1999-2004 Housing Consolidated Plan strategies by assisting homeowners with accessory dwelling units, by helping to produce affordable rental housing, and by helping to encourage private affordable rental housing.  4  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   ADUs and Current Zoning Between 1900 and up to the 1950s, ADUs were commonly allowed under provisions related to domestic servants quarters. However, in ensuing years, concerns about neighborhood density, parking availability, and the protection of the single family character of Seattle neighborhoods, provisions for ADUs of any sort were prohibited. In 1993, in response to widespread concern about the escalating cost of housing, the Washington State legislature required that communities develop legislation incorporating the appropriate safeguards to allow ADUs throughout the city. When Seattle adopted provisions for ADUs, there were concerns about a very large number being added in single family zones, as well as a concern that the single family zones were being ""duplexed."" Most approximations turned out to be grossly overestimated (up to tenfold) once permit applications started coming in. At the time, there was some support for allowing detached ADUs, but provisions for them were not pursued, in part due to concerns about their effect on single family character. Since ADUs were first allowed, the Land Use Code's ADU provisions have been amended, but not to allow detached ADUs.  An addition to a single family home in Ballard. The detached ADU proposal will encourage smaller, more compatible structures than what some have built under existing single family zoning requirements.  Other Jurisdictions A number of jurisdictions in the Puget Sound region allow both ADUs and detached ADUs in their single family zones. They include Clyde Hill, Issaquah, Kirkland, Mercer Island, Newcastle, Redmond, parts of unincorporated King County, Woodinville, and Yarrow Point.  Current Rules In Seattle, the rules governing accessory dwelling units allow ADUs outright in all single family zones. New ADUs must be added to or part of an existing structure and the property owner must reside in either the primary residence, or in the ADU. One off-street parking space must be available for the ADU, and all ADUs are limited to a maximum of 1,000 square feet in size (although there are some exceptions to both of these standards).  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  5   There are 1,200 ADUs in the city with final permits. 1,513 people have applied for ADUs since they were once again permitted in 1993. Approximately 20% of those applications are still active, have been abandoned, or never received the final permit and certificate of occupancy for various reasons. Figure 1, Issued and Finaled ADU Permit 400 Applications, shows the trend of ADU permits 350 since DCLU began allowing them in August 300 of 1994. (Data is incomplete for 1994, the first 250 year that ADUs were allowed.) Applications for 200 ADUs increased in the 150 late 1990's, as did development activity in all 100 sectors, consistent with the economic prosperity 50 experienced throughout the region. Additionally, 0 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 the large number of # ADU Permits Issued # ADU Permits Finaled permits DCLU issued between 1996 and 1998 can be attributed to the Figure 1: Issued and Finaled ADU Permit Applications legalization of existing ADUs that were present throughout the city. Since 1998, the number of ADU applications has remained fairly consistent. ADU Permit Applications  Complaints about significant drop in of the opportunity larly dropped over legalize ADUs.  illegal dwelling units have also remained steady over the last four years after a complaints experienced after 1995, perhaps due to more widespread knowledge to legally establish ADUs. The number of violations issued by DCLU has simitime. Approximately a quarter of the violations result in permits issued to  6  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Analysis Detached ADUs are a housing option that offers many of the benefits of single family homesincluding a detached unit with no shared walls, a yard, and generally, a location in a single family neighborhood often perceived to be quieter and more private than denser multifamily or commercial neighborhoods -but may be more affordable due to their smaller size. As with any change to the Land Use Code, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential impacts of increasing housing density in Seattle's neighborhoods. The potential benefits of detached ADUs include:  ! more flexibility for a homeowner by allowing them to live in their main home or in the detached ADU;  ! a financial benefit to the homeowner that further enhances their investment; ! a new housing type that is in-demand and a housing option not previously widely available; ! attractive and affordable housing for singles or young couples, or for older citizens who may find the upkeep and costs of maintaining a single family home increasingly daunting; both growing segments of the population in Seattle and nationwide;  ! can be designed more sensitively to surroundings than an addition to, or redevelopment of, an existing home;  ! allows more people the opportunity to enjoy some of the advantages of a single family home without having to own a home.  Balancing the Positives and Negatives of Detached ADUs In order to assess the pros and address the cons of allowing detached ADUs, DCLU has endeavored to estimate the number of detached ADUs that are anticipated to be constructed and the pace at which their construction is expected to proceed. Construction of detached ADUs, like ADUs generally, is dependent upon factors such as Seattle's overall economic well being, and the general strength of the local housing market. Several factors make it likely that fewer permit applications for detached ADUs can be expected than was experienced for ADUs:  ! Not every home owner will want to be a landlord or share their property with someone else; ! The complexity of development of a detached ADU; ! The increased costs of construction; and ! Not all sites will be eligible (whereas ADUs could theoretically occur within any single family home). Not everyone that may be eligible to build a detached ADU will choose to do so, just as not every single family home owner who could, has established an ADU in their home (a little over 1% have so far). Many people will not wish to take on the additional burden of being a landlord, much less a developer and the costs associated with both. To convert or build a new detached ADU, most homeowners will need to hire a builder and/or architect. The owner, architect, or builder will need to apply for both a Master Use Permit and DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003 7   a building permit. Because detached ADUs are free standing structures, and subject to both the Seattle Land Use and Building Codes, it will likely be beyond the expertise of the average homeowner to construct one themselves. In contrast, many single family homes can more easily incorporate an ADU into a finished basement or upstairs level, and if little or no construction work is being done, only two steps need to be taken: a permit for the ADU, and an inspection by DCLU to confirm that the living space meets basic standards. The costs to construct Demonstration Program detached ADUs (generally between $100,000$200,000) indicate that it is probable that most will be long-term investments. The higher costs for detached ADUs make them less likely to be developed by most homeowners than their attached counterparts. Still, the fact that they are detached may appeal to some homeowners that would like the flexibility and benefits that come with ADUs, but do not wish to share walls with others. Further, DCLU may see a number of applications for detached ADUs in the first two to three years of allowing them due to pent up demand, but the numbers will not likely exceed that which was experienced with attached ADUs, for which anticipated numbers were considerably overestimated by proponents and opponents alike. Development of detached ADUs will very likely slow and level off in following years as experience with attached ADUs demonstrated. Using permit data for attached ADUs from the years 1999-2002 as a basis for estimating detached ADU activity, up to approximately 370 units could be built in Seattle over the next four years. Deducting 17%, the estimated number of parcels that will be ineligible or for other reasons may be difficult to build a detached ADU (see Overall Effect of Development Standards, later in this document), an estimate of 307 potential units was derived. Deducting another 25% for the factors contributing to a decision by a homeowner to not build a detached ADU results in an estimate of 230 detached ADUs over four years. Based on these results, we may expect an average of around 54 new detached ADUs permitted per year over time. Depending on a variety of factors, such as the economy and in particular, the housing market, more units could be permitted in a year - but it would still be a very small amount compared to the total number of single family homes citywide. By comparison, DCLU issues around 300 permits for new single family homes each year.  Addressing Concerns The four biggest concerns cited by neighbors of Demonstration Program projects are listed below; these are the issues that are perceived to most affect existing neighborhoods. The proposed development standards for detached ADUs have been written to directly address these potential impacts. Additionally, the nature of detached ADUs may actually have a positive effect on a neighborhood.  Traffic At the neighborhood level, detached ADUs are not anticipated to result in more cars on the street than what is currently allowed by the Land Use Code, since accessory dwelling units are already allowed in single family dwellings. Detached ADUs can actually help prevent more 8 Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   regional traffic congestion in the Puget Sound area by putting more housing choices in Seattle, nearer to jobs, transit, and goods and services.  Parking The existing requirement of one off-street parking space per dwelling unit for any new ADU will be continued whether detached or incorporated into the existing dwelling unit. Exceptions for smaller lots and steep slopes will continue to apply in neighborhoods with on-street parking availability, and no changes to current provisions are proposed.  Privacy Perceptual impacts can be more difficult to address than physical ones, such as the decrease in privacy. However, development standards have been crafted to minimize privacy impacts - and the perception of privacy impacts - by taking lot size, lot width, and the presence of alleys into account. No increase in impacts on privacy are anticipated beyond what may already occur as new single family houses are built or existing homes are remodeled and expanded.  Quality of Design Again, proposed development standards have been crafted to help ensure a proper ""fit"" of the detached ADU with the existing house and neighborhood, a significant aspect of allowing detached ADUs. Experience gained from the Demonstration Program reinforces the notion that one size does not fit all, and that proper ""fit"" can make detached ADUs successful. A combination of standards written to carefully control height, bulk, and scale relative to lot sizes, and a guide that helps applicants through the process while also encouraging architectural design that fits in with existing structures can help protect people's most important investments: their homes.  Proposed Permit Approach Detached ADUs would be non-appealable Master Use Permit decisions (known as Type I in the Land Use Code). The level of review and regulations are reflective of the size and relative impact of the type of housing proposed. No greater number of units is being proposed for single family zones than what is already allowed. Further, standards for lot coverage and rear lot coverage are maintained, and in most circumstances, no further open space could be lost relative to what is currently required. To maintain consistency with existing provisions for a single family home, or a single family home with an attached accessory dwelling unit, no additional level of review or review discretion is recommended for detached ADUs.1 1. Because of their size and cost, administrative Design Review (which includes appealable decisions) would not be required for detached ADUs. All of the detached ADU applicants to the Demonstration Program specifically stated that the administrative Design Review process was too onerous or expensive for a project of this size. While the administrative Design Review Process helped shape several of the detached ADUs into better finished projects, addressing the bulk and scale of the projects was typically the most important aspect of these reviews. Bulk and scale will be appropriately shaped through proposed development standards, including floor-to-lot area requirements. The final aesthetics of the project will be left to the owner, who will still have to comply with the Seattle Building Codes, which ensures a reasonable level of livable space with appropriate insulation and siding, windows, access and other features.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  9   Proposed Development Standards Proposed site and development standards for detached ADUs are as follows. Objectives/Intent Basic site requirements help ensure space is available to fit a DADU and to maintain adequate open space Development Standards Minimum Lot Size Minimum Lot Width Minimum Lot Depth Maximum Total Lot Coverage (Including Main Structure) Lot Width (feet) Maximum Base Height (feet) Maximum Roof Pitch Height (feet) Maximum Shed or Butterfly Roof Pitch Height (feet) Gross floor area limits help ensure that the size of DADUs are appropriate for the lot Maximum Detached ADU Gross Floor-to-Lot-Area Ratio 3,000 ft2 25 ft 70 ft 35%  Maximum heights proportionate to lot width to minimize overshadowing of existing homes and privacy of adjacent homes  Less than 30 12 15 15  30-35 14 21 18  36-40 15 22 19  Greater than 40 16 23 20  ADU floor area is limited to 20% of the lot size, not to exceed 1,000 square feet including garage and storage area  Setbacks ensure space is maintained between DADUs and surrounding lots  Minimum Side Yard Setback Minimum Rear Yard Setback  Parking requirements will help maintain on-street parking availability The conversion of existing structures can result in minimal impacts and can help maintain neighborhood character.  Off Street Parking Space Conversion of Existing Structures  5 ft to property line; 10 feet on corner lots 5 feet; no setback when rear lot line is adjacent to alley, 12 feet from the alley centerline when a garage faces the alley. One per new unit required with some exceptions Existing structures built before June 1, 2003, may be converted to detached ADUs, so long as the extent of nonconformity is not increased.  Figure 2: Proposed development standards for detached ADUs.  10  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   It is important to note that the development standards are a combination of factors that can help to create successful projects. For instance, both allowed height and gross floor area are based on the size of a lot, yet both are intended together to control the bulk and scale of a new detached ADU. Additionally, the overlap of basic site and parking requirements will tend to direct detached ADUs to larger, wider lots and to lots on alleys.  Basic Site Requirements. Detached ADUs may be allowed in single family zones if basic site requirements are met. The proposed requirements would help ensure that enough space is available on a lot to fit a detached ADU and that open space is maintained. A detached ADU would be allowed if:  ! the lot is 3,000 square feet or larger; ! if the lot width is 25 feet or greater and the lot depth is 70 feet or greater; and ! the maximum allowed lot coverage (35%) is not exceeded. ! the detached ADU is not within the Shoreline District. Additionally, the existing 40% maximum rear yard lot coverage requirement will be maintained. This standard will tend to encourage detached ADUs more on wider lots and lots with alleys. The maximum allowed lot coverage for SF zones is 35%. According to the City's Geographic Information System, about three-quarters of Single Family-zoned lots have 300 square feet or more allowed lot coverage available for an additional structure (300 square feet is an approximate minimum size for a newly constructed livable space, although the building code allows smaller living spaces). These basic site requirements make approximately 15% of Single-Family zoned parcels ineligible for detached ADUs. Another 1,700 single family parcels fully within the Shoreline District buffer bring this total to 17%.  Height Proposed height limits are based on lot widths (with a cap) to ensure that detached ADUs do not unnecessarily cast shadows on existing homes and that privacy impacts are minimized. The Demonstration Program evaluation confirmed that a roof pitch height of up to 24 feet can work for new detached ADUs on large lots, as long as the bulk of the project is limited. A smaller, narrower, sloped lot was also successful with a 22-foot tall structure (13 feet tall on the uphill side) and a bulk proportional to the lot size. To ensure that detached ADUs are diminutive relative to the height allowed for single family structures, a maximum roof pitch height of 23 feet is proposed for lots more than 40 feet in width, compared with 35 feet for single family structures. This maximum height is intended to allow units above garages on wider lots. Lots less than 30 feet in width are allowed to have detached ADUs, but they must conform to existing height limits for accessory structures. A ratio based on the Golden Rectangle (see Appendix for more information) is used to make the maximum roof pitch heights of lots between 30 and 40 feet wide proportional to the width. DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003 11   Detached ADU Proposal Illustrations These diagrams illustrate how the proposed development standards for detached ADUs could work on a variety of lot sizes in Seattle.  60x100 Lot  50x100 Lot  40x100 Lot  Note: Most maximum requirements begin at a lot sizes between 4,000 and 5,000 ft  2  Figure 3: Illustration of effect of proposed development standards for multiple lot sizes.  12  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   35x100 Lot  30x100 Lot  25x120 Lot  Note: Alley likely required for lots 30 ft. or narrower to meet lot coverage provisions.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  13   The base height of vertical walls, or the height just below the roof pitch, varied among Demonstration Program detached ADUs. The project with the tallest roof pitch had a base height of 11 feet, and the detached ADU above a garage on a sloping site in Wallingford had a base height of 17 feet with a flatter roof pitch above. A tall enough base height will allow units above garages, particularly on narrower lots. To encourage units above garages while still ensuring that detached ADUs are of a height appropriate to the size of the lot, a maximum base height of 16 feet is proposed for lots over 40 feet in width. Similar to the maximum pitch height, a ratio is used for lots between 30 and 40 feet in width to determine the maximum base heights. These requirements are also based on the Golden Rectangle to make the maximum heights proportional to the lot width. The maximum pitch height of 23 feet and maximum base height of 16 feet would apply to approximately 55% of single family lots. About a third of single family lots would be regulated by the height-to-width ratios, and around 3% of single family parcels would only be allowed to build a detached ADU under existing height rules for accessory structures.  Bulk and Scale The bulk and scale of a detached ADU relative to its surroundings are ultimately the most important factors of whether or not a project will be successful. A gross floor area ratio with a maximum limit ensures that the size of detached ADUs are appropriate for the size of the lots they are built on. Demonstration Program detached ADUs varied in the amount of gross floor area from 728 to 1,872 square feet, including garage and storage space. Gross floor area to lot area ratios varied from 0.15 up to 0.26. In the case of the highest floor to lot area ratio, some of the area included in the calculations might be considered below grade (on a sloping site) and not counted according to the proposed standard. Any area of the structure where the ceiling is 6.5 feet or greater in height above finished grade, or the floor-to-ceiling measurement is 6.5 feet or greater, would be counted as floor area. Accessory Dwelling Units are currently allowed up to 1,000 square feet if inside or attached to a single family structure. In this proposal, this amount would be maintained as a maximum for new detached ADU floor area. Lots smaller than 5,000 square feet would be regulated by a detached ADU floor-to-lot-area ratio of 20%. This means on a 4,000 square foot lot, a detached ADU would be limited to 800 square feet of above-grade floor area, including garages and storage areas. Due to existing lot sizes, the ratio would apply to approximately one third of all single family-zoned lots, with the remainder limited to a 1,000 square foot maximum.  Setbacks Setbacks side and from the feet from ensure space is maintained between detached ADUs and surrounding lots. A five-foot rear setback would apply to detached ADUs. On corner lots, a side setback of 10 feet street would apply. On alleys, a detached ADU would be required to be set back 12 the centerline of the alley.  14  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Parking One off-street space is currently required of accessory dwelling units, with some exceptions for small lots and steep slopes, provided on-street parking is available. These standards would be maintained for detached ADUs, further encouraging detached ADUs on alleys, where they tend to be less intrusive.  Conversions of Existing Structures The conversion of existing accessory structures, such as detached garages, to accessory dwelling units, can result in minimal impacts while maintaining neighborhood character. The conversion of existing structures that do not comply with development standards for detached ADUs would be allowed for a limited time period (two years - until June 1, 2005), so long as the nonconformity is not increased. After this amnesty period, the conversion would be allowed for structures known to exist prior to June 1, 2003. Many single family lots have small garages in a back corner at the end of a driveway. These provisions would allow them to be converted, and even added on to, although the height of the structure within the required setbacks could not be higher than what is allowed for accessory structures (12 feet with a 3-foot roof pitch). Figure 4 on Page 16 illustrates the potential development allowed by existing zoning compared to the proposed standards for conversion of an existing accessory structure to a detached ADU.  Overall Effect of Development Standards Proposed standards for Detached ADUs place emphasis on encouraging new units on wider, larger lots on alleys, without specifically discouraging them from smaller lots or on lots without alley access. The proposed regulations would shape detached ADUs on smaller and narrower lots to help ensure that their height, bulk, and scale are appropriate and proportional to the size of the lot The diagrams in Figure 3 on pages 12-13 illustrate the scale of detached ADU development allowed under the proposal for a variety of lot sizes. There are 119,212 single family-zoned lots with a single family dwelling in Seattle, the majority of which are zoned Single Family 5000. Due to location, size, and lot coverage requirements, the proposal would render approximately 10% of these lots, which are scattered throughout the city, ineligible for detached ADUs. Another 6.6% of single family lots - those not on an alley, between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet in size - would likely have a more difficult time meeting the proposed detached ADU standards of parking, lot coverage, and rear yard lot coverage.

These materials can be made available online and at DCLU's information and permitting counters. Many examples can be used from the constructed Demonstration Program for Innovative Housing Design projects. Some of these ""How-to"" items could include:  ! The location of the Detached ADU should maximize on-site open space while also maximizing the privacy of adjacent homes.  ! The size and location of windows should take the privacy of adjacent homes into account. ! The pitch of the roof and of dormers should reflect that of the primary structure. ! Window treatments, sizes, and locations should reflect those of the primary structure. ! Building materials and finishes should also reflect the primary structure. ! Detached ADUs should be designed to appear subordinate to the primary structure. ! Siting and landscaping should be used to minimize the visual appearance of detached ADUs.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  17   18  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Recommendation The intent of the detached ADU proposal is to provide more housing options for Seattle residents. Several benefits may be expected from allowing detached ADUs outright in single family zones with appropriate conditions and limitations, including:  ! more flexibility for a homeowner by allowing them to live in their main home or in the detached ADU;  ! a financial benefit to the homeowner that further enhances their investment; ! a new housing type that is in-demand and a housing option not previously widely available; ! attractive and affordable housing for singles or young couples, or for older citizens who may find the upkeep and costs of maintaining a single family home increasingly daunting; all growing segments of the population in Seattle and nationwide;  ! allows more people the opportunity to enjoy some of the advantages of a single family home without having to own a home;  ! allows an alternative housing type without significantly changing neighborhood character . In summary, the proposed Land Use Code amendments would allow for detached ADUs on singlefamily zoned lots that meet basic lot size and location standards. Once land use provisions are adopted into the Land Use Code, DCLU will finalize a Client Assistance Memo (or ""How-to"" guide) that will provide assistance to applicants in shaping sensitive and well-designed detached ADUs.  Development Standards Proposed development standards (see Figure 2 on page 10) will accomplish the following:  ! Basic site requirements will help ensure lots are appropriately sized to accommodate a detached ADU and that minimum open space is maintained.  ! Maximum heights are based on lot width to help ensure that detached ADUs do not cause unnecessary shadowing of existing homes and that privacy impacts are minimized.  ! Gross floor area limits help ensure the size of detached ADUs are appropriate for the size of lots they are built upon.  ! Setbacks help ensure that space is maintained between detached ADUs and surrounding lots. ! Parking requirements will help to maintain on-street parking availability. ! Consistent with existing ADU provisions, owner occupancy requirements will help to ensure neighborhood investment and property upkeep.  ! Consistent with existing ADU provisions, the maximum number of people allowed to live on a single family lot with a detached ADU will be 8 unrelated persons.  ! Conversions of existing structures will minimize impacts and help to maintain neighborhood character, where desirable.  DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  19   Other Changes The Land Use Code currently includes provisions related to ADUs that duplicate of provisions in the Seattle Building Code. These provisions prescribe minimum allowable ceiling height of six-feet-eight inches and includes an exception that allows ceiling heights as low as six-feetfour inches for accessory dwelling units that have been in existence prior to October 17, 1979. Existing building code provisions allow a ceiling height of six-feet-eight inches, and allows ducts and similar features to be as low as six-feet-four inches. The proposal calls for removing this language from the Land Use Code and using the Seattle Building Code to regulate interior living spaces. The proposal also would remove language that would potentially levy a $5,000 fine on a new owner of a single family home with an ADU for not notifying DCLU of the change in ownership status. This requirement puts a burden on a homeowner to know the Land Use Code if they buy a home with an ADU. More importantly, the requirement is not needed to effectively enforce owner occupancy requirements for ADUs and can result in overly burdensome consequences for new homeowners. DCLU recommends removing this language, as owner occupancy requirements will remain. Finally, provisions in the Land Use Code that allow home occupations within a single family structure (including the primary residence and an accessory dwelling unit) are proposed to be slightly modified. The proposal applies a consistent approach and would allow home occupations in the detached ADU.  Conclusion DCLU, in making recommendations, has considered recommendations or comments from affected departments, other government agencies or citizens as well as environmental documentation. These materials are available upon request. DCLU recommends approval of the proposed Land Use Code amendments.  20  Detached Accessory Dwelling Units   Appendices Related Neighborhood Plan Goals and Policies Capitol Hill CH-P12 Strive to preserve and provide a variety of housing types, including some singlefamily and other small scale dwellings.

DCLU Director's Report July 22, 2003  21   Proportional Structure Heights and the Golden Rectangle Since the time of the early Greeks, a ratio of approximately 1.618:1 has been used in art and architecture for its visible appeal. This number has many names, including the Divine Proportion, Phi, and the Golden Section. The ratio is also known as the Golden Rectangle. The number 1.618 can also be derived from a Fibonacci sequence, which is a sequence of numbers that occurs frequently in nature. Milan Pacioli's 1509 Divina Proportione was illustrated by Leonardo Da Vinci, who used the mathematical concept written about by Pacioli in his works. Finally, Le Corbusier, the famous modern architect, created his own system of architectural design based on the Golden Section, and used it in several of his buildings. In short, this ratio has been used throughout history in the creation of art and architecture, and is even present in nature in branching plants, pine cones, and flower petals. As the diagrams for different-sized lots show, deriving maximum base and roof pitch heights from this ratio works to effectively maintain a natural proportion of detached ADU height to lot width, ensuring that the overall height of a new structure is not overwhelming to its surroundings.

GX013-21-8101638	STATEMENT OF P. DANIEL SMITH, SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BEFORE THE HOUSE RESOURCES COMMITTEE, SUBCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL PARKS, RECREATION AND PUBLIC LANDS, ON H.R. 1521, A BILL TO PROVIDE FOR ADDITIONAL LANDS TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE BOUNDARY OF THE JOHNSTOWN FLOOD NATIONAL MEMORIAL IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.         June 24, 2003                 Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Department of the Interior on H.R. 1521, a bill to provide for additional lands to be included within the boundary of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in the State of  Pennsylvania .           The bill would add seven parcels of land to the boundary of the park to provide permanent protection for resources that are integral to the historic events that the park was established to commemorate.  Six of the parcels, totaling 2.33 acres, are approximately three miles from the park in the  village  of  Saint Michael  where the former South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was located.  The seventh parcel, comprising approximately 12 acres, is adjacent to the current boundary.  Recently, a property owner of a 0.18-acre parcel has indicated that he does not wish to sell his property.  We ask the Committee to amend the map reference in the bill to reflect this change of only six parcels being added to the park.  Land acquisition costs for these six parcels are approximately $805,000.  All parcels are for sale by willing sellers.         The Department supports the President’s Initiative to address the deferred maintenance backlog and taking care of our current responsibilities.  In this instance, we are faced with a unique situation concerning this boundary adjustment.  The historic structures central to this acquisition have always been considered key components of the park, but were to be protected, maintained, and interpreted through a public-private partnership.  However, the partner can no longer perform this function, based on financial problems.  For this reason, the Department believes it is appropriate to move forward with this bill at this time.           Johnstown Flood National Memorial comprises nearly 165 acres in western  Pennsylvania .  The park’s mission is to tell the stories of the events leading up to the  Johnstown  flood, of the flood itself, and of its effects on  Johnstown  and the nation.  The addition of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club properties would significantly increase the park’s capability to interpret the important events surrounding the  Johnstown  flood and the individuals associated with it.           On  May 31, 1889 , a poorly maintained earthen dam breeched, sending 20 million tons of water down the Little Conemaugh Valley into  Johnstown  and other surrounding communities.   A 36-foot wall of water rolled over the town at 40 miles per hour, flattening houses, trees, locomotives, and everything else in its path.  By the disaster’s end, 2,209 people had perished in the flood, another 40 died in the weeks after from typhoid, and property damage was estimated at $17 million.  It was the worst inland flood in the nation’s history and the first test of the newly formed American Red Cross, headed up by Clara Barton.         A pivotal part of the story revolves around the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, located in Saint Michael, which in 1879 had purchased an abandoned reservoir, repaired the old dam, and created a private lake and recreational area for its members.   Because the dam was not properly constructed or maintained, it gave way after heavy rains pounded the area, overtaxing the  Lake   Conemaugh  dam spillway and eventually causing the dam to fail.           In 1986, the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places at the state level of significance.           In 1989, the Park Service and residents of Saint Michael undertook a joint planning effort, which produced the  Preservation and Interpretation Plan for the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District.   This plan outlined concepts and guidance for basic visitor services, interpretation, cultural resource preservation and maintenance.  As a result of the plan, there developed a structured partnership between the village  of Saint Michael and the Park Service, designed to protect, maintain and manage the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club clubhouse and other significant cottages in the historic district.  The 1889 South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historical Preservation Society was formed to be the principal community body working with the Park Service in the implementation of the plan.  Since the original planning efforts, the Society has obtained ownership of the Clubhouse, the Annex, the Moorehead Cottage, and the Brown Cottage.  These properties were not originally included within the boundary of the park because it was understood that a local entity could adequately provide for their protection and interpretation.         Unfortunately, the Society lacks the resources to continue to maintain the properties they own, let alone preserve and develop them according to approved plans.  The Society is struggling to make mortgage payments, and while they are desperately seeking a solution, the properties are deteriorating and losing historic integrity.  In 2000, the Society worked with a private, non-profit historic property development company to try and obtain private sector interest in purchasing the properties, but was not successful.  There is an imminent threat to the protection of these resources.  The private owner has already listed these historic structures and properties for sale on the open market.         In 2001, the National Park Service completed a special resource study and environmental assessment to evaluate options for protection and interpretation of the additional parcels of land.  Based upon the report, the Park Service proposed to add these parcels of land to the boundary of the park and to acquire the parcels in fee simple.  Within the village of Saint   Michael, four historically significant properties would be acquired.  These structures include the former clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, the Clubhouse Annex, and two cottages built by club members.  One undeveloped parcel, the Clubhouse Side-yard that sits between the Clubhouse and the Clubhouse Annex, would also be added.  The final parcel would protect the historic viewshed of the park, preserving the rural character of the Unger House property (Elias Unger was president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club), owned by the National Park Service.         If the Park Service acquired the historic buildings, we would explore the option of a public-private partnership to lease the buildings to the private sector for commercial and residential use. Through our historic leasing program, the private sector could sign a long-term lease with the Park Service that would cover a portion of the operations and maintenance costs of the properties, which ranges from $75,000 to $310,000.  In addition, the private sector could rehabilitate the buildings, estimated to cost upwards of $2.9 million, using private funds in return for federal historic preservation tax credits.  This would decrease the financial burden placed on the Park Service by the addition of these properties to the park. There has already been interest expressed by local businesses in this proposal.         The proposal to add these properties to the boundary of the park has widespread support among the property owners, state and local governments, and the public who attended a public meeting in July 2001 in Saint Michael.  Public comments received were unanimous in support of the proposal.         We look forward to working with the local communities in Saint Michael and Johnstown to acquire these historically significant properties that will help tell the entire story of the events of the 1889 Johnstown Flood, from the actions leading up to the flood through its devastating aftermath.         Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  This concludes my prepared remarks.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you or the members of the committee may have.
GX231-23-15049992	"April 2, 2003   City of Baltimore-Department of Planning 2002 CRITICAL AREA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SUMMARY AND BASIC DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION PACKAGE The State of Maryland Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Law establishes the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission (CAC) and requires that the City of Baltimore and other jurisdictions prepare and adopt a Critical Area Management Program (CAMP) to: (1) Improve the water quality of the Bay by controlling pollution from stormwater runoff and; (2) To conserve and protect wildlife habitat along the shoreline of the Bay. Date of the Program The City's Critical Area Management Program (CAMP) became effective with the adoption of Ordinance Nos. 1130, 1131, and 1132, effective January 4, 1988. The City's CAMP has most recently been reviewed, repealed and reordained by Ordinance 02-350, effective June 13, 2002 and approved by the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission on November 13, 2002. The terms and conditions contained herein reflect the most current amendments to the CAMP. Critical Area Boundaries and Sub-Areas The CAMP establishes guidelines for development of properties within the 1,000-foot strip of land measured from the mean high tide line or the bulkhead. The first 100 feet landward of the water is called the Buffer. The Critical Area is also separated into additional sub-areas (see the attached maps for boundaries). The sub-areas are: :  Intensely Developed Areas (IDA)  Resource Conservation Areas (RCA) An additional environmentally sensitive area within the Critical Area is the Designated Habitat Protection Areas. There are twelve Designated Habitat Protection Areas (DHPA) in the City of Baltimore. These areas function as additional overlay districts from the IDA and RCA areas and there may be some overlap on individual parcels; special protection requirements apply. These are by no means all of the important habitats effectively intermingled with industrial areas, interstates and neighborhoods in the City, but these DHPA's have been mapped and surveyed and are especially important habitat for seasonal waterfowl and as fish habitat areas. Please check with the Department of Planning if any special overlay district requirements affect your site. Critical Area Review Within the areas identified above, any of the following actions will trigger Critical Area review: 1) Building/Grading Permit 2) Rezoning 3) Subdivision   4) Conditional Use/ Special Exception 5) Zoning Variance After a preliminary review, Department of Planning staff will decide if a project is considered ""significant"" by the following criteria: 1) If there is any disturbance 2) If there is a disturbance of 3) If improvements are being base full cash value of the in the Buffer; 10,000 square feet outside the Buffer; or made to an existing structure that are 50% or more of the property.  Disturbance is defined as breaking the soil. Only significant development is subject to the special provisions or restrictions outlined below. ""Significant"" Project Process If a project is deemed significant, the following is the minimum that will be requested: a. Three copies of the site plan (use the Site Plan Review Committee Requirements list-in Section X); b. Three copies of the landscaping plan; c. Three copies of Worksheet A showing the proposed pollution reduction method (in Section X); d. Two copies of the Habitat Protection Assessment and the ""Habitat Assessment Field Form""[Worksheet""] if there will be any encroachment in a Designated Habitat Protection Area. These forms are available in the Planning Department. e. A copy of the CAMP Program Certification and Landscape Maintenance Agreement (in Section X). These must be copied onto the landscape plan and signed. f. Copy of the tree detail spliced onto the plans. Once the Department of Planning receives the above, the information is distributed to the Department of Public Works for a technical water quality review and to the Critical Area Commission in Annapolis as required by the Critical Area Act. The Department of Public Works will check the applicant's runoff pollution reduction requirements and the proposed best management practices. Determinations of Buffer establishment and all additional requirements are the responsibility of the Department of Planning. Once these agencies have specified how the project shall meet these requirements, the developer shall provide plans that comply with the requirements and/or provide a written statement of intent regarding any applicable offsets to the responsible Departments. When the developer has submitted development plans and/or a statement of intent regarding offsets, the Department of Planning will again review the plans for compliance to meet local Critical Area requirements. All developers will be required to meet any additional Building Code or other code requirements before the building permit is issued. Water Quality All significant development or redevelopment regardless of development area, shall reduce runoff pollution from the site by a minimum of 10%. If it can be demonstrated   that this is infeasible, developers are required to pay into an offset program managed by the Planning Department so that water quality improvement goals can be met elsewhere in the City's watershed. Buffer Requirements All significant development or redevelopment within the Buffer portion of the Critical Area is subject to special Buffer establishment and/or habitat protection requirements depending on the location of the property. Development within the Buffer is discouraged; disturbance within the Buffer is subject to a fee of at least $2.50 a square foot of disturbance. Funds raised are used to improve Buffer habitat in other portions of the watershed. Summary of Requirements within the Buffer Sub-Area IDA-Waterfront Revitalization SubAreas Developer Requirements  Developer may develop up to 100% of the Buffer area.  Developer must pay an offset fee for total Buffer area that is not landscaped/vegetated.  Does not pay Buffer offset fee for the area designated as ""promenade"". Water Dependent Use*  Developer may develop up to 100% of the Buffer area  Developer must pay an offset fee for total Buffer area that is not vegetated.  Removing 20% of pollutants (in Buffer) can be substituted for the Buffer fee. Non-Water Dependent Use  Developer may develop up to 50% of the Buffer provided: 1. Vegetation is planted on the remaining 50% of Buffer on-site or 2. Payment is made to the offset fund for all Buffer areas not vegetated. All land is either publicly owned parkland, a natural habitat area or restricted by floodplain regulations. Only water-dependent facilities for public use may be developed within the Buffer. Natural vegetation must be planted elsewhere in the Buffer equal to three times the land areas disturbed by any development. Offset $2.50 per square foot  IDA-Waterfront Industrial Areas  $2.50 per square foot  Resource Conservation Areas  $5.00 per square foot for the Buffer area developed  *Where the Buffer comprises 15% or more of the development site, the developer may develop as much as 100% of the Buffer, but must also offset for the total Buffer not vegetated. Any site where the Buffer is over 50% of the site, a maximum of 50% of the offset fee will be charged. Within the Waterfront Industrial Area and the Waterfront Revitalization Areas, Buffer offset costs shall not exceed 2% of the proposed new development or redevelopment costs. This does not include land costs.   Small Projects: As part of the 2002 CAMP review process, the Department of Planning made it a goal to simplify the process for smaller projects, especially when the projects were ""gut"" rehabilitations, etc. of existing rowhouses. The following regulations reflect those changes and better reflect the goals of the State's cutting edge Smart Growth legislation and specialized rehabilitation building code and the general goals to bring more citizens into the City and re-populate areas with existing infrastructure. Residential projects: Development activities on existing structures for residential use outside of the 100-foot Buffer on sites less than 1,500 S.F. do not pay offset fees even if the project activates the 50% assessment criteria. This does not apply to new subdivisions or new construction. Non-residential projects: Development activities on existing structures in Residential, Office-Residential and Business zoning districts for commercial use outside of the 100foot Buffer on sites less than 2,000 S.F. do not pay offset fees even if the project activates the 50% assessment criteria. This does not apply to new subdivisions or new construction. The CAMP Manual is online at: http://baltimorecity.gov/government/planning/available.html It must be viewed using Adobe Acrobat software, which is available on the WEB for free downloads. The Manual contains the Worksheet A (a copy is also attached for your convenience), planting specifications, and everything an applicant needs to meet the requirements. Detailed maps of the Critical Area are also available in the Department of Planning. VERY IMPORTANT: Please note that the City's CAMP and the separate Stormwater Quality Regulations administered by the Bureau of General Services, Department of Public Works, are indeed, SEPARATE regulations. The phosphorous removal required in the CAMP is different than the DPW regulations; offset fees are also calculated differently. Please be aware of these differences as you develop your project. For additional information and help with your submittal materials, please call Duncan Stuart, Critical Area Planner, in the Planning Department at 410-396-5902 or e-mail him at Duncan.stuart@baltimorecity.gov.

GX263-99-0411035	"VERMONT ENVIRONMENTAL BOARD 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151 Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406  Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order This is a petition for a declaratory ruling filed by Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity (Habitat) and the Burlington Housing Authority (BHA) concerning whether a Land Use Permit pursuant to 10 V.S.A.  6001-6092 (Act 250) is required for the construction of an eight-unit affordable housing project with related subdivision, on Venus Avenue in Burlington (Project). As set forth below, the Board finds that Act 250 jurisdiction attaches to the Project and that an Act 250 permit is therefore required. I. Procedural Summary  On January 18, 2002, the District 4 Environmental Commission Coordinator (Coordinator), at Habitat's request, issued Jurisdictional Opinion 4-175 (JO) in which he determined that the Project requires an Act 250 Land Use Permit. On February 28, 2002, the Coordinator issued a Reconsideration of JO 4-175, affirming the JO (Reconsidered JO). On March 19, 2002, Habitat and BHA filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling with the Environmental Board (Board), appealing the JO and the Reconsidered JO; they contend that the Project does not require an Act 250 permit. On April 18, 2002, Board Chair Marcy Harding convened a Prehearing Conference with the following participants: Habitat and BHA, by Neil Mickenberg, Esq. John Desautels and Katherine Desautels (formerly Katherine Gluck), by Michael J. Straub, Esq. June Garen, Beverly Senna, James P. Senna, Janet L. Prince, Robin E. Dayman, Kevin Greenblott, Robert D.

On April 19, 2002, Chair Harding issued a Prehearing Conference Report and Order (PCRO) identifying parties, the issue on appeal, and setting the case for hearing by a Panel of the Board. At the prehearing conference, the parties agreed to work together toward stipulating to the facts of the case, and the prehearing schedule was crafted accordingly. The parties did not file a stipulation of fact. Also at the prehearing conference, there was some discussion concerning whether Michael Straub would represent the entire group of Neighbors, or only John and Katherine Desautels. On April 25, 2002, Mr. Straub confirmed that he represents John and Katherine Desautels and that Ms. Desautels represents the Neighbors. On August 27, 2002, the parties filed a joint request to continue the hearing from September 4, 2002 to October 30, 2002. Also on August 27, 2002, Chair Harding issued a Continuance Order granting the parties' joint request. In accordance with the Continuance Order, a hearing panel of the Board convened a public hearing in this matter on October 30, 2002, took evidence from the parties. The Panel commenced deliberations immediately after the hearing and also on November 15, 2002. Based upon a thorough review of the record and related argument, the Panel issued a proposed decision on November 20, 2002, which was sent to the parties. The parties were allowed to file written objections and request oral argument before the Board on or before December 6, 2002. On December 6, 2002, Habitat and BHA filed an objection to the proposed decision and requested oral argument. On December 18, 2002, the Board heard oral argument and convened a deliberation concerning this matter. Following a review of the proposed decision and the evidence and arguments presented, the Board declared the record complete and adjourned. This matter is now ready for final decision.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 3  II.  Issue  Whether the Project constitutes a development and requires a land use permit pursuant to Act 250. III. Findings of Fact  To the extent that any proposed findings of fact are included within, they are granted; otherwise, they are denied. See Secretary, Agency of Natural Resources v. Upper Valley Regional Landfill Corp., 167 Vt. 228, 241-242 (1997); Petition of Village of Hardwick Electric Department, 143 Vt. 437, 445 (1983). Topic headings are for organizational purposes only. A. The Project  1. Habitat and BHA propose to build and sell four single-family residences and two duplex units (a total of eight units) at 140 Venus Avenue in Burlington. 2. No construction has taken place at the Venus Avenue Project site, and no site work has taken place. 3. The Project is located on a 2.3 - acre parcel.  4. BHA owns the 2.3 - acre parcel on which the Project will be located; Habitat owns none of the Project land. 5. The Project is legally structured as a condominium, and all of the unit owners will have an undivided interest in the common areas, including the land, a portion of which will be subject to a conservation easement to the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation. B. Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity  6. Habitat is a tax-exempt, Vermont non-profit corporation which is dedicated to the construction of affordable homes through the use of volunteers. 7. Directors. Habitat has one staff member and is governed by a volunteer Board of  8. Habitat receives grants from the Vermont Housing Conservation Board (VHCB), the Burlington Housing Trust Fund, and from foundations such as the Ronald McDonald foundation.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 4  C.  Other housing units constructed by Habitat  9. Habitat has built six housing units and is currently constructing a seventh housing unit within a five-mile radius of the Project within the past five years: a. a duplex at 660 North Avenue, sold by Habitat and recorded December 20, 2000; b. one single-family residence at 23 Allen Street, sold by Habitat on August 31, 2001 and recorded November 5, 2001; c. one single-family residence at 48 Batchelder Street, sold by Habitat on December 3, 1998 and recorded January 27, 1999; d. one single-family residence at 52 Batchelder Street sold, by Habitat on November 25, 1998 and recorded January 27, 1999 e. one single-family house at 176 South Champlain Street, sold by Habitat on June 4, 2002 and recorded June 17, 2002 f. one single-family unit, presently under construction on an existing lot on Sims Street, which Habitat plans to sell in late 2002 or early 2003 10. None of the seven other houses built by Habitat are contiguous to the Venus Avenue Project. 11. All of the seven other houses built by Habitat were built on existing lots; Habitat did not subdivide any lots in the course of building the other houses. 12. Each of the other houses built by Habitat , except the Sims Street house, was sold to a family as a private residence following construction. 13. Habitat has received zoning approval and other required city permits for the other seven houses it constructed, or is constructing. 14. Habitat has no single, overall ""development plan"" for the houses it constructs; rather, Habitat acts in an ad hoc mode -- if a lot becomes available and it is affordable, Habitat tries to acquire it to use as a building lot.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 5  D.  Funding for the Project and Habitat's other housing units  15. Part of the funding for the Project comes from a grant received by Habitat from VHCB, part comes from charitable donations, and part comes from mortgage payments to Habitat, which holds mortgages on housing units it constructs and sells. 16. The other seven housing units noted above were also partially funded by VHCB grants, charitable donations, and mortgage payments to Habitat, which holds the mortgages for these housing units. 17. In the construction of its houses, Habitat relies on volunteer work and occasionally contracts for certain work, such as electrical work. E. Burlington Housing Authority  18. BHA is a Vermont municipal housing authority within the city of Burlington which constructs affordable housing and assists low-income individuals and families in finding affordable housing. F. 19 Other housing units constructed by BHA During the past five years BHA has not subdivided any land for resale.  20. BHA constructed only one unit within the past five years, an apartment at the Franklin Square Apartment complex. 21. BHA did not participate in the development or construction of any of the other houses noted above which Habitat built. G. Burlington Development Review Board approval of the Project  22. The Burlington Development Review Board (DRB) conditioned its approval of the Project on several things, including a condition requiring that: Habitat and the Burlington Housing authority shall remain responsible as the original developer and applicant for this eight (8) unit PRD for any maintenance or permitting issue(s) for a period not to exceed three (3) years beyond the date of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the development. 23. The DRB acknowledged both Habitat and BHA as the original developer in its conditions of approval.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 6 24. H. The DRB approved the Project on February 20, 2001. Other city and state permits for the Project  25. BHA and Habitat applied jointly for city permits, including the zoning permit, for the Project. 26. The Public Water System Permit identifies BHA as the permittee; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. 27. The Project received subdivision approval from the City of Burlington on February 20, 2001, and was reviewed and approved under Burlington's subdivision ordinance; the subdivision permit identifies BHA as the landowner; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. 28. The state Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal Permit identifies BHA as the landowner; the record does not indicate the identity of the applicant. I. Relationship between Habitat and BHA relative to the Project  29. Habitat and BHA have entered into an Agreement which requires each organization to construct four of the eight units involved in the Project. 30. Under the Agreement, after Habitat constructs a unit, BHA will convey its interest in the unit and an undivided one-eighth interest in the common areas to Habitat. 31. Immediately following the conveyance from BHA, Habitat will convey the same property to a private homeowner. 32. Habitat will never own more than four of the units and will never own more than an undivided interest in one-half the common areas. 33. There is no present agreement between BHA and Habitat concerning which organization is responsible for building which unit. 34. units. 35. BHA will hire laborers to build its four units. Habitat is solely responsible for all costs associated with building its four  36. There will be no shared purchase of materials by BHA and Habitat in the construction of their units.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 7 37. The BHA units will be sold to homeowners along with an undivided oneeighth interest in the common areas for each unit. 38. Habitat and BHA are jointly responsible for obtaining grants to cover infrastructure associated with the Project; such grants will be made to Habitat and BHA jointly. 39. BHA and Habitat hold no joint escrow accounts or financial paper.  40. Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project. 41. Plans and studies submitted by Lamoureux and Dickinson, the engineering firm, include plans for all eight units in the Project. The plans are entitled ""Habitat for Humanity  8 Unit PRD."" 42. 43. Habitat. All housing units at the Project are of a common design. This Project is the only project in which BHA has worked directly with  44. When the Project concludes, BHA and Habitat will have no ownership interest in the land. 45. Upon their construction, a condominium association will be formed for the eight units; the association will hold the common land at the Project. 46. The Burlington Parks and Recreation Department will control the conservation land at the Project site. IV. Conclusions Of Law  The issue is whether the Project is a ""development."" Act 250 defines ""development"" to include: the construction of housing projects such as cooperatives, condominiums, or dwellings, or construction or maintenance of mobile homes or trailer parks, with 10 or more units, constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, and within a continuous period of five years. 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv); see also, EBR 2(A)(3)(defining ""development"").   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 8 To determine whether the Project is a development, it is helpful to break the definition of ""development,"" as it pertains to housing units, into its constituent elements. A. ""the construction of housing projects""  The Project is the construction of a housing project of eight units, although BHA and Habitat argue that only four units are attributable to each of them. B. ""with ten or more units""  Even if only four of the units at the Project are attributable to Habitat, those four units, added to the six units already constructed by Habitat, and the seventh unit under construction, put Habitat's portion of the Project over the ten unit threshold. C. ""constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land""  The Project is located on a 2.3 - acre parcel. D. ""owned or controlled""  BHA owns the 2.3-acre parcel where the Project is located; by virtue of its Agreement with BHA, Habitat exercises control over the parcel. See, In re Eastland, Inc., 151 Vt. 497 (1989); In re Lou R. Vitale, 151 Vt. 580 (1989). E. ""by a person""  EBR 2(H) defines ""person"" by reference to 10 V.S.A.  6001(14)(A) and (B). The statute, in turn, defines ""person"" to include "" . . . an individual, partnership, corporation, association, unincorporated organization, trust or other legal or commercial entity, including a joint venture or affiliated ownership...."" 10 V.S.A.  6001(14)(A)(i). A joint venture is a relationship between parties ""to engage in and carry out a single business venture for joint profit without any actual partnership or corporate designation."" Vermont Environmental Board v. Chickering, 155 Vt. 308, 317 (1990)(citations omitted). While, arguably, Habitat and BHA will each build, own, and sell their four units, a number of factors lead to the conclusion that the Project is a single business venture consisting of eight units. BHA and Habitat applied jointly for city permits for the Project. The Burlington DRB's approval, which acknowledges both Habitat and BHA as the Project's original developer, includes a condition which requires that Habitat and BHA ""remain responsible as the original developer and applicant for this eight (8) unit PRD for any   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 9 maintenance or permitting issue(s) for a period not to exceed three (3) years beyond the date of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the development."" Habitat and BHA have entered into an Agreement concerning the construction of the eight units involved in the Project. While Habitat will never own more than four of the units and will never own more than an undivided interest in one-half the common areas, and both Habitat and BHA are responsible for the financing for and construction of their discrete four units, the Agreement acknowledges that BHA has an interest in each of Habitat's four units, as it includes an understanding that, after Habitat constructs a unit, BHA will convey its interest in the unit to Habitat. Other factors indicate the closeness of the Habitat and BHA relationship as it concerns the Project. While BHA and Habitat hold no joint financial papers, they are jointly responsible for getting grants to cover infrastructure associated with the Project. Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project; plans submitted by the engineering firm include plans for all 8 units in the Project. Additionally, all housing units at the Project are of a common design. As it is clear that BHA and Habitat are acting in concert with respect to this Project, the Board concludes that it is a ""single business venture."" 1 1  Habitat takes issue with adding the seven other houses that Habitat built (see Findings of Fact, C) to the Project's eight units in order to reach the 10 unit threshold under 6001(3)(A)(4). It argues that ""the BHA/Habitat joint venture which constitutes the ""person"" under 10 V.S.A. 6001(3) is a different entity than Habitat, which alone built the seven Other Houses over the last five years."" To agree with Habitat's first argument  that a joint venture is a "" 'legal or commercial entity,' distinct from the individual acts of its separate members"" - would ignore the concept of ""person,"" under Act 250. It would allow an entity (like Habitat) to build nine houses and then, by creating a joint venture (Habitat/BHA) by joining itself to another organization (BHA), to build nine more houses within five miles and five years with no Act 250 jurisdiction attaching to the second project. This is exactly the sort of activity disapproved of in the Chickering case. Habitat argues next that the seven other houses cannot be attributed to the Project, since they were built only by Habitat. This argument would again separate out Habitat's individual acts from the Habitat/BHA joint venture. Again, this is contrary to the concept of ""person"" under the Act. It is Habitat's activities as a ""person"" that trigger jurisdiction over the Project; and Habitat must bring to the Project all of its prior acts, including the construction of the seven other houses. See, In re Spencer, 152 Vt. 330, 337  339 (1989) (""Spencer and wife"" do not comprise a separate ""person"" from ""Spencer and Vargas"" or Spencer, himself); Re: John W. Stevens and Bruce Gyles, Declaratory Ruling #240, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 11 (May 8,   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 10  While Habitat is a nonprofit corporation and BHA is a Vermont municipal housing authority, the Board also finds that the single business venture in which they are engaged is ""for joint profit."" There is nothing in the word ""profit"" that expressly limits its application to financial gain from sales alone.2 ""Profit"" can be found in avoided costs; here, Habitat profited by its association with BHA because Habitat did not need to spend funds to purchase the land for its four units, and BHA profited because Habitat paid for the engineering studies and plans for all of the eight units at the Project, including those to be built by BHA. The Board therefore concludes that BHA and Habitat are engaged in a joint venture in the development of the eight units on Venus Avenue and thus, for purposes of this Project, are the same ""person"" under Act 250 and the Board's Rules. F. ""within a radius of five miles""  The seven housing units constructed by Habitat are all within five miles of the Project. G. ""of any point on any involved land""  Habitat argues that the use of the term ""involved land"" connotes that there must be a relationship between the Project and the other housing units constructed by Habitat. The Neighbors reply that the term merely means that if a house sits on a  1992); Re: Marcel and Stella Roberts, Declaratory Ruling #265, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 10 (May 11, 1993); Re: Marcel Roberts and Noel Lussier, Declaratory Ruling #239, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 56 (May 11, 1993). In determining the meaning of terms used in a statute, one looks first to the statutory definitions; when, however, such terms are not defined, they ""are to be given their plain and commonly accepted meaning,"" Vincent v. State Retirement Board, 148 Vt. 531, 535 -36 (1987), as ""in the absence of compelling reasons to hold otherwise, it is assumed that the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory language was intended by the legislature."" State v. Young, 143 Vt. 413, 415 (1983). There is no definition of the word ""profit"" either in 10 V.S.A. Ch. 151 (Act 250), or in the statutory definitions found in 1 V.S.A. Ch. 3, subch. 2; thus, one may turn to the dictionary for assistance in defining the term. While the definition of ""profit"" most commonly is ""the gross proceeds of a business transaction less the costs of the transaction, i.e. net proceeds,"" it also includes the ""accession of good, valuable results [and] useful consequences...."" Black's Law Dictionary, (6th Ed., 1990). 2   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 11 portion of a lot, the five mile measurement is not made from the location of the house but from any point on the lot on which the house is located. The Neighbors have the more persuasive argument. In its decision in Re: Burlington Housing Authority, Declaratory Ruling #124, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (May 20, 1981), aff'd, In re Burlington Housing Authority, 143 Vt. 80, 83 (1983), the Board expressly rejected the application of the ""involved land"" 3 language which pertains to commercial or industrial construction ""involving"" more than ten acres, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(i), to the definition of ""development"" which pertains to housing units. 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv): We also reject petitioner's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in Committee to Save the Bishop's House v. Medical Center Hospital, 137 Vt. 142 (1979) exempts scattered housing projects from Act 250 jurisdiction unless a functional relationship exists among the sites that effect a significant impact under the environmental criteria of the Act. ... However, it is clear from the Bishop's House decision that parcels which are actually built upon are ""involved"" in the development, whatever the interrelationship among such parcels might be. See Bishop's House, 137 Vt. at 150. In the case of housing projects, this analysis makes a great deal of sense, since the legislature expressed its concern over the cumulative environmental and fiscal impacts of 10 or more new housing units in a certain area  e.g., effects on school enrollment, public utilities and services, water supplies and prime agricultural soils. These effects exist cumulatively with the development of the housing units, whether on one site or on many, totally apart from the interactive effects of one site on another. ... Burlington Housing Authority at 3. 4  Habitat argues that the Board has adopted a rule which defines ""involved land,"" EBR 2(F)(1), and that this definition must apply to the definition of development which  3 4  See EBR 2(F)(1).  Habitat also cites the Supreme Court case of In re Stokes Communications Corp., 164 Vt. 30, 36 (1995), in support of its ""involved land"" argument. Again, however, Stokes was a matter in which the definition of ""development"" now found in 10 V.S.A. 6003(A)(i) was at issue, not the definition pertaining to housing units in subsection (A)(iv).   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 12 pertains to ""housing units."" Habitat asserts that a failure to do so violates the Administrative Procedures Act, 3 V.S.A. Ch. 25 (APA). 5 Habitat's claim ignores the rationale of the earlier Burlington Housing Authority case. As is clear from the Burlington Housing Authority decision, the Board has earlier specifically rejected the arguments now raised by Habitat, finding that there need not be conclusion that ""a functional relationship exists among the sites that effect a significant impact under the environmental criteria of the Act."" Id. The Board also notes Burlington Housing Authority's emphasis on the cumulative impacts caused by housing construction, which exists even if there is no functional relationship between the different housing sites. The term ""involved land"" has been used by the Board solely in terms of computing relevant acreage when determining whether a project ""involves"" more than one or ten acres of land. There is a distinction between the way the term ""involved land"" is used for commercial or industrial development and the way it is used for housing projects. Section 6001(3)(A)(i) states that ""development"" means: i) The construction of improvements on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, involving more than 10 acres of land within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, for commercial or industrial purposes in a municipality that has adopted permanent zoning and subdivision bylaws. As is apparent from the language of the statute, development for commercial or industrial purposes in a more than 10 acres of land; the focus under the statute parcels of land, as, if less than 10 acres are ""involved,"" to be subject to Act 250, ""ten-acre"" town must involve is the size of the parcel or there is no Act 250 jurisdiction.  By contrast, 6001(3)(A)(iv) states that ""development"" means To agree with Habitat's apparent claim of error regarding the APA - that the Panel's decision writes a new rule which has not gone through the APA process - would mean that the Board could never, in a decision, establish a definition for a term. This makes little sense, as it would mean that the Board could never make a decision as to the meaning of a word or a term in Act 250, if the word had not already been defined by a rule. While, in light of this case and Habitat's argument, it might be advisable for the Board to consider writing such a rule to apply to housing projects, the present nonexistence of such a rule does not render the Board's actions illegal. The Board notes further that the definition of ""involved land"" that Habitat promotes  one which integrate the ""common-sense criteria""  was also not adopted through the APA process. 5   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 13  (iv) The construction of housing projects such as cooperatives, condominiums, or dwellings, or construction or maintenance of mobile homes or trailer parks, with 10 or more units, constructed or maintained on a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land, and within any continuous period of five years. The requirement that the development must involve parcels which comprise more than 10 acres of land does not exist for jurisdiction over housing projects; rather, the number of units is the primary concern, not the acreage on which they sit, either collectively or individually. Burlington Housing Authority tells us that every house sits on its own parcel or parcels of ""involved land,"" and the only question is whether any point on such a parcel is within five miles of other parcels. 6 Lastly, the specific language of the definition of ""involved land"" in EBR 2(F)(1) makes it clear that it cannot apply to housing unit development: (1) The entire tract or tracts of land, within a radius of five miles, upon which the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes will occur, and any other tract, within a radius of five miles, to be used as part of the project or where there is a relationship to the tract or tracts upon which the construction of improvements will occur such that there is a demonstrable likelihood that the impact on the values sought to be protected by Act 250 will be substantially affected by reason of that relationship. In the event that a commercial or industrial project is to be completed in stages according to a plan, or is part of a larger undertaking, Despite Habitat's claim that the Board's decision today ignores the existence of the words ""involved land"" in the statute, the concepts embodied in the EBR 2(F)(1) definition of ""involved land"" are applicable to housing unit development and can be used when considering jurisdiction. The ""involved land"" analysis in Rule 2(F)(1) may encompass a situation in which a house is built on Lot A, but has its primary or secondary leachfield located on Lot B, a separate lot. Lot B may not be contiguous to Lot A; Lot B may not even be owned by the owner of Lot A; it need only be controlled by such owner. In such an example, Lot B would be considered to be ""involved land"" with Lot A, and if Lot B is within five miles of other housing unit lots, then the house on Lot A house will be counted as a housing unit under 6001(3)(A)(iv), even if Lot A itself is not within the five-mile radius. Thus, while Habitat argues that our decision strikes the term ""involved land"" from the statute, we do not ignore the existence of those words. We merely interpret them differently than what Habitat would prefer. 6   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 14 all land involved in the entire project shall be included for the purpose of determining jurisdiction. EBR 2(F)(1) (emphasis added). The particular reference in Rule 2(F)(1) to ""the construction of improvements for commercial or industrial purposes"" indicates the types of development - those referenced in 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(i), (ii) and (iii)  to which the Rule applies. Since housing unit development is a different animal, one which is not included within the legislature's ""commercial or industrial purposes"" category, the definition in Rule 2(F)(1) is inapposite. Habitat raises a stronger claim with its ""single project"" argument, one which is based both on the Burlington Housing Authority case, as affirmed, and the later decision in Re: Trono Construction Co., Inc., Declaratory Ruling 149, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (May 23, 1984), aff'd, In re Trono Construction Co., 146 Vt. 591 (1986). In these cases, the Board and Vermont Supreme Court looked to whether housing projects on separate tracts ""are so closely related as to constitute a single 'development' for purposes of Act 250."" In re Trono Construction Co., 146 Vt. at 592. Trono involved two housing projects on separate parcels of land in Burlington. The developer obtained an Act 250 permit for one project (twelve units on College Street), completed construction and began selling units, and then commenced construction on a nine-unit housing project on North Union Street, within 5 miles of the first project. The Court affirmed the Board's decision that ""the mixture of the timing of the projects and common ownership brought [the] second development project within the strictures of Act 250."" Id. The Court noted that the Board had considered ""common sense criteria"" to determine whether different housing projects constitute a single development, such as common ownership or management, common funding, shared facilities, and contiguity in time of development. 7 7  Because Trono cites the ""criteria"" approvingly, Habitat argues that the Panel is therefore ""overturning"" the Court's Trono decision. The Board disagrees.  The Supreme Court's Trono decision did not establish a test that must be followed in all subsequent cases. Rather, the court simply affirmed the test that the Board decided to apply. This does not mean that if the Board chooses to apply a different test, the Court would disallow it because it was not the same test as had been applied in Trono. Indeed, as more fully discussed below, in 1990, the legislature amended the definition of housing unit to add the ""five year"" requirement, something that did not exist at the time of the Court's 1986 Trono decision. Certainly, this amendment allows the Board to undertake a new analysis of 6001(3)(A)(iv), free from the language of the Court's decision. The Board is therefore not ""overturning"" the Trono decision; it is merely interpreting the meaning of the law in light of the legislative change.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 15  Trono, both at the Board and in the Supreme Court, was based on the Board's earlier, May 1981 Burlington Housing Authority decision, which, for the first time, introduced the ""common sense criteria"" test to the housing unit definition in response to an argument that had been presented to the Board: Petitioner argues that our finding that a housing project may exist on scattered sites will subject to Act 250 jurisdiction any developer who builds more than 10 units of any type at any time within a five mile radius..... a. We do not hold that any builder who has constructed 10 or more units will automatically trigger Act 250 jurisdiction with each new unit to be constructed within the necessary geographical radius. A developer may, over time, build and sell a number of different housing projects in scattered locations. Several common-sense criteria may be used to determine whether any of these scattered developments would comprise a related housing project. Such indications would include: retained common ownership or management, common funding, shared facilities, and contiguity in time of development. ... Burlington Housing Authority, at 2 (emphasis added). 8 It is apparent from the above language from Burlington Housing Authority that the principal concern of the petitioner in that matter was the ""ultimate scenario"" claim that housing units built 20 or 30 years apart could be added together to trigger jurisdiction. 9 The Board's measured reply  and its decision to link scattered housing projects together through an initiative based on ""common-sense criteria""  can be seen as a rational response to that concern.  Subsequent reference to these criteria, within a ten-acre ""involved land"" analysis and not an analysis of ""development"" pertaining to housing projects, appears in Re: Town of Wilmington, Declaratory Ruling #258, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 10 (Jun. 30, 1992). And, see, Re: Lake Realty, #9A0175-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 6 (Oct. 20, 1989). These criteria were also noted in William Dibbern, #5R0194-1-EB, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 5 (July 16, 1981). 9  8  The petitioner also expressed a concern that jurisdiction would attach to ""any person who merely owned 10 or more units within a five mile radius,"" but the Board quickly dismissed that fear, noting that ""mere ownership does not constitute a 'development' under 6001(3)."" Burlington Housing Authority at 2  3.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 16 The question is whether these ""common-sense criteria"" remain as critical a component to determining jurisdiction over housing projects today as they were in the early 1980s. Several considerations provide an answer. First, the use of the word ""may"" in the Board's Burlington Housing Authority decision indicates that, in the absence of other factors, the ""common sense criteria"" provide guidance to the Board's jurisdictional determination. Although Habitat dismisses it as immaterial to the ""single project"" question raised herein, it is nonetheless significant to note that Act 250 was amended in 1990 (after all the decisions in Burlington Housing Authority and Trono) to add the words ""and within any continuous period of five years"" to the definition of housing unit ""development."" Act No. 234, 3 (1989 Adj. Sess., eff. June 4, 1990). Thus, as one of the ""common-sense criteria"" specifically noted in the Burlington Housing Authority decision - contiguity in time of development  was specifically addressed and limited by the Legislature, the single, principal fear presented by the Burlington Housing Authority petitioner no longer exists, and the Board need no longer rely on such criteria as a protection against an unwarranted extension or overreaching of Act 250's housing project jurisdiction. 10 Second, the Board presumes that the legislature intended the plain meaning of the statutory language. Re: Vermont Egg Farms, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #317, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 8 (Jun. 14, 1996), citing Bisson v. Ward, 160 Vt. 343, 348 (1993). Therefore, if the meaning of the statute is plain on its face, the Board enforces the statute according to its express terms. Vermont Egg Farms, Inc., at 8, citing Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Dept. of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 335-36 (1990). The plain language of the statute, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv), contains no requirement that housing units on different parcels must be linked together as a single project before jurisdiction will be triggered. To the contrary, the statute sets up only certain factors that must be present to create jurisdiction: the construction of ten or 10  It is interesting to note that the 1990 amendment which added the five-year requirement may also have been in response to the Board's decision in Re: Harold Jacobs, Declaratory Ruling #210, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order at 2 (Sept. 28, 1989), in which the Board held that there were no time frame limits within the definition of ""development"" pertaining to housing units. Additionally, the Harold Jacobs decision makes no mention of the ""commonsense criteria"" established by Burlington Housing Authority. Two other related Board decisions, one issued before and one issued after the 1990 amendment, also ignore those criteria. Re: Bradford Moore / S.D.L. Enterprises, Inc., Declaratory Ruling #205, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (Apr. 24, 1990); Re: Richard Farnham, Declaratory Ruling #250, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order (July 17, 1992). The Board's application of the ""common sense criteria,"" therefore, has not been consistent.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 17 more housing units, on land owned or controlled by a person, within five miles and five years of each other. Those factors are all present in the instant case. 11 Third, the elements which appear in 6001(3)(A)(iv) are virtually identical to those which appear in the definition of ""subdivision,"" 10 V.S.A. 6001(19): ""a tract or tracts of land, owned or controlled by a person, which the person has partitioned or divided for the purpose of resale into 10 or more lots within a radius of five miles of any point on any lot, ... within any continuous period of five years."" When determining whether the partitioning of lots on separate tracts constitutes a ""subdivision,"" the Board does not require that any common elements (ownership, funding, etc.) exist between those separate tracts; the Board only looks to elements of statute and not to whether there is some sort of relationship between the lots. The Board also notes that the recent amendment to ""development,"" relating to the construction of housing units likewise simply counts units constructed by a person within See, 10 V.S.A. 6001(C). 12 Again, the legislature has not 11  the definition of in designated downtowns, five years and five miles. required that there be any  Habitat contends that our decision violates the limitations on Board jurisdiction imposed by the Supreme Court's Bishop's House decision - - that Act 250 jurisdiction attaches ""only where activity on a very major scale is planned."" 137 Vt. at 151. But it is the legislature which decides the ""scale"" of developments which will be subject to Act 250 jurisdiction; here, 6001(3)(A)(iv) contains certain elements, such as ownership, distance and time, and as long as a project meets the language of that section, the law applies. 12  Section 6001(C) reads: (C) For the purposes of determining jurisdiction under subdivisions (3)(A) and (3)(B) of this section: (i) Housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside a designated downtown development district shall not be counted to determine jurisdiction over housing units constructed by a person entirely within a designated downtown development district. (ii) Within any continuous period of five years, housing units constructed by a person entirely within a designated downtown district shall be counted together with housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside a designated downtown development district to determine jurisdiction over the housing units constructed by a person partially or completely outside the designated downtown development district and within a five-mile radius.   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 18 relationship between the housing units that are considered for purposes of determining jurisdiction. 13 The Vermont Supreme Court has held that ""when the same words are used in different sections of the same statute they will bear the same meaning throughout, unless it is apparent that another meaning was intended...."" Billings v. Billings, 114 Vt. 512, 517 (1946); accord, State v. Welch, 135 Vt. 316, 321 (1977). The Board believes that the fact that the legislature requires no linkage between lots counted for purposes of determining the existence of a ""subdivision"" or units counted for purposes of determining jurisdiction for downtown housing, no linkage is required under a straight reading of 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv). Fourth, in terms of their environmental impact on the criteria listed in 10 V.S.A. 6086(a), under some circumstances there may be no difference between a residential subdivision and an equal number of single family housing units on tracts of common land. Whether or not they are related by ""common sense criteria,"" housing units on common land may have the same environmental impacts as houses which are each on their own separate lots. 14 Because the environmental impacts can be identical, there is (iii) All housing units constructed by a person within a designated downtown development district within any continuous period of five years, commencing on or after the effective date of this subdivision, shall be counted together. Habitat argues that the legislative history of the 1990 amendment reveals that its purpose was to protect developers from Act 250 jurisdiction in relation to housing that was constructed over an extended period, and that the Panel's use of the amendment to expand jurisdiction turns this purpose on its head. The Board disagrees. The decision today recognizes that the 1990 amendment is a protection for developers. The decision is a statement that the ""five year"" test replaces the ""common-sense criteria"" that had earlier been established in the Burlington Housing Authority decision as an attempt to address a complaint that there was no time limitation in the law as it previously existed. To adopt Habitat's claim would mean that not only does the ""five year"" requirement exist, but also all of the ""criteria"" would still apply, even though two of the ""criteria"" (common ownership or management and contiguity in time of development) specifically relate to time sensitive issues. Habitat asserts that these ""cumulative effect"" considerations can apply equally to commercial or industrial developments which together exceed 10 acres, but the Supreme Court's Bishop's House decision rejects this approach. It was within the context of determining acreage involved in a project that the Bishop's House case was decided. The case did not concern the question of how to 14 13   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 19 no reason to treat subdivisions and housing unit developments differently for jurisdictional purposes. 15 Lastly, the ramifications of requiring a ""common sense criteria"" relationship between housing units could allow a person to build nine housing units, sell the last unit, commence construction on the next nine units, ad infinitum, as long as he was careful to obtain funding from different banks. The five-year test would thus be rendered surplusage, contrary to general rules of statutory construction. ""In construing a statute, every part of the statute must be considered, and every word, clause, and sentence given effect if possible."" State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 481 (1979); Slocum et al. v. Department of Social Welfare, 154 Vt. 474 (1990); State v. Tierney, 138 Vt. 163, 165 (1980); State v. Racine, 133 Vt. 111, 114 (1974) (court ""must presume that all language is inserted in a statute advisedly""). The Board therefore concludes that the plain language of the 1990 amendment supercedes the ""common-sense criteria"" originally enumerated in the 1981 Burlington Housing Authority decision. 16 measure the distances between housing units, which is what the ""involved land"" language in 6001(3)(A)(iv) addresses. The Board also notes that the ""cumulative effect"" argument appears in the earlier Burlington Housing Authority decision; the Board did not create it for this decision. 15  Habitat contends that housing projects should not be equated with subdivisions because the definition of ""subdivision"" does not include a reference to ""involved land."" While this is true, if one considers that the use of the word ""involved land"" in the definition of housing projects relates to distances between the parcels on which the individual houses sit, and not the size of those parcels, then the fact that the definition of ""subdivision"" does not include a reference to ""involved land"" is not material to our decision. Further, by its very nature, all of the land in a subdivision is ""involved land;"" there is simply no need or reason to refer to the concept of ""involved land"" within the definition of ""subdivision.""  Habitat claims that, even if Trono's ""contiguity in time of development"" criterion is addressed by the 1990 amendment, the other ""criteria"" required by Trono still exist. Again, however, as noted above, the Trono decision does not establish any requirements that the Board must follow; it merely reaffirms those that the Board chose to apply back in the mid-1980s. Nothing prohibits the Board from finding that the 1990 amendment supercedes earlier requirements in their entirety. Further, Habitat ignores all of the other reasons as to why the ""common-sense criteria"" should be abandoned. Nor can the Board agree with Habitat's contention that its citation to Trono in the Board's later Town of Wilmington decision, supra, note 8, means that the Board was  16   Re: Green Mountain Habitat for Humanity, Inc., and Burlington Housing Authority Declaratory Ruling #406 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Page 20  H.  ""and within a continuous period of five years.""  Habitat's seven other houses were all built within the past five years. Conclusion The Project meets the definition of a housing unit ""development."" V. Order 17  The Project constitutes a development, jurisdiction is triggered, and an Act 250 Land Use Permit is required. Dated at Montpelier, Vermont this 31st day of December 2002.

The Town of Wilmington case merely mentions (within the context of a 10-acre ""involved land"" analysis) the '""criteria"" noted in Trono. This mention is hardly of any note. Habitat notes that the biggest obstacle to building affordable housing in Vermont is the objection of neighbors. While the Board recognizes and lauds Habitat's goals and purposes and realizes that its decision today may make those goals more difficult to achieve, the section of the law at issue here, 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(A)(iv), makes no distinction between affordable housing and market rate housing. The only provision of Act 250 that provides special dispensation for the construction of affordable housing appears in 10 V.S.A. 6001(3)(B), and, if further exceptions to the law for the benefit of affordable housing projects are to be made, they must also be legislative in origin. 17"

Rowe ) Administrative Law  99-PT-0003 attachment attachment  Judge  RECOMMENDATION FOR DISPOSITION  Appearances: LeGrand L. Malany, Attorney at Law, for Habitat for Humanity.  Synopsis: The hearing in this matter was held in Springfield, Illinois on May 3, 1999, to determine whether or not Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 1427.0-177-046, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257-018, 22-02.0-257-019, 22-02.0257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, and 14-27.0-254-020 qualified for exemption during the 1998 assessment year. Jan Sorenson, 1997 president and current past president of Habitat for Humanity of Sangamon County (hereinafter referred to as the ""Applicant"") was present and testified on behalf of the applicant. The issues in this matter include: first, whether the applicant was the owner of these parcels during the 1998 assessment year; secondly, whether the applicant is a charitable  1   organization; and lastly, whether these parcels were used by the applicant for charitable purposes during the 1998 assessment year. Following the submission of all the evidence and a review of the record, it is determined that the applicant owned these parcels during all of the 1998 assessment year. It is also determined that the applicant is a charitable organization. Finally, it is determined that the applicant did not use the vacant parcels for exempt purposes during the 1998 assessment year. Regarding Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, it is determined that the applicant has established that it was used for exempt purposes for 65% of the 1998 assessment year. It is therefore recommended that Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257-018, 22-02.0-257-019, 2202.0-257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, and 14-27.0-254-020 remain on the tax rolls for 1998 and be assessed to the applicant the owner thereof. It is also recommended that Parcel Index No. 1427.0-177-046 be exempt for 65% of the 1998 assessment year.  Findings of Fact: 1. The jurisdiction and position of the Department that Sangamon County Parcel  Index Nos. 22-02.0-305-015, 22-02.0-305-014, 14-26.0-301-013, 22-02.0-257-017, 22-02.0-257018, 22-02.0-257-019, 22-02.0-257-020, 22-02.0-257-026, 14-27.0-254-020 and 44% of Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046 did not qualify for a property tax exemption for the 1998 assessment year was established by the admission into evidence of Dept. Ex. Nos. 1 through 14. (Tr. p. 14) 2. The applicant was incorporated under the General Not for Profit Corporation Act  of the State of Illinois on May 22, 1989. The mission of the applicant is: to eliminate poverty housing by building simple, decent, affordable housing for working families in need. To be eligible to receive a Habitat home, the Habitat family must have a family income of between 35 and 65% of the median family income for the City of Springfield as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Habitat homes are built through the use of donated funds, donated materials, and volunteer labor. Where labor and materials must be purchased, they are purchased with funds raised by Habitat for Humanity through donations. Once a home is built, it is deeded to the homeowner at our cost of construction. Habitat finances a  2   Habitat family home by a zero interest five to six homes per year. Although homes, we do purchase or get donated Habitat program is the same for new (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 3.  mortgage. We are currently building we generally have been building new older homes which we remodel. The construction as it is for remodeling.  The applicant acquires real estate to be used in its Habitat home building program.  The applicant obtains real estate through purchases, gifts, and donations. Some are received from the city of Springfield through various economic development programs. The real estate that the applicant purchases is usually vacant lots, which can be utilized as home building lots. The applicant never knows exactly when a property will be needed. The applicant holds parcels in inventory until one of its families is approved for home construction. In order to qualify for approval a family needs 250 sweat equity hours for each adult in the family. Once approved, the family chooses a lot for its new home. Volunteers of the applicant begin construction on the home. Once the home is completed, the Habitat family moves in. The house is then deeded to the Habitat family at no interest and at the applicant's cost. The deeding process takes additional time. From the time the applicant receives a piece of property until it is disposed of may be as long as four years. (Dept. Ex. No. 2; Tr. pp. 22, 26-28) 4. The Habitat family finds the applicant either through word of mouth or through  the applicant's advertising and family orientation programs. (Tr. p. 22) 5. The bylaws of the applicant state that:  Habitat for Humanity - Sangamon County shall seek to sponsor specific projects in habitat development in Sangamon County, Illinois, starting with the construction of modest but adequate housing, and to associate with other groups functioning with purposes consistent with those listed below, namely: a. to work with economically disadvantaged people to help them create a better human habitat in which to live and work. b. to cooperate with other charitable organizations, through grants and otherwise, which are working to develop a better habitat for economically disadvantaged people. c. to communicate our faith in God by means of our words and actions as we work in partnership with God and people building homes  3   and community. d. to enable an expanding number of persons from all walks of life to participate in this ministry. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 6. The applicant is exempt from the payment of federal Income Taxes pursuant to a  group determination by the Internal Revenue Service that the applicant qualifies as the type of organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 7. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-305-015 by a quitclaim deed on  December 24, 1996. The property is commonly known as 1900 East Cornell Street, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998, the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 2) 8. The applicant also acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-305-014 by a quitclaim  deed on December 24, 1996. The property is commonly known as 1828 East Cornell Street, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998, the property was a vacant lot. (Dept. Ex. No. 3) 9. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046 on December 29, 1995,  by a warranty deed. The property was donated to the applicant as a gift. The property is commonly known as 801 North 7th Street, Springfield, Illinois. When the applicant acquired the property it contained a one-story commercial building that was vacant. It had been used as a medical office. From 1996 until February 1998 the applicant used the parcel as a construction site for a house on an adjoining parcel, for storage of construction materials, storage of materials for applicant's fundraisers, and as an office. The applicant moved out of the building on  February 2, 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 4; Tr. pp. 16-19) 10. On June 11, 1998, the applicant obtained a demolition permit for ""interior gutting  single family residence"" at 801 N. 7th Street. Construction was started on or about June 13, 1998, and substantially completed by mid-September. On July 15, 1998, the applicant was  issued a building permit to ""remodel interior, & new truss roof, SFR house #38"" at 801 North 7th Street. Applicant's construction, remodeling, and utility costs for job #38 totaled $65,270.99 including the cost of the land and insurance. The applicant knew the property was worth about $50,000.00 and did approximately $20,000.00 to $25,000.00 worth of rehabilitation. On August  4   16, 1998, the applicant sold the property and home by a lease with the option to purchase to a family that qualified for applicant's program. The mortgage had not been signed at the time of the hearing. The family was delinquent on the lease payments. (Dept. Ex. No. 4; Tr. pp. 16-19, 21) 11. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-26.0-301-013 on December 30, 1995,  by a warranty deed. The property was donated to the applicant as a gift. The property is commonly known as 1515 East Miller, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was a vacant lot. (Dept. Ex. No. 5) 12. On July 22, 1996, the applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-017 by a  warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1828 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 6) 13. Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-018 was acquired by the applicant on July 22, 1996  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1824 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. The property was a vacant lot in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 7) 14. The applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-019 on July 22, 1996, by a  warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1820 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 8) 15. The applicant also acquired Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-020 on July 22, 1996,  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1816 Perkins Court. The property was a vacant lot in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 9) 16. Parcel Index No. 22-02.0-257-026 was acquired by the applicant on July 22, 1996  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1800 Perkins Court, Springfield, Illinois. In 1998 the property was vacant land. (Dept. Ex. No. 10) 17. On October 21, 1994, the applicant acquired Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-254-020  by a warranty deed. The property is commonly known as 1011 North 12th Street, Springfield, Illinois. The property contained an abandoned house and was vacant in 1998. (Dept. Ex. No. 11)  5   18.  None of the parcels at issue required zoning changes. In 1998 the applicant  cleaned up the vacant lots and mowed them. (Tr. p. 28) 19. I take administrative notice that the Department granted the applicant a partial  exemption for 1998 in Docket No. 98-84-46, which concerns Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, street address 801 N. 7th. Conclusions of Law: Article IX, 6 of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, provides in part as follows: The General Assembly by law may exempt from taxation only the property of the State, units of local government and school districts and property used exclusively for agricultural and horticultural societies, and for school, religious, cemetery and charitable purposes. This provision is not self-executing but merely authorizes the General Assembly to enact legislation that exempts property within the constitutional limitations imposed. City of Chicago v. Illinois Department of Revenue, 147 Ill.2d 484 (1992) Pursuant to the constitutional grant of authority, the legislature has enacted provisions for property tax exemptions. At issue is the provision found at 35 ILCS 200/15-65, which exempts certain property from taxation as follows: All property of the following is exempt when actually and exclusively used for charitable or beneficent purposes, and not leased or otherwise used with a view to profit: (a) Institutions of public charity. (b) Beneficent and charitable organizations incorporated in any state of the United States, . . . It is well settled in Illinois that when a statute purports to grant an exemption from taxation, the tax exemption provision is to be construed strictly against the one who asserts the claim of exemption. International College of Surgeons v. Brenza, 8 Ill.2d 141 (1956) Whenever doubt arises, it is to be resolved against exemption and in favor of taxation. People ex. rel. Goodman v. University of Illinois Foundation, 388 Ill. 363 (1941). Further, in ascertaining  6   whether or not a property is statutorily tax exempt, the burden of establishing the right to the exemption is on the one who claims the exemption. MacMurray College v. Wright, 38 Ill.2d 272 (1967) The Department granted the applicant a partial exemption pursuant to Docket No. 98-8446, Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, address 801 N. 7th Street. Therefore, the Department has determined that the applicant is a charitable organization. The only question before me is whether the applicant used the subject properties for charitable purposes during the 1998 assessment year. With regard to all the properties other than Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-177-046, street address 801 N. 7th St., the applicant did not use the parcels at all in 1998. They were vacant lots. The Illinois Appellate Court found that a church-owned building, which was not used for any purpose and was boarded up during the taxable years in question, did not qualify for a property tax exemption for those years. Antioch Missionary Baptist Church v. Rosewell, 119 Ill.App.3d 981 (1st Dist. 1983). In addition, the Fifth District Appellate Court held that eighteen vacant lots did not qualify for a property tax exemption in Comp. Train. & Devel. v. Co. of Jackson, 261 Ill.App.3d 37 (5th Dist. 1994). In the v. case The 311 of People ex. rel. of the  Pearsal  Catholic Ill. 11  Bishop  Chicago,  (1924),  Illinois Supreme Court held that the mere fact that a property was intended to be used for an exempt purpose was not sufficient to exempt said property. Court required that the The  actual  primary exempt use must have begun for the property to be exempt. Regarding Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-117-046, the 801 N. 7 th  Street  7   property, the applicant used it from the time of acquisition until February 2, 1998, for storage and construction projects associated with its charitable purpose. The Appellate Court of Illinois has determined that property owned by a church and used for storage of church records and furniture qualified for a property tax exemption in Our Savior Lutheran Church v. Department of Revenue, 204 Ill.App.3d 1055 (5th Dist. 1990), leave to appeal denied. It is therefore  recommended that the property qualify for exemption from January 1, 1998, through February 2, 1998. However, the applicant has failed to establish that Parcel Index No. 14-27.0-117-046 qualifies for exemption for the period of February 2, 1998, through June 11, 1998, or for 35% of the 1998 assessment year. The Department previously determined that the property qualified for exemption from June 11, 1998. Based upon the foregoing, I find that the applicant has failed to establish that it used the vacant subject parcels for charitable purposes in 1998. I therefore recommend that Sangamon County Parcel Index Nos.: 22-02.0-305-015 located at 1900 E. Cornell; 22-02.0-305-014 address 1828 E. Cornell; 14-26.0-301-013 a/k/a 1515 E. Miller; 22-02.0-257-017, which is 1828 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-018 located at 1824 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-019, a/k/a 1820 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-020, which is 1816 Perkins Court; 22-02.0-257-026, the address of which is 1800 Perkins Court; and 14-27.0-254-020, located at 1011 N. 12th Street, remain on the tax rolls for be the entire to 1998 the  taxable  year  and  assessed  applicant, the owner thereof.
