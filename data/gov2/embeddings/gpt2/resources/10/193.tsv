GX094-82-7729849	"Census Bureau Section 515 Information Quality Guidelines                 The Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency of the Federal Government.  While best   known for the decennial census of population and housing, it conducts other surveys and   censuses that measure changing individual and household demographics and the economic   condition of the Nation.  The Census Bureau is responsible for quinquennial censuses of   manufactures, retail trade, wholesale trade, service industries, finance, insurance, real estate,   transportation, communication, utilities, mining, and governments.  The Census Bureau also   conducts approximately 200 surveys per year.  It is the source of household demographic surveys   sponsored by other Federal agencies, as well as by the Census Bureau.  It is also the source of the   country's official population estimates and projections that are used as the basis for allocating   federal funds each year.  Monthly, quarterly, and annual establishment surveys are funded by   Congressional appropriation to yield information on the current state of the economy.  Census   Bureau economic surveys provide a majority of the information the Bureau of Economic   Analysis uses to update Gross Domestic Product estimates, the data used by the Bureau of Labor   Statistics in reporting Producer Price changes, and the data used by the Federal Reserve Board as   input to indices of industrial production and capacity utilization.       Census Bureau programs support Department of Commerce Strategic Planning Goal 1:  Provide   the Information and the Framework to Enable the Economy to Operate Efficiently and Equitably ,   Objective 1.3:  Support Effective Decision-Making of Policymakers, Businesses, and the   American Public .       High quality publicly available statistics from Federal statistical organizations are essential for a   nation to advance the economic well-being and quality of life of its people. The statistical   information products provided by the Bureau of the Census are influential, shaping important   policy decisions that help improve our Nation's social and economic conditions:            Census Bureau data are used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding.       Census Bureau data are essential for estimating the gross domestic product (GDP) and     leading economic indicators.       Census Bureau data determine the apportionment of Congressional seats, as mandated in the     Constitution.       Census Bureau data inform us about education, income, poverty, and health insurance     coverage.       National, state, and local governments use Census Bureau data to formulate policy.       Large corporations and local businesses use Census Bureau data to devise their business     plans.             The Census Bureau is one of 10 principal statistical agencies in the Federal government. A   statistical agency, as defined in the  Federal Register  January 29, 1996 (Volume 61, Number 20,   pages 2875-2879), is an agency or organizational unit of the Executive Branch whose activities   are predominantly the collection, compilation, processing or analysis of information for   statistical purposes.  Statistical agencies have long been leaders in the development and   implementation of quality guidelines for information products.         The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in its February 22, 2002 issuance of   government-wide information quality guidelines, recognizes that Federal statistical organizations   provide a substantial variety of data.  Accordingly, while the Census Bureau is part of       a joint   Federal statistical agency notice on information quality guidelines , it presents its specific response to the   OMB directive on quality, including utility, objectivity, and integrity.  The Census Bureau considers   its published statistical information to be ""influential,"" and does not distinguish among the many data   it releases annually those which are more or less influential.  The original and supporting data it   collects and develops to generate its statistical information products are covered by the same   quality guidelines as the information it disseminates, and are proprietary and confidential.    The Census Bureau will demonstrate in its Paperwork Reduction Act clearance packages that each such draft information    collection will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with all applicable   information quality guidelines.  Analyses it conducts that become part of Census Bureau statistical information products are   covered by the same quality guidelines.  There is  a process in place for adding disclaimers to work produced under grants and   awards, and papers  written and speeches given by Census Bureau employees, which do not fall under section 515 information    quality guidelines as long as the documents are not disseminated by the Census Bureau.   These information quality  guidelines do not apply to press releases, fact sheets, press conferences or similar    communications in any medium that announce, support the announcement or give public notice of information the    Census Bureau has disseminated elsewhere.  These guidelines do not cover archival information disseminated by the Census Bureau   before October 1, 2002, and still maintained by the Census Bureau as archival material.  Nor do these guidelines cover    information limited to adjudicative processes, such as pleadings, including information developed during the conduct of    any criminal or civil action or administrative enforcement action, investigation or audit against specific parties, or    information distributed in documents limited to administrative action determining the rights and liabilities of specific    parties under applicable statutes and regulations.  Third-party information, such as from states and local governments, may   be included in information that the Census Bureau disseminates.     Although third-party sources may not be directly subject to Section 515, information from such sources, when used by the    Census Bureau to develop information products, must be of known quality and consistent with the Census Bureau's information quality guidelines.     When such information is used, any limitations, assumptions, collection methods, or uncertainties concerning it are taken into account    and disclosed.         These guidelines cover information disseminated by the Census Bureau on or after October 1, 2002, regardless as to when the information   was first disseminated.  However, the pre-dissemination review procedures incorporated in the guidelines shall be applied only to    information first disseminated by the Census Bureau on or after October 1, 2002.  Disseminated information covered by these guidelines    shall comply with all applicable DOC and OMB Information Quality Guidelines.       In implementing these guidelines, the Census Bureau acknowledges that ensuring the quality of information is an important management    objective that takes its place alongside other Census Bureau objectives, such as ensuring the success of Census Bureau missions,    observing budget and resource priorities and restraints, and providing useful information to the public.  The Census Bureau intends    to implement these guidelines in a way that will achieve all these objectives in a harmonious way.       These guidelines use the definitions for ""quality,"" ""utility,"" ""objectivity,"" ""integrity,"" ""information,"" ""government information,""    ""dissemination,"" ""influential,"" and ""reproducibility"" found in the OMB Final Guidelines published in the  Federal Register , Vol.    67, No. 36, February 22, 2002.     These guidelines may be revised periodically, based on experience, evolving requirements at the Census Bureau, and concerns expressed by the public.          The Census Bureau maintains the quality of its data and information products by setting high   standards of performance in its activities.  These activities include:           The development of      concepts and methods;       The planning and design      of surveys and other means of collecting data;       The collection of data;       The processing and editing of        data;       The analysis of data;       The production of estimates or     projections;       The establishment of review procedures; and       The dissemination of data by      published reports, electronic files, and other media requested by users.                                Utility     The Census Bureau shall ensure that information disseminated to the public shall be useful to its intended users.    The requirements of utility are ongoing for a Federal statistical agency like the Census Bureau, which must be engaged in the continual    development of more useful data.        In establishing its priorities for statistical programs for the purpose of   providing objective information that is relevant to policy and   program needs, the Census Bureau works closely with the users of   information in the executive branch, the Congress, interested   nongovernmental people and groups, advisory committees, and the   sponsors of its reimbursable surveys, as well as conducting ongoing   surveys of data users and product reviews.  The demographic and   economic data and information the Census Bureau produces are critical to   understanding the health and well-being of the population, business and   industry. Our goals and programs reflect a commitment to respond to the   Nation's growing need for extensive, timely, and accurate data to   understand the increasing complexities of its population and its economy.        The data content requirements of some of our key programs, such as   the decennial census, are reviewed by OMB and by the Congress.  The   Constitution of the United States mandates the taking of the census every   ten years, and the decennial census is the foundation on which our   democratic system of government is built.  Title 13 of the United States   Code includes provisions about how the decennial census shall be taken,   and also grants authority for the economic censuses, which seek to   measure virtually all economic activity in the U.S.         The Census Bureau maintains ongoing contact with a broad spectrum   of users to ensure that its information continues to remain relevant.     Information collected by the Census Bureau is designed to provide measures that are relevant.    These measures are released to the public as official statistics.  Relevance is the     degree to which information products provide useful information for both current needs     and anticipated future needs.             The Census Bureau disseminates statistical information products to the public in a timely manner.     Timeliness encompasses frequency of data dissemination, as well as the closeness    of the release to the data's reference period.  Efforts are made to collect and publish data   in a time interval that allows high quality data to be disseminated to the public and also    ensures that the information is usable.        The Census Bureau disseminates statistical information products to the public    in a manner that allows them to be accessible to a broad range of data users with    different requirements for data availability and understandability.     Accessibility is the ease of access or effort needed for customers to acquire statistical data,    products, or services.  The Census Bureau conducts usability tests to ensure that its statistical    products are accessible and understandable to its data users.        The Census Bureau strives for ongoing improvements to meet our   customers' expectations for ease of access, quick turnaround times,   simple interface mechanisms, and comparability among different    data sources.   We also continually enhance the quality of our products   and services through greater functionality in data collection instruments as   we migrate to e-commerce and computer-assisted technologies.                                 Objectivity     The Census Bureau shall provide information that is accurate, reliable    and unbiased and shall ensure that its information products are presented in an accurate, clear,    complete and unbiased manner.  This objectivity is achieved by using reliable data sources and   sound analytical techniques and by using highly qualified people to prepare data products that are   carefully reviewed.        In the area of statistical information, objectivity also requires   acknowledging that errors in statistical estimates are unavoidable.  These   areas generally fall under the categories of ""sampling"" and ""nonsampling""   errors.  Sampling errors result when estimates are based on a sample and   not a complete canvass of the population of interest (as in a census).  The   Census Bureau provides information quantifying what is known about the   magnitude of these errors, such as variances or coefficients of variation to   quantify the magnitude of sampling errors.  Though quantifying   nonsampling errors is more difficult, the Census Bureau provides what   information it can on their magnitude.       The Census Bureau's commitment to quality and professional standards of   practice includes: the use of modern statistical theory and practice in all   technical work; the development of strong staff expertise in the disciplines   relevant to our mission; the implementation of ongoing quality assurance   programs to improve data validity and reliability, including improving the   processes of compiling, editing, and analyzing data; and the development   of a strong and continuing relationship with appropriate professional   organizations in the fields of statistics and relevant subject-matter areas.         Use of Reliable Data Sources         The Census Bureau bases its information products  on reliable,   accurate data that have been validated.      The Census Bureau assumes    responsibility for determining sources of data (including administrative records    and other data sources),  measurement methods, and methods of data collection and    processing for its censuses and surveys while minimizing respondent burden.  This    encompasses the development and determination of survey requirements and objectives,    precision desired, geographic scope, collection mode and respondent, the sampling frame,   sample design, estimation specifications, variance estimation specifications, and other    quality measurement specifications.        The Census Bureau builds measurement of quality, process control,   and performance into its data collection processes, thereby making   evident the quality and objectivity of its statistics.  The secure handling   of collected data will be assured by appropriate means throughout the   entire data collection process to preserve confidentiality and privacy.        The Census Bureau comprehensively documents all components of the   data collection process to assure the consistency of our processes.          Use of Sound Analytic Techniques             The Census Bureau uses sound analytical techniques to ensure   objectivity in our statistical information products.  The Census Bureau   assumes responsibility for determining and employing appropriate   methods of analysis.  We evaluate the techniques used to analyze data,   continually searching for more effective, accurate, and reliable analysis   tools.  We evaluate and report on the quality of our analyses.         The Census Bureau performs appropriate statistical tests, addressing   the characteristics of the sample design in official products, and   documents measures of sampling error.   Preliminary quality checking   and exploratory data analysis techniques are utilized to identify, where   possible, instances of nonsampling error, including missing data,   measurement error, processing error, and specification error.  Additional   quality checks are used to prevent errors in the analysis, including the data   used for the analysis; the computations; and the text, tables, and figures   used to report the analysis results.           Pre-Dissemination Review Required for the Release of Data                   All documents released by the Census Bureau undergo an extensive   review that encompasses the content, statistical and survey   methodology, and policy implications of the document.   The review ensures that   the data and text of the document meet Census Bureau standards for quality.  If a potential   data product is determined by the Census Bureau as unfit for use because it does not meet    Census Bureau requirements for quality, the Census Bureau reserves the right to withhold    the data product from dissemination to the public.         Informing Users of Data Quality and Methodology             The Census Bureau informs users of the concepts and methodologies   used in collecting and processing the data, the quality of the data it   produces, and other features of the data that may affect their use or   interpretation.   The availability of sound methodological practices and   the use of those methodologies are critical in ensuring the quality of the   statistics.  By providing information on methodology and concepts to data   users, the Census Bureau will enable users to make judgments and verify   that the data they are using are similar in conceptual framework and   definitions to the data they need to complete their work.  It also allows   users to more accurately assess the errors which restrict their use of the   data.  Specifically:        Statistical products are accompanied by descriptions of, or references to    descriptions of, the methods and procedures used in their development, and    other information about the data that may affect its use.         The documentation provided to users conveys useful information on   data quality, and engenders an awareness of quality as an issue in the   proper use of the data.         The Census Bureau provides indicators of the quality of the statistical    information it disseminates to the public, along with definitions and descriptions    of the concepts and methods.         The information on methodology provided or referenced permits the user to    determine whether the data adequately approximate what they wish to measure, and    whether the estimates they wish to use were produced with tolerances acceptable for    their intended purpose.         The level of information provided in documentation on data quality or   methodology depends on the type of data collection, data sources, and   analysis; confidentiality protection required by statute; the medium of   dissemination; the range and impact of uses of the data; and the total   budget of the statistical program.                  Policy for correcting errors            In accordance with the OMB guidelines, the Census Bureau has   established mechanisms providing the public with the opportunity to seek   correction of information disseminated by the organization that does not   comply with our information quality guidelines.   Corrective actions will   vary. Possibilities include immediate correction or replacement of information on the   Census Bureau website ( http://www.census.gov ), revision of   subsequent issues of recurring products, and issuance of errata for   printed reports and other data products.   Written or electronic requests   for correction communicated to the Census Bureau should specifically   identify the information or procedures of concern, explain why the information is not   in compliance with the information quality guidelines, indicate any potential adverse impact, and   provide a return address for our response.  If we agree that an error was   made, we will determine if the data will be corrected.  These guidelines   are not intended to imply any rights of individuals to request amendment   of their own records beyond those permitted by the Privacy Act of 1974 or   other organization specific laws .    Click here to access the complete   correction request procedure .                                 Integrity     Information disseminated by the Census Bureau to the public, independent of the    specific distribution mechanism, shall be safeguarded from improper access, modification,   or destruction.  The Census Bureau will ensure that disseminated information, including    original and supporting information, is protected commensurate with the risk and magnitude    of harm that could result from the loss, misuse or unauthorized access to or modification    of such information.       All electronic information disseminated to the public by the Census Bureau adheres to the    standards set out in Appendix I, ""Security of Federal Automated Information Resources""; OMB   Circular A-130; the Computer Security Act; and the Government Information Systems Reform Act.       Confidentiality of data collected by every agency within the Department of Commerce is    safeguarded under legislation including the Privacy Act and titles 13, 15, and 22 of the    U.S. Code.  For any formal statistical data releases to the public, the Census Bureau    maintains strict procedures to protect premature disclosure of the data before the publicly    scheduled date and time of the release.                 Transparency and Reproducibility                                In adopting Information Quality performance standards for objectivity, the Census Bureau    will continue its long-standing practice of making our statistical information as transparent   as possible.  Census Bureau quality guidelines require that our statistical products be    accompanied by descriptions of or references to descriptions of the methods and procedures used    in their development and other information about the data that may affect its use.  The Census    Bureau provides indicators of the quality of the statistical information it disseminates to the    public, along with definitions and descriptions of the concepts  and methods. The information on    methodology provided or referenced permits the user to determine whether the data adequately    approximate what they wish to measure, and whether the estimates they wish to use were produced    with tolerances acceptable for their intended purpose. While the Census Bureau utilizes internal    peer review to ensure quality in content and subject matter as well as in the application of    statistical methodology, and external peer review in content development for many of our programs,    and for the review of results in our most highly critical activities, it fully meets    OMB section 515    requirements of objectivity in analytic results by ensuring disclosure of the specific quantitative    methods and assumptions that have been employed, and the disclosure of error sources affecting    data quality.       Statistical information products disseminated to the public by the Census Bureau must be reproducible    following prescribed methodology.  Reproducibility means that there is the capability to use the    documented methods on the same data set to achieve a consistent result.  Documentation provided by    the Census Bureau must allow results to be repeated.  However, data released by the Census Bureau    generally will not be directly reproducible by the public because the underlying data sets used to    produce them are confidential.  In such cases, our documented methods can be reviewed by users in    lieu of an actual recreation of the results. In addition, some results may not be easily reproduced    by third parties due to the complexity and detail of the methods and data.  In these cases, greater    emphasis is placed on periodic review by outside panels of technical experts, and we apply especially    rigorous robustness checks, as described in our Performance Principles for Census Bureau activities (below).        Some statistical information is not available to the public because of its sensitive and proprietary    nature, or because it is unfit for use.  For example, while the original and supporting data the    Census Bureau collects and develops to generate its statistical information products are covered by    the same quality guidelines and statistical standards as the information it disseminates, the original   and supporting data are proprietary and confidential and not subject to reproducibility requirements.     Additionally, if a potential data product is determined by the Census Bureau as unfit for use because    it does not meet Census Bureau requirements for quality, the Census Bureau reserves the right to withhold    the data product from dissemination to the public.  Whether statistical information products are fit for    use depends on the intended uses and on their fundamental characteristics of quality as defined in the    Census Bureau's quality principles and quality standards, as well as on the expectations of users for    what is acceptable for these characteristics of quality.  The range of quality characteristics    underlying fitness for use includes relevance, accuracy, timeliness, interpretability, and coherence.         Finally, we also achieve transparency through the wide dissemination of our   information.   Many reports and other data products are available both as printed and   electronic documents.  They are announced on the Census Bureau web site and most   electronic versions can be accessed and downloaded directly from the site.  The Census   Bureau is committed to making every document on its internet server accessible to all.    Currently, we are reviewing our site and making modifications to those pages which are   not in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.                                        Performance Priniciples for Census Bureau Activities            The development of      concepts and methods;       The planning and design      of surveys and other means of collecting data;       The collection of data;       The processing and editing of        data;       The analysis of data;       The production of estimates or     projections;       The establishment of review procedures; and       The dissemination of data by      published reports, electronic files, and other media requested by users.

This is what ALA's Intellectual   Freedom Office was so thrilled with, especially section 9.   ********   PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES   USE OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS   EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000   The following procedures are designed to facilitate the equitable   distribution of electronic resources at all Alachua County Library   District locations.   1. Computer workstations are designed for use by one person. Exceptions   may be made by library staff.   2. Patrons are allowed to download from the Internet to a disk only.   Patrons must provide their own disk.   3. Patrons' personal software or hardware may not be used or installed on   library equipment.   4. Printing from Internet Workstations is available at a nominal cost to   the patron. There is no limit to the number of pages a patron can print.   5. All copyright laws apply to the Internet workstations. Refer patrons   with questions to the posted signs at the print release stations and   provide copies at the service desk for patron review.   6. Because workstations are located in public areas, what is viewed is not   private. Under Florida Statute Chapters 847.011(1) and 847.0133(1), the   display of obscene materials to minors, viewing child pornography and the   printing of such materials is illegal and punishable. Staff who observe or   have patrons report these situations should contact their Department   Manager or person-in-charge. Document the incident with a Problem Behavior   Report.   7. All standard Internet Workstations are equipped with privacy screens.   Staff should remove a privacy screen only upon a patron request. All   workstations are set to ""time out"" after a set period of no activity.   8. Patron comments about Internet service or content should be handled   through discussion as any other complaint or concern. If patrons wish to   formally comment on Internet content, staff should give them a ""Patron   Comment on Materials"" form to complete. The completed form will be   forwarded to the Automated Services Coordinator within one working day of   its receipt by library staff. The Automated Services coordinator will   appoint a staff committee to review the challenged internet content in   light of the INTERNET ACCESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMER. This committee will   then formulate a written recommendation, responding to the patron comment   and will forward this recommendation to the Library Director within four   (4) weeks of the committee appointment. (This process is similar to the   one in place for comments on print and audio-visual materials.)   Within one week of receiving the committee's recommendation, the Library   Director will prepare a final written response to the patron. This   response will be forwarded to the patron and to the Board of Trustees.   Comments relating to adding or deleting websites from a filtered   workstation will be reviewed and the committee will forward the request to   the Library Director who will forward the request to FIRN, if appropriate,   and will respond to the patron. At any time, patrons will be able to   communicate directly with FIRN from our screens, if they wish to do so.   9. On all Internet workstations, patrons will be able to choose, from a   menu, filtered or unfiltered access to the Internet. Library staff will   not monitor, control or restrict anyone's access to the range of   information available within the limits of State and/or Federal law.   Parents or designated guardians, who wish to limit or restrict the access   of their own children, should personally oversee their use of the Internet   and other forms of electronic information. Children who visit the library   without a parent or guardian will be responsible for their own decisions   and behaviors.   10. When necessary, to facilitate access to high-demand resources, staff   in-charge can change the designated login on a workstation.   11. Internet users will have access to Web-based and AFN e-mail, chat and   games within the limits of State/Federal law. The Library District does   not provide e-mail accounts for users but simply provides access to   patrons' existing e-mail accounts   *********   And here's our SIGNUP PROCEDURE:   *********   PROCEDURE: FILE: ACLD GENERAL PROCEDURES   SIGN-UP OF PUBLIC INTERNET WORKSTATIONS   EFFECTIVE: April 27, 2000   To ensure equitable access to Internet Workstations for all library users,   Branch or Department Managers may deem it necessary to sign-up patrons for   Internet use during peak hours. When sign-up is used, all library   facilities will adhere to the following guidelines.   1. Patrons must schedule a session for the Internet workstations at the   public service desk, using existing sign-up sheets supplied by HQPS.   2. A scheduled session is at least a 30 minute block of time. Sessions are   scheduled on the half-hour or hour. Each Branch Manager shall establish a   consistent timetable of half hour and/or hourly sessions. Timetables   should be compatible with traffic patterns in the library.   For example:   Timetable A: indicates a peak traffic pattern 2pm-closing Monday - Friday   and weekends.   10 am -2 pm Monday-Friday sessions are 1 hour.   2 pm-closing Monday-Friday sessions are 30 minutes   Saturday-Sunday sessions are 30 minutes   Timetable B: indicates peak traffic pattern all open library hours.   30 minute sessions all open library hours   Timetable C: indicates ample available equipment during all open library   hours including peak.   1 hour sessions all open library hours   3. Patrons may sign up for the next available session at the end of their   1st session.   4. Scheduled sessions are limited to 2 per person per day.   5. Reservations can be taken, either in-person or on the phone, for same   day or next library business day.   6. If a patron does not arrive within 5 minutes after the session is   scheduled to begin, library staff can offer it to another patron.   7. Internet Workstations are available during the hours the library is   open. In order to facilitate printing, finishing documents, etc. at   closing time, the last scheduled session will be one hour before closing.   ***********   The thing that makes this work is a series of screens designed by our   staff where the user has to FIRST, agree to accept our internet policy,   and SECOND, choose either filtered or unfiltered use. If you don't   accept, OR don't choose to filter or not, you can't get to the Internet.   This solution was thought up by a committee of our staff and we all   thought it was brilliant. We still do...but of course we still get   complaints! -ch   Carol Hole   Alachua County Library   Gainesville, FL     chole@exchange.acld.lib.fl.us                 Last updated:  07/17/2003         by Theresa C.

GX232-40-3694918	"INTERNET ACCESS POLICY I. PURPOSE. The Internet, as an information resource, enables the Library to provide access to a vast array of law- related information, ideas, commentary, and research tools beyond the confines of its own collection. The Law Library believes that the Internet's vast resources should be broadly available. However, all users of electronic information resources such as the Internet are also e xpected to use these resources in a responsible manner, consistent with the law- related educational and informational purposes for which the Law Library provides access, and subject to the following guidelines. II. DISCLAIMER. A. The Library does not vouch for the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of information obtained through the Internet. Verifying the accuracy of information is the responsibility of the originator or producer, and assessing accuracy and timeliness of information is the responsibility of the user. B. Internet resources may contain material of a controversial nature. Selection policies governing the Library's acquisition of library materials are not applicable to general Internet access. The Library does not endorse any viewpoints represented on the Internet, but does not attempt to control access to or content of materials available on the Internet, and can not protect users from offensive information. C. The Library currently accesses the Internet through Maricopa County's proxy server. The County has decided to prevent access to certain sites. The Library does not necessarily endorse the use of a proxy server, and has not been involved in determining which sites may or may not be accessed. If you have any problems or concerns about t he limitations imposed by proxy server access, or if you are denied access to a site you believe is of research value, please contact the Library's reference staff. D. Library system menus may identify specific resources and starting points for research. However, the Library can not control Internet access points, which can change rapidly and unpredictably. E. The Library assumes no responsibility for any damages, direct or indirect, arising from use of its computer and network facilities, or from provision of access to Internet services. III.

F. In a manner that disrupts or interferes with other Library computer users. This includes, but is not limited to: harassment of others, and displaying or printing text or graphics that may reasonably be construed as offensive to others. G. Use of Library system resources to falsely represent yourself or the Library. IV. LIMITATIONS ON USE.

A. The Library reserves the right to regularly delete files from computer and network disk drives. B. The Library reserves the right to impose time limitations on the use of Library computers. C.

Permanent barriers to creating                      noninfringing copies goes far beyond the constitutional copyright                      protection that protects works ""by securing for limited                      times"".

A large number of digital media works are released                        with extra material not available in analog format. Therefore,                        following the Register's own logic, it is reasonable to                        create an exemption to allow users to access these works                        if the use is legitimate and lawful.

The                        problem is: 1) Criminals are implementing copyrighted technology                        that controls access to works which may be considered protected                        under the DMCA (i.e., the tool used is copyrighted and the                        work protected is copyrighted), 2) Government agencies often                        lack the ability to create tools capable of circumventing                        copyrighted works protected by copyrighted technological                        measures; therefore relying on the private sector to make                        tools available. The DMCA does not make exceptions when                        1) the copyrighted tool used to protect access was used                        for criminal activity, 2) the protected work involves criminal                        activity, or 3) the trafficking of circumventing tools when                        designed for use in situations where there are exemptions                        such as the need to access protected works in the course                        of an investigation.                                                                                                                                                              Comment                                           comment                      text  (2 pages)                                                                                                                                                                        8                                                                 Anthony                        Burokas                                                                                Class                                            All Classes:                      literary works; musical works; dramatic works; pantomimes                      and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural                      works; motion pictures and other audiovisual works; sound                      recordings; and architectural works.                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary                                            We                          need to ensure an individual's access to works they create                          or purchase.                         First: Current encription and digital watermarking prohibit                          an individual from making as many digital copies of their                          own created muscal works as they want. I record my music                          on Minidisk. I digitally copy it to a CD Recorder. I then                          try to make dupes of that master CD in the CD recorder                          but this is impossible. I am disallowed access to my own                          music through the implimentation of SCMS ""bits""                          that mark one an original, another a copy and prohibit                          any copies of copies. If I lose my original, I cannot                          access my music for any digital duplication because of                          the hardware restrictions that already exist in the market.                         Secondly, when I purchase musical works or motiopn pictures                          (for example), I fully expect to be able to access that                          music on any and all means available to me. However, current                          CD ""protection"" schemes actually inhibit the                          playback of said CDs on my Macintosh. The simply do not                          work, and caused the computer to be unable to eject the                          CD. Another example: I purchase a DVD for home enjoyment,                          but do not have a DVD for the children to watch in the                          car. I would like to make a VHS copy of the DVD but copy                          protection means I, and my children, cannot access the                          movie in the car. I am forced to purchase the motion picture                          twice. Another consideration: For convenience I prefer                          a single CD of 150 MP3 songs (that I legally own) to having                          to bring along 10-15 different CD's with 10-15 songs each                          and change them every hour in the car. I don't want to                          deal with CD cases, swapping disks and all that while                          on the road. It is safer and more convenient for me to                          access my music on one MP3 CD I create of my own music.                          I paid for the right to access my media, I should be allowed                          to access it where, and how, I see fit.

Motion pictures stored on DVDs are usually encrypted.                          2. Encryption of motion picture on a DVD prevents fair                          uses of the motion picture.                          3. Fair uses of a copyrighted work are legal, so circumvention                          of encrpytion for these purposes should be exempt.

While ""Trading""                          (Stealing) or sale of physical reproductions of such works                          should clearly be illegal, the current regulations, which                          consist of a blanket ban against the breaking of digital                          copy protection methods inhibit fair use of products legally                          purchased in the following ways.                         1) Copy protection methods currently in force can prevent                          the legal playing of protected works in most computer's                          sound systems, and occasionally in Auto CD players, and                          even more rarely in some makes and models of dedicated                          Home CD players.                         2) Current regulations make illegal any methods of compressing                          such copy protected files for otherwise legal listening                          on commercially available ""MP3 Players"" (much                          like a ""walkman"", or Automobile sound system                          MP3 decks.) Such compression allows the user to carry                          with them a much larger number of songs than would be                          practicable in the native cd format.                         3) Current rules are the logical equivalent of executing                          all of the residents of a town to make sure you get the                          one serial killer among them. This alone classifies the                          current regulations as ""Not in the public interest""                         4) Copying digital media for legal, ""Fair Use"",                          purposes is not an exercise in ""Interstate Commerce""                          and is therefore not subject to Federal Regulation.                         I would add, as an aside, that I am both a musician and                          a professional software publisher. As such I most certainly                          do not approve of the pirating of Copyrighted materials.                          None the less, preserving the legal concept of ""Fair                          Use"" is beneficial not only to the end users of such                          products, but to the producers of those products as well.

The DCMA can be interpreted as making the publishing of                          information related to security flaws that if exploited                          would lead to circumventing some protection mechanism                          illegal. This is not consistant with the first amendment,                          nor is it consistant with common sense - we need the flaws                          to be identified so they can be fixed, particularly when                          they relate to the protection of computer systems from                          malicious exploitation. Therefore, it is important to                          exempt and exclude these text documents. An executable                          computer program whose purpose is the circumvention of                          a protection measure would not be included in the class,                          but a description of how such a program could be written                          would be included.

Circumvention                          of access controls for Public Domain works can not be                          a violation of 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(C) since that section                          refers only to copyrighted works.                         2.Commercially distributed software that is distributed                          with the intention of gathering information on users surreptitiously                          without their knowledge or consent is called ""Spyware""                          by computer security specialists. While obstensively the                          Spyware program is distributed to perform one function,                          it is actually a Trojan Horse collecting information about                          the user of the software without their knowledge and relaying                          it back to the distributer of the software. It uses the                          same technology and means of distribution as computer                          viruses. The only difference is that Spyware is less malicious                          than many computer viruses which may collect passwords                          and credit card numbers to commit fraud. Computer viruses                          may use encryption to change their appearance and hide                          their true operations. Spyware also uses encryption to                          hide the information collected, transmitted, or to prevent                          reverse engineering of the code to determine just what                          it truly is doing. Since Spyware is a computer program                          it is also a copyrighted work that may also claim to be                          using encryption to control access to its workings or                          as a part of a copy protection ""technology.""                          The prohibition on circumvention affects the ability of                          computer security specialists to determine what is or                          is not Spyware and what information has been compromised.

Non infringing use prevented - evaluation of the security                          of software packages. In particular, security audits assessing                          the likelihood that unauthorized users can utilize installed                          software to illegally hijack the resources of the computer                          system in which this software is installed.                         How this circumvents the encryption - the testing process                          unencrypts portions of the binary translation by describing                          any potentially dangerous and/or subversive behaviors                          the software possesses that may pose a threat to system                          integrity.                         Why this is otherwise protected - ""Clean room""                          implementations of software (precise descriptions of software                          behavior which exactly duplicate the behavior of another                          system created without access to the original software's                          unencrypted content) are protected under fair use (IBM                          lawsuit to prevent i386 clones). In addition, the quoting                          of portions of content for reporting purposes is explicitly                          permitted under fair use doctrine.                         Harm 1- Encourages non-US security researchers to explicitly                          prevent US citizens from accessing their work. (See RedHat                          advisory board for RHLinux for details of one such example                          (1)) This is done to protect researchers in countries                          that do not accept the validity of the DMCA within their                          borders from potential lawsuits in the US. This places                          US system administrators at a disadvantage against potential                          attackers since they are denied access to descriptions                          of how attackers can hijack their systems resources (preventing                          the deployment of countermeasures) while criminal attackers                          have full access.                         Harm 2- Discourages prompt reporting of system flaws                          to system administrators. Since those reporting flaws                          can experience (and have been threatened with) legal retaliation                          by software manufacturers, there is a significant disincentive                          to provide the information necessary to enact effective                          countermeasures. These information disclosures are typically                          unpaid. When a significant potential financial burden                          is attached, the rewards of providing the needed information                          are dwarfed by potential liabilities.                         Harm 3- Encourages complacency by software providers.                          Prior the DMCA's circumvention provision, companies with                          defective software were compelled by bad publicity to                          release well-tested patches quickly. Evidence provided                          below indicates that at least some companies are abusing                          the DMCA’s anti-circumvention clause to prevent                          their customers from discovering their vulnerability to                          criminals by threatening legal action against those individuals                          who publish this information(2).                         Harm 4- Recent reports from the Bush administration have                          reaffirmed the role rank and file system administrators                          have in securing the nations internet infrastructure against                          assault by terrorist organizations and rouge states. The                          DMCA's circumvention clause in relation to source code                          provides a significant hindrance to protection of the                          internet from hostile attack. System administrators are                          not only highly decentralized, but are scattered throughout                          a wide range of private and public enterprises. Effectively                          disseminating the information necessary to predict and                          prevent large scale assaults on the infrastructure are                          only possible if the information needed to prevent these                          assaults is protected against legal retaliation. Evidence                          that this threat is real is provided by the recent large-scale                          assaults against the DNS root servers in the past month                          (3).                                                  Specific examples cited in this work-                         (1)Descriptions of vulnerabilities discovered in software                          packages utilized in the Red Hat Linux operating system                          are published by foreign researchers in a fashion that                          bars US citizens from accessing this information. The                          researchers explicitly state that their decision to ban                          access by US citizens was motivated by fears of legal                          retaliation in the US under the DMCA’s anti-circumvention                          clause.                         (2)On July 19, 2002 HP sends legal notice to Adriel T.                          Desautels of Secure Network Operations, Inc. that they                          intend to prosecute under the DMCA’s circumvention                          clause unless they make every possible effort to retract                          publication of the security flaws in HP’s True64                          Unix operating System – full text of this letter                          provided below.                         (3)Sophisticated attack against dns root servers - Recently,                          a massive denial of service attack was launched against                          the 'root dns' servers - those computers that provide                          the means to translate word based internet addresses into                          raw IP addresses. The attack was both of exceptionally                          sophisticated and conducted in a manner suggesting of                          a test. The system was attacked for a brief time, then                          the attack was stopped by the attacker before the underlying                          structure of the internet could be significantly degraded.                          Both the unusually high degree of sophistication in the                          attack and the exploratory nature of the attack lend credibility                          to the threat of a future sophisitcated large scale assault                          against critical internet resources on which the economy                          is now dependant.

Example: E-books                        CLASS 2: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that tether the recording to a specific device or platform,                          thereby preventing a lawful possessor from using the work                          on an unsupported system in a non-infringing way.                          Example: Access-Restricted CDs                         CLASS 3: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that tether the work to                          a specific device or platform, thereby preventing a lawful                          possessor from using the work on an unsupported system                          in a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                         CLASS 4: Literary works restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention allows a lawful possessor to                          use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: E-books                         CLASS 5: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention of the technology allows a lawful                          possessor to use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: Copy-restricted CDs                         CLASS 6: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that limit access to and                          post-sale uses of the work, where circumvention of the                          technology allows a lawful possessor to use the work in                          a non-infringing way.

Example: E-books                         Summary:                           When a publisher distributes an E-book tethered to a specific                          device or platform, the DMCA prevents purchasers from                          reading content they lawfully acquire on the devices of                          their choosing. An exemption for this class of works would                          allow purchasers of E-books to lawfully circumvent access                          controls for the lawful purpose of reading a literary                          work on multiple devices or platforms.                          Facts:                          Literary works distributed in electronic format, often                          called E-books, are increasingly restricted by technological                          access controls that prevent owners from reading the book                          on the system they choose. For example, some Adobe E-books                          employ access control measures that prevent users from                          reading an E-book on any machine other than the one it                          was first downloaded onto. This is a problem for E-book                          purchasers who upgrade their computers or switch operating                          systems and are unable to read the E-books they had lawfully                          purchased on their new machine. It is also a problem for                          E-book purchasers who choose to read their E-books on                          a different computer or device, such as a laptop or PDA,                          from the one onto which it was originally downloaded.                         Argument:                          There is a legitimate need for purchasers to be able to                          move their E-books from a desktop to a laptop, from an                          IBM to a Macintosh, or from a Tablet to a PDA. Consumers                          have long exercised the option to read books on planes                          and on trains and in their backyard and in bed. Copyright                          law has never been construed to allow authors to prevent                          a reader's freedom to read a lawfully purchased literary                          work where and how they choose. No less opportunity should                          be available because the reader purchases an electronic                          book. E-books that employ technological restrictions that                          deny someone in lawful possession from accessing it where                          and how and on which device they choose allow content                          creators much greater ability to control reader's choices                          than they have ever had under copyright law.                          Furthermore, tethering literary works to a specific device                          limits an E-book owner's ability to exercise the full                          bundle of property rights long associated with ownership                          of a book. For example, the First Sale doctrine allows                          a reader to resell a book after she has finished it. Access                          controls that restrict the platforms on which an E-book                          can be read interfere with that right. If an E-book is                          tethered to a platform that becomes obsolete, the owner                          can no longer exercise her option to resell or otherwise                          dispose of the Ebook according to her choosing. Since                          the First Sale Privilege is a limitation on a copyright                          holder's ability to control distribution of that work,                          circumvention should be permitted on technological control                          measures that restrict redistribution of an E-book by                          tethering it to a particular device or system.                          Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          E-books to specific devices or platforms is necessary                          to allow purchasers to read and resell literary works                          with the same ease and versatility that they have historically                          exercised. By preventing circumvention of this class of                          access controls, the DMCA both denies purchasers of literary                          works the rights they retained under copyright's historic                          balance and endows creators with new rights to restrict                          how literary works are used in a manner never before contemplated                          or permitted. We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption                          to the DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access                          control measures that tether literary works to specific                          platforms or devices.                         -------------------                         CLASS 2: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that tether the recording to a specific device or platform,                          thereby preventing a lawful possessor from using the work                          on an unsupported system in a non-infringing way.                          Example: Access-Restricted CDs                         Summary:                          The DMCA prevents CD purchasers from listening to recordings                          they lawfully acquire on the devices of their choosing,                          when copyright holders distribute CDs that are tied to                          a specific device or platform. An exemption for this class                          of works would allow purchasers of CDs to lawfully circumvent                          access controls for the lawful purpose of listening to                          their recordings on multiple devices or platforms.                                                Facts:                          Compact Discs (CDs), music downloaded from the Internet,                          and other types of sound recordings are increasingly restricted                          by technological access controls that prevent owners from                          listening to their own recordings on the system they choose.                          For example, some distributors tether sound recordings                          to CD players, preventing lawful possessors from listening                          to the music on a computer (See: ""IBM Updates Copy-Protection                          Software"" by Tom Spring, CNN, April 10, 2002, at                          http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/ptech/ 04/10/copyright.software.idg/index.html,                          describing how the latest CD release by pop star Celine                          Dion employed access controls that prevented playback                          on a personal computer, and ""Sony: Downbeat For a                          New Online Music Battle"" by Laura Rohde, CNN, Sept.                          27, 2001 at http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/industry/09/27/sony.music.battle.idg/index.html,                          describing how Sony Music employed access controls to                          certain Michael Jackson CDs that prevented playback on                          computers and CD-ROMs). Other distributors tether sound                          recordings downloaded from the Internet onto the device                          they are originally downloaded (See: ""Music So Nice,                          You Pay Twice"" by Brad King, Wired News, Feb. 4,                          2002 at http://www.wired.com/news/mp3/0,1285,49188,00.html                          describing how Universal Music Group employed access control                          measures on the downloadable recording of ""Fast &                          Furious -- More Music"").                       Argument:                          There are many reasons why consumers want to be able to                          move their sound recordings from their computer to CD                          player, from their CD player to their Diamond Rio, or                          just from their living room to their car. Some users want                          to download music onto a portable MP3 player to listen                          to it while jogging. Others want the ability to wirelessly                          ""beam"" music from one device to another for                          easier or continued use. There is also a cultural heritage                          of making mix-tapes for one's girlfriend, or to listen                          to on road trips. Today, digital technology enables people                          to access their music collection in unprecedented new                          ways. Transportability is one of the chief consumer benefits                          of digital technology, giving consumers the ability to                          ""space-shift"" or ""place-shift"" their                          music from one physical location to another. This versatility                          and portability has historically been part of the rights                          of ownership of a sound recording and copyright law has                          always been construed to empower users to 'rip, mix, burn,                          and create'. Content owners have never been allowed to                          control where and how and in what order a user listens                          to her lawfully owned music. The DMCA changed that by                          preventing circumvention of access control measures that                          tether works to specific devices. To return copyright                          law's traditional balance between creator and users, listeners                          should be permitted to circumvent access controls that                          restrict lawful listening to sound recordings on the users'                          chosen platforms.                         As further evidence of the desirability and support for                          such an exemption, many of these portability fact-patterns                          prevented by the DMCA had previously been found by courts                          to be protected uses. Adopting this class exemption would                          be in line with the many court decisions that have upheld                          space or time-shifting. Most recently, in RIAA v. Diamond                          Multimedia Systems, Inc., 180 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir.1999),                          a court held that ""space-shifting"" of sound                          recordings between different devices is considered a lawful                          personal use. Most famously, in Sony Corp. of America                          v. Universal City Studios, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), the US                          Supreme Court held that ""time- shifting"" an                          entire copyrighted television show using the VCR constituted                          fair use under the Copyright Act, and thus was a protected                          act.                         Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          CDs to specific devices or platforms is necessary to allow                          purchasers to listen to their music with the same ease                          and versatility that they have historically exercised.                          By preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of music the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with rights to restrict how sound recordings                          are used in a manner never before contemplated or permitted.                          We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the                          DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access                          control measures that tether sound recordings to specific                          platforms or devices.                         --------------------                         CLASS 3: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that tether the work to                          a specific device or platform, thereby preventing a lawful                          possessor from using the work on an unsupported system                          in a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                                                    Summary:                          The DMCA prevents DVD purchasers from watching motion                          pictures they lawfully acquire on the device of their                          choosing, when the movie studios distribute the DVD tethered                          to a specific device or platform. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of DVDs to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of watching                          their motion pictures on multiple devices or platforms.                                                    Facts:                          Motion pictures in Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) format                          are increasingly restricted by technological access controls                          that prevent owners from watching the movie on the platform                          they choose. For example, under the Hollywood movie studios'                          region coding system, consumers cannot play DVDs purchased                          in one region, such as Japan, India, or Europe on machines                          they purchased in another region, such as the United States.                          Also, DVDs can be tethered to a single platform, preventing                          users from playing the same DVD on a computer and a stand-                          alone DVD player, or on a Macintosh and an IBM. The DMCA                          prevents users from circumventing the technology tethering                          a DVD or DVD player to the region where it was purchased                          or tethering a DVD to a designated platform or device.                                                 Argument:                          There are many reasons why consumers may want to play                          DVDs purchased in one region on a device manufactured                          in another region. They could be planning time abroad,                          have been given a gift from an overseas relative, or have                          purchased a souvenir movie of a vacation spot. And there                          are equally as many reasons why consumers might want to                          watch a movie on multiple platforms. They could have different                          DVD player in different rooms of their house, wish to                          upgrade their technology, or want to play a favorite movie                          for their children on a computer on a long plane ride.                          Without a new specific exemption from the Librarian, the                          public will be prevented from accessing their DVDs on                          their own equipment in perfectly lawful and previously                          protected ways.                         The DMCA permitting movie studios to have total control                          over a DVD's use contrasts vividly with copyright's history                          of balancing the interests of publishers, creators, and                          users. First, copyright owners' use of tethering to enforce                          region coding conflicts with 17 U.S.C. Section 602(a),                          which states that consumers do not infringe a copyright                          owner's exclusive rights if they import single copies                          of copyrighted works for personal, noncommercial uses.                          Second, the alienability of copyrighted works is restricted                          because owners are limited in acquiring and disposing                          of works that are not playable on local devices or on                          current device models. Third, innovation is limited because                          movie studios have a de facto legal monopoly over who                          can build DVD players. This unprecedented new power permits                          Hollywood to enforce anti-competitive practices, such                          as requiring a substantial cash bond upfront to build                          a software DVD player, and anti-competitive license terms,                          which by their very conditions, do not permit open source                          software development of DVD playing software. Together                          with the monopoly on who can build DVD players, functionality                          and design restriction choices of major studios prevent                          many lawful uses of a motion picture.                         The practice of tethering DVDs allows copyright owners                          to legally enforce region coding and consequently, price                          discrimination. It also allows copyright owners to increase                          revenues by forcing consumers to purchase multiple copies                          of movies to play on their various platforms, devices                          and operating systems. This interferes with numerous non-infringing                          uses of motion pictures and other audiovisual works distributed                          in digital format. It is particularly troublesome as the                          copyright owners uses the DVD format as its sole means                          for delivering motion pictures to users. DVDs can only                          be accessed on devices or systems authorized and licensed                          by the copyright owners through its licensing entity DVD-CCA.                          This means that the copyright owners can control both                          who makes the devices and what kinds of devices and features                          are available for viewers to watch their lawfully purchased                          movies. By preventing users from circumventing access                          control measures on either DVDs or DVD players, the DMCA                          allows copyright owners an unprecedented amount of control                          over which devices enter the market, how much DVDs and                          players cost, what functions and features are forbidden                          to include on a DVD player, and where and how users watch                          their motion pictures.                                                This is most famously demonstrated by the continued lack                          of any device to watch movies on the Linux operating system.                          Besides stand-alone DVD players, computer software can                          also be written which allows for viewing a DVD on a personal                          computer. Despite Hollywood's years of promises and press                          releases, there is still no licensed DVD player for the                          Linux operating system available for consumer purchase                          (See: ""Corporate Paws Grab for Desktop"" by Brad                          King, Wired News, Sept. 9, 2002 at http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,54941,00.html).                          Because of the DMCA's restriction on circumventing access                          controls, users cannot circumvent the technology tethering                          movies to a Microsoft operating system in order to play                          those movies on a Linux operating system. And they cannot                          purchase content designed for a Linux machine, as the                          copyright owners do not market movies for that platform.                          Thus users of the Linux operating system are de facto                          prevented from viewing their legally obtained movies on                          their computers.                       Circumvention of access control measures that tether                          DVDs to specific devices or platforms is necessary to                          allow purchasers to watch motion pictures with the same                          ease and versatility that they have historically exercised.                          By preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of movies the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with new rights to restrict how movies are used                          in a manner never before contemplated or permitted. We                          urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the DMCA's                          general ban on circumvention of access control measures                          to permit owners to lawfully circumvent access control                          measures that tether motion pictures to specific platforms                          or devices.                         --------------------                          II. Dual Purpose Technology                         CLASS 4: Literary works restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention allows a lawful possessor to                          use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: E-books                         Summary:                          When a publisher distributes an E-book in a format where                          one technology limits access to and limits post-sale uses                          of the book, the DMCA's restriction on circumventing an                          access control technology prevents the user from circumventing                          the post-sale control technology. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of E-books to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of exercising                          the full bundle of their post-sale rights.                                                 Facts:                          Literary works distributed in electronic format, often                          called E-books, are increasingly restricted by technological                          controls that both prevent owners from accessing their                          book and limit owner's post-sale non-infringing use of                          their book. For example, Adobe's E-book access-restriction                          technology allows publishers to disable many post-sale                          lawful uses of the book, such as printing a single page,                          reading the text aloud, or 'space-shifting' an E-book                          to a hand-held device for more convenient reading. Since                          it is often the same technology that restricts access                          to an E-book that also restricts its post-sale use, the                          DMCA's ban on bypassing access controls allows E-book                          publishers to also control the consumer's use of the E-book                          by technology that cannot be lawfully circumvented (See:                          ""Digital Copyright Overkill"" by the Economist,                          Dec. 5, 2002 at http://www.economist.com/business/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1482259                          and ""Security Technologies Could Backfire Against                          Consumers"" by Robert Lemos, CNET News, Nov. 7, 2002                          at http://news.com.com/2009-1001-964628.html describing                          how dual-purpose technologies inhibit post-sale uses of                          literary works).                       Argument:                          Ebook readers have a legitimate need to be able to circumvent                          and disable certain post-sale access controls in order                          to exercise the traditional rights of book ownership.                          These post-sale access controls, colloquially termed Digital                          Rights Management Systems (DRMS), allow E-book publishers                          to prevent a wealth of fair uses, including the right                          to print, parody, space shift, sell, and trade the book.                          Together with the rights protected under the DMCA, DRMs                          give E-book publishers unprecedented control over an individual's                          reading experience. The traditional copyright balance                          has tipped dramatically against the consumer and must                          be corrected if readers are to retain their lawful rights                          to use books in the digital realm.                         The exemption is also necessary to satisfy Congress'                          intent in passing the law. In enacting the DMCA, Congress                          specifically intended to permit the circumvention of access                          controls where it was necessary for users to exercise                          fair uses. E-book publishers and technology companies                          are 'circumventing' Congress' clear intent by applying                          dual use technologies to E-books. By doing so, they prevent                          readers from bypassing any of the post-sale use restrictions                          lawfully, because to do so would also mean bypassing the                          access controls which is forbidden by the DMCA.                         Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to read, print, use and resell literary works with the                          same ease and versatility that they have historically                          exercised. By preventing circumvention of this class of                          access controls, the DMCA both denies purchasers of literary                          works the rights they retained under copyright's historic                          balance and endows creators with rights to restrict how                          literary works are used in a manner never before contemplated                          or permitted. We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption                          to the DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of the                          work, where the post sale use is protected under copyright                          law.                         -----------------                         CLASS 5: Sound recordings restricted by access controls                          that limit lawful access to and post-sale uses of the                          work, where circumvention of the technology allows a lawful                          possessor to use the work in a non-infringing way.                           Example: Copy-restricted CDs                         Summary:                          When a recording company distributes a sound recording                          in a format where one technology limits access to and                          limits post-sale uses of the recording, the DMCA's restriction                          on circumventing an access control technology prevents                          the user from circumventing the post-sale control technology.                          An exemption for this class of works would allow purchasers                          of CDs to lawfully circumvent access controls for the                          lawful purpose of exercising the full bundle of their                          post-sale rights.                          Facts:                          Compact Discs (CDs), music downloaded from the Internet,                          and other types of sound recordings are increasingly restricted                          by technological controls that both prevent owners from                          listening to their music and limit owners' post-sale use                          of their music. Growing numbers of copy-restricted CDs                          are distributed to the public treated with a technology                          that disable consumers ability to copy or otherwise use                          CDs in various lawful ways. If music CDs are only available                          in a restricted format, then individuals will not be able                          to engage in many lawful uses, including fair use of the                          work, whether for review and criticism or for personal,                          noncommercial copying. For example, users' ability to                          copy their music so that they can listen to it on other                          devices is being increasingly restricted by the release                          of CDs protected by access control technologies (See:                          'No more music CDs without copy protection', claims BMG                          Unit', John Lettice.

The Register, November 8, 2002 at http://theregister.co.uk/content/54/28009.hyml,                          describing the types of post-sale access controls that                          are being placed on CDs).                          Argument:                          The DMCA distinguishes between circumventing access controls                          and circumventing copy controls and allows circumvention                          of copy controls in order to engage in fair use. In passing                          the DMCA, Congress clearly intended the public to continue                          to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls on sound                          recordings for lawful purposes. While in theory, consumers                          continue to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls                          to make fair use or to engage in other lawful uses of                          sound recordings, the law still forbids bypassing access                          technology, and since its not possible to bypass copy                          controls without also bypassing access controls with dual                          use technologies, consumers are prevented from exercising                          the right to bypass the copy controls on sound recordings                          in order to make lawful use of their music.                          Copyright holders only have the right to control public                          performances of works under copyright law. But the private                          performance of a work -- the private experiencing of a                          work -- is intended to remain under the control of the                          individual. In total disregard to thiis clear limitation                          of rights, copyright owners are usurping the individual's                          private performance right through the use of technological                          access controls that ""double"" as use controls.                          Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to enjoy their sound recordings with the same ease and                          versatility that they have historically exercised. By                          preventing circumvention of this class of access controls,                          the DMCA both denies purchasers of music the rights they                          retained under copyright's historic balance and endows                          creators with rights to restrict how sound recordings                          are used in a manner never before contemplated or permitted.                          We urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the                          DMCA's general ban on circumvention of access control                          measures to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of the                          sound recordings, where the post sale use is protected                          under copyright law.                         ----------------                         CLASS 6: Motion pictures and other audiovisual works                          restricted by access controls that limit access to and                          post-sale uses of the work, where circumvention of the                          technology allows a lawful possessor to use the work in                          a non-infringing way.                           Example: DVDs                         Summary:                          When a movie studio distributes a movie in a format where                          one technology limits access to and limits post-sale uses                          of the audiovisual work, the DMCA's restriction on circumventing                          an access control technology prevents the user from circumventing                          the post-sale control technology. An exemption for this                          class of works would allow purchasers of movies to lawfully                          circumvent access controls for the lawful purpose of exercising                          the full bundle of their post-sale rights.                                                 Facts:                          Motion pictures distributed in Digital Versatile Disc                          (DVD) format are increasingly restricted by technological                          access controls that both prevent owners from accessing                          their movies and limit owners' post-sale uses of their                          movies. For example, many DVDs are distributed with an                          access control technology called the Content Scrambling                          System (CSS) that also controls post-sale use of the movie                          (See: ""'Tarzan' DVD forces viewers through a jungle                          of previews"" Greg Sandoval, CNET News March 2, 2000                          at                          http://news.search.com/click?sl,news.43.282.1278.0.1.%22                          fast+forward%22+dvds.0,http%3A%2F%2Fnews%2Ecom%2Ecom%2F2100%2D1017%2D237585%2Ehtml                          describing how Disney's ""Tarzan"" DVD prevents                          the consumers from fast-forwarding through the DVD's initial                          advertisements).                       Argument:                          The DMCA distinguishes between circumventing access controls                          and circumventing copy controls and permits circumvention                          of copy controls in order to engage in fair use. In passing                          the DMCA, Congress clearly intended the public to continue                          to enjoy the right to circumvent copy controls on motion                          pictures for lawful purposes. However, by exploiting the                          DMCA's ban on bypassing technological access controls,                          copyright owners are gaining greater control over the                          post-sale experience and use of a motion picture. This                          is beyond what copyright law grants or that the First                          Amendment permits. By using the same technology to regulate                          access to, and to regulate use of a DVD, the movie studios                          have created the de facto right to control private performances                          where a de jure right never existed.                         Furthermore, by refusing to license the creation of DVD                          players that permit copying or allow other lawful post-sale                          uses, copyright owners are using the DMCA to eliminate                          consumers' control over their own experience of audio-visual                          works. Without the ability to circumvent use controls,                          individuals are forced to experience motion pictures in                          a manner controlled by the movie industry. For example,                          parents who want to fast-forward through age-inappropriate                          movie-previews are prevented from that legitimate activity                          by CSS access controls and consumers are forced to watch                          advertisements, since bypassing the technology that prevents                          fast-forwarding during those ads would be a DMCA violation.                                                 Circumvention of dual use technologies that limit both                          access and post-sale use is necessary to allow purchasers                          to view movies with the same ease and versatility that                          they have historically exercised. By preventing circumvention                          of this class of access controls, the DMCA both denies                          purchasers of movies the rights they retained under copyright's                          historic balance and endows creators with rights to restrict                          how motion pictures and other audiovisual works are used                          in a manner never before contemplated or permitted. We                          urge the Librarian to recommend an exemption to the DMCA's                          general ban on circumvention of access control measures                          to permit owners to lawfully circumvent technological                          measures that limit both access and post-sale use of their                          movies, where the post sale use is protected under copyright                          law.

CSS prevents quotation of ancillary                          audiovisual works distributed on DVDs for purposes of                          commentary and criticism, which is a noninfringing use                          under current law. Consideration of the factors enumerated                          in § 1201(a)(1)(C) supports the conclusion that an                          exemption is warranted. An exemption will have no effect                          on the availability for use of copyrighted works: the                          vast number of ancillary audiovisual works are not available                          in unprotected formats; CSS access control on DVDs does                          not support a model beneficial to the public; and, availability                          of ancillary works on DVDs is driven by consumer demand                          and filmmaker enthusiasm. The effect on the availability                          for use of copyrighted works for nonprofit archival, preservation,                          and educational purposes is negative. The impact that                          the prohibition on the circumvention of technological                          measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism                          and comment is highly negative: fair use criticism and                          comment are a core concern of the First Amendment and                          must be granted special solicitude; the DMCA is a criminal                          statute and effects on free speech concerns must be scrutinized                          with particular care; ancillary materials are particularly                          important elements to quote for purposes of comment and                          criticism; the mere possibility of copying without violating                          § 1201(a)(1) is not sufficient to protect strong                          First Amendment rights; and, there is significant harm                          to an amateur reviews website and its contributors. The                          effect of circumvention of technological measures on the                          market for or value of copyrighted works is slightly positive,                          with no negative effects. In the alternative, the Librarian                          of Congress may determine that CSS is not an access control                          device because it does not control access to a work.

A slightly broader way to describe this class: copyrighted                        content for which the copyright holder consents to provide                        *open access*, when ""open access"" is defined as                        access permitting the unrestricted reading, downloading,                        copying, sharing, storing, printing, searching, linking,                        and crawling of some body of work.                         The most important works in this class are scientific                          and scholarly journal articles, at least when the copyright                          is retained by the author or transferred to an open-access                          journal. (When the author's copyright is transferred to                          a traditional journal, the new copyright holder will virtually                          never consent to open access, so we're not talking about                          that case.)                          Scientific and scholarly journal articles are in this                          class because scholarly authors are not paid for journal                          articles and do not expect payment. They are paid by their                          employers and share their research articles freely for                          the sake of advancing knowledge. They write for impact                          and not for money. When they retain copyright, or transfer                          it to an open-access journal, then the copyright holder                          will typically consent to open access. Access-blocking                          DRM would frustrate this intention.                          For the purpose of this rule-making, it shouldn't matter                          whether copyright-holder consent to open access is rare                          or frequent (hence, whether this class is small or large).                          In fact, the class is small but growing larger every day.                          The exemption is needed on the merits and in order to                          give this class a better chance of growing larger.                                                                                                                                                                                        Summary                                            The                          argument: When copyright holders consent to relinquish                          revenue, or consent to open access, then the copyright                          statute should not stand in their way. Copyright holders                          have a right to waive their rights, just as much as they                          have a right to enforce them. When authors sacrifice revenue                          in order to reach a larger audience, or in order to share                          and advance knowledge, then readers ought to get the benefit                          of the author's sacrifice. At the very least, access-blocking                          DRM will thwart, not serve, this class of copyright holders.                         For this class of works, an exceptionless anti-circumvention                          clause threatens readers with criminal penalties for gaining                          the kind of access that the copyright holder desires to                          make available. When authors consent to open access, then                          all use is non-infringing use. Preventing readers from                          taking advantage of this gift from authors not only frustrates                          copyright holders who wish to make this gift, but negates                          their sacrifice in relinquishing revenue, obstructs the                          free exchange of scientific ideas, and impedes research.                                                 For these reasons, most works in this class will be published                          in open-access archives or open-access journals, without                          DRM, and consequently circumvention will never be an issue.                          But the exemption is needed for the occasional works of                          this class for which user access is hindered by DRM barriers.                          Here are some examples:                         1. A scholar makes a point of publishing her research                          in an open-access journal. But several years later, the                          journal is sold to a publisher who changes the business                          model of the journal, and makes back issues accessible                          only to paying customers. The copyright holder's consent                          to provide open access has not changed.                         2. A scholar's work is published online by an open-access                          journal. But that journal is indexed by a search engine                          that also indexes many priced and access-restricted journals.                          Rather than discriminate and give free access to the free                          articles and priced access to the priced articles, it                          charges for full-text access to any article that comes                          up in response to a search.                         3. A government agency decides to outsource its publishing,                          bypassing the GPO and its open-access policies. The private-sector                          publisher makes the (public-domain) papers and other documents                          of the agency available only to paying customers.                          The general principle behind this request for an exemption                          was also asserted in a public statement by France's Académie                          des Sciences on December 6, 2001. The French Académie                          called on the European Commission not to apply ordinary                          copyright rules to scientific publications for which the                          authors seek no payment.                           http://www-mathdoc.ujf-grenoble.fr/DA/                          For more on open access, see the Budapest Open Access                          Initiative. (For example, the BOAI makes clear that many                          authors consenting to open access wish to retain copyright                          rather than put their works into the public domain.)                          http://www.soros.org/openaccess/                                                                                 Comment                                           comment                      text  (2 pages)                                                                                                                                                                        23                                             Don R.

To preserve these works, it is imperative that they                          be migrated to modern storage systems and that the reproductions                          be accessed to verify the accuracy and completeness of                          the transfer. This must be done before the formats or                          media become obsolete or damaged. This use is a non-infringing                          use protected by Sections 107, 108 and 117 of the Copyright                          Act. The proposed exemption is important to preserving                          the availability of the works and enabling archiving,                          future scholarship, and commentary. Furthermore, the proposed                          exemption is narrowly drawn and does not damage the market                          for the works. Without the ability to circumvent access                          controls in order to access archived reproductions, we                          have no way of ensuring this essential non-infringing                          use, and these works will vanish from the historical record                          of the 21st century.

We propose this exemption                        because currently deployed anti-copy technology does not                        support fair use of this class of works intended by Congress.

At present, much research                          of this type is impossible due to the prohibition on acts                          of circumvention in 1201(a)(1). The requested exemption                          would allow this research to proceed.                          The current state of the art in access control technology                          is due in large part to past research on those technologies.                          Yet today’s state of the art does not provide the                          desired level of protection for copyrighted content, so                          future research is needed. Without an exemption for legitimate                          research, much of the needed research will not occur.                          The requested exemption is not limited to encryption research                          but would cover all of the legitimate access control research                          that is being prevented by 1201(a)(1).                          My account of the harms caused by 1201(a)(1) – harms                          that would continue to accrue absent an exemption –                          is based in part on my direct personal experience in performing                          access control research prior to the effective date of                          1201(a)(1), and on my personal plans to resume such research                          should an exemption be granted. My account is also based                          on my general knowledge about my colleagues in the computer                          security research community, and my colleagues in other                          scholarly fields.                          I realize that the Librarian might conclude that it is                          impossible, within the confines of the NOI to grant an                          exemption for legitimate research. The Librarian might,                          for example, reach such a conclusion based on a determination                          that the NOI does not allow the Librarian to create an                          exemption that is narrowly tailored to enable legitimate                          research. If the Librarian does conclude that the NOI                          does not allow an exemption to protect legitimate research,                          I ask the Librarian to state that conclusion clearly,                          so that it is clear that any legitimate-research exception                          to 1201(a)(1) would require Congressional action.

The exemption would apply to “any lawfully                          acquired copy or phonorecord including a copyrighted work                          falling within any category in section 102 that, due to                          its nature and the users who typically use it, is likely                          to be lawfully used in particular environments under the                          fair use doctrine. The exemption shall apply only to such                          users in connection with such fair use” (e.g., the                          exemption would protect a university professor who circumvents                          a lock on a lawfully acquired e-book to use a short excerpt                          in a classroom setting, but would no longer protect the                          professor from suit under section 1201 if the professor                          then posts the (unlocked) e-book on the public Internet).                         3. “Per se Educational Thin Copyright Works”                          – Thin Copyright Works are works that contain limited                          copyrightable subject matter, and which derive significant                          value from material in the public domain, such as facts,                          processes, ideas, or other elements that are beyond the                          scope of copyright protection. To satisfy concerns of                          vagueness, the Copyright Office should recommend a specific                          list of types of works that are subject to the exemption,                          i.e., a “per se” list. The list proposed herein                          is focused on those works most often lawfully used in                          research and education. Thus, this class of exempt works                          consists of “particular subcategories within section                          102 and 103, namely databases, histories, statistical                          reports, abstracts, encyclopedias, dictionaries, and newspapers.”                         4. “Thin Copyright works” – This category                          consists of “works that contain limited copyrightable                          subject matter, and which derive significant value from                          material in the public domain, such as facts, processes,                          ideas, or other elements that are beyond the scope of                          copyright protection.”                         5. “Any work to which the user had lawful initial                          access (i) during the period of lawful access, or (ii)                          after any period of lawful access if the user has physical                          possession of a copy of the work.”                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          The works fall within a category set forth in section                          102, and thus fall within the 2002 NOI’s stated                          preference that section 102 constitute a “starting                          point” for the exempt class. “Per se”                          Educational Fair Use Works, due to their nature and the                          users who typically use them, are highly likely to be                          used in educational environments for fair use purposes                          such as teaching and scholarly research. Thus, application                          of TPMs that prevent access to such works will adversely                          affect the ability of users to engage in such fair use.                          If the Copyright Office is concerned about potential abuses                          of the exemption, a “user and environment”                          restriction could be placed on this “per se”                          list, as described in proposed exemption no. 2.                         2. Contrary to the Librarian’s determination as                          reflected in the 2000 Final Rule, the relevant section                          1201 “classes of works” may be defined with                          reference to the users of such works as well as the type                          of use to which such works are put. The statute, in defining                          the scope of the exemption, expressly references the “persons                          who are users” of the copyrighted work at issue,                          17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(B). Similarly, the statutory                          provision that provides for this rulemaking refers to                          the “users” who are adversely affected in                          their ability to make “noninfringing uses,”                          17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(C), and the provision that                          provides for publication of exempt classes of works refers                          to the “users” to whom the prohibition shall                          not apply. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1)(D).                           This proposed category of “Fair Use Works”                          does nothing more than permit users to engage in their                          legal right of fair use, unimpeded by access control technologies.                          As Congress expressed throughout the legislative history,                          the triennial rulemaking was specifically meant to permit                          such activity.                         3. Works in the above category most likely derive significant                          value from material in the public domain, such as pure                          facts, or other elements beyond the scope of copyright                          protection, such as ideas. Thus, the application of an                          effective TPM to such works would preclude users from                          obtaining access to elements of a work that are not protected                          by copyright law. While the Librarian noted in the 2000                          Final Rule that such works also include copyrightable                          elements, the use of such elements remain subject to copyright                          law remedies (e.g., infringement suits) notwithstanding                          the proposed exemption. Copyright owners should not be                          able to preclude the public from accessing non-protectible                          features of a “Thin Copyright” work. The scope                          of 1201 was not meant to extend beyond copyrightable features                          of a work, and it is well established that the raw facts                          and ideas in a work may be copied at will. See, e.g.,                          Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499                          U.S. 340, 348, 350 (1991).                         4. Because the “per se” list in exemption                          no. 3 could leave out significant categories of Thin Copyright                          works, this more flexible exemption also should be adopted.                          Although not necessary, a limitation as to the types of                          users (professors, staff, and students) and context of                          use (education and research) could be applied to this                          category.                         5. Congress intended to distinguish between access control                          and use control TPMs. The content community has made clear                          that it intends to use technologies that it classifies                          as “access control” to implement use control,                          effectively eliminating the distinction Congress intended                          to preserve. Recent multi-industry consortia concerned                          with protection of content on CDs (“Secure Digital                          Music Initiative” (SDMI)), DVDs (“DVDCCA Call                          for Proposals” on a watermarking technology), and                          digital broadcast television (“Broadcast Protection                          Discussion Grouop” (BPDG)) confirm the major content                          owners’ goals of end-to-end technological control                          over all uses of their content. The proposed exemption                          no. 5 prevents this result and preserves the rights of                          users to engage in lawful uses of lawfully acquired content.                          The scope of the exemption is appropriate, because the                          exemption does not apply after the initial, lawful access                          unless the user possesses a physical copy (in which case                          the user should be entitled to continue accessing the                          work, while his use thereof will be subject to copyright                          law and, in appropriate cases, license).

Those literary works, musical works and audiovisual works,                        for which a person has lawfully obtained a right of use,                        protected by access control mechanisms which include features,                        flaws or vulnerabilities that (a) expose (i) the works to                        be protected or (ii) other assets of the users of such measures--including                        computers, computers systems or computer networks or the                        data or other protected works used with them--to infringement,                        compromise, loss, destruction, fraud and other adverse actions                        or (b) permit the privacy of such users to be compromised.                         2. Those literary works representing computer software                          programs and databases, for which a person has lawfully                          obtained a right of use, that operate to control access                          to works protected under the Copyright Act but contain                          features, flaws or vulnerabilities that (a) expose (i)                          the works to be protected or (ii) other assets of the                          users of such measures--including computers, computers                          systems or computer networks or the data or other protected                          works used with them--to infringement, compromise, loss,                          destruction, fraud and other adverse actions or (b) permit                          the privacy of such users to be compromised.                          3. Compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked                          by filtering software applications.                         4. Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          Access control mechanisms that fail to provide adequate                          security to the works they are intended to protect are                          also likely to expose the authorized user of a computer,                          computer system, or network to damage or loss, including                          the loss of privacy. The presence of these flawed mechanisms                          exposes other protected works on related computers, computer                          systems, and networks, to unauthorized access. The requested                          exemption permits those with a lawful right of access                          to conduct additional research, scholarship and criticism                          regarding the adequacy of the control mechanisms, as well                          as protected works, within the scope of fair use. Prohibiting                          circumvention relating to the proposed exempt class of                          works is estimated to cost the American economy significant                          amounts per year (although precise cost estimates are,                          for a variety of reasons including underreporting of losses                          and the existence of indirect losses, !                          virtually impossible to ascertain) due to (a) unauthorized                          access through defective control mechanisms, (b) costs                          incurred by consumers and businesses to repair features,                          flaws or vulnerabilities in such control mechanisms and                          (c) lost revenues from users who avoid expenditures on                          protected works and related computer-based expenses out                          of concern for security and privacy risks associated with                          the related access controls. The proposed exemption will                          have no adverse impact upon the owners of the classes                          of works for which the exemption is requested.                         2. Computer software programs and databases that operate                          to control access to works protected under the Copyright                          Act can contain features, flaws or vulnerabilities that                          expose the computers, systems, networks and other assets                          of authorized users to damage or loss, including the loss                          of privacy. In furtherance of the exemptions relating                          to circumvention available under Section 1201(e), 1201(g)                          and 1201(j), the proposed exemption permits authorized                          users to vigorously research, test and verify the functionality                          of the class of works to which the proposed exemption                          relates, and to publish related results and criticisms                          regarding such works, within the scope of fair use. The                          costs of prohibiting circumvention of the proposed exempt                          class of works are enormous. The failure to be able to                          test, and subsequently remediate, security flaws in software                          and databases is estimated to cost the American economy                          significant dollar amounts per year due to (a) unauthorized                          access through de!                          fective control mechanisms, (b) costs incurred by consumers                          and businesses to repair features, flaws or vulnerabilities                          in such control mechanisms and (c) lost revenues from                          users who avoid expenditures on protected works and related                          computer-based expenses out of concern for security and                          privacy risks associated with the related access controls.                          These costs are matched by the continued risks of substantial                          harms not yet realized from future adverse events related                          to the inability to circumvent and test access controls                          protecting the class of work.                         3. The proposed exemption is fully supported by the rationale                          adopted by the Register in the initial exemption rulemaking                          under Section 1201(1)(a)(3). There have been no changes                          in the marketplace or in the related technologies or business                          practices that mitigate against the necessity for continuing                          the exemption.                         4.

Identification of Class 2:                          Sound recordings and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures) embodied in copies and phonorecords, protected                          by access control mechanisms which require the use of                          a computer operating system, media player, codec or digital                          rights management system specified by the copyright holder                          in order to gain lawful access.                          Identification of Class 3:                           Sound recordings and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures) embodied in copies and phonorecords, protected                          by access control mechanisms employed by or at the request                          of the copyright holder which tether the lawfully made                          copies and phonorecords to a particular digital playback                          device.

Identification of Class 5:                          Sound recordings, literary works (including computer programs                          and databases), and audiovisual works (including motion                          pictures), protected by access control mechanisms by or                          at the request of the copyright holder which require,                          as a condition precedent to granting access, that the                          user directly or indirectly disclose personally identifiable                          information to the copyright holder other than such information                          as is reasonably necessary to complete a bona fide business                          transaction.                         Identification of Class 6:                          Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                         Identification of Class 7:                          Works embodied in copies or phonorecords that have been                          lawfully acquired by users or their institutions who subsequently                          seek to make noninfringing uses thereof.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            Summary                          of Argument for Class 1 Exemption:                           This proposed class is narrowly crafted to permit lawful                          use of access control technology (hereafter “ACT”)                          to protect exclusive rights or the copyright holder while                          providing a public safety valve in the event a copyright                          holder uses ACT to prevent the access needed to perform                          a work privately, thereby extending copyright-holder control                          beyond the limits of the copyright grant and infringing                          upon lawful (and noninfringing) uses encouraged by the                          Copyright Act.                         The exclusive right to perform a work privately has never                          been granted any copyright owner. It is always a non-infringing                          use. The performance right is specifically limited in                          subsections 106(4) and 106(6) to the exclusive right to                          perform a work “publicly.” As a result, it                          can never constitute copyright infringement to perform                          a work privately. Nevertheless, many copyright owners                          are making the right to perform their works privately                          exclusive to themselves by using ACTs to condition the                          grant of a license to reproduce a work into copies or                          phonorecords on the licensee’s conveyance to the                          copyright holder of control over private performances.                          This conveyance may be carried out in part by a required                          End-User License Agreement (“EULA”) (see proposed                          Class 4) and carried out by the use of ACTs.                          When copyright holders employ ACTs to control lawful                          uses of works – uses that fall outside of the scope                          of the exclusive rights of the copyright holders –                          they are misusing ACTs to expand the scope of their copyrights                          and infringe upon rights reserved to the public. Since                          such use of ACTs does nothing to protect copyrights from                          infringement, but has the sole purpose and effect of capturing                          for the copyright holder a right Congress reserved to                          the public, it would serve the public interest without                          impairing the rights of the copyright holder to permit                          the lawful circumvention of such ACTs for the purpose                          of privately performing these works.                         Summary of Argument for Class 2 Exemption:                          Since the beginning of copyright law, authors have relied                          upon the creativity, ingenuity, business skill, invention,                          and competition of others to disseminate their works to                          the public. Until just recently, authors generally had                          no means to distribute their works to the masses themselves.                          Indeed, copyright law must have been invented precisely                          because reliance upon private contractual terms in which                          the author attempted to maintain privity of contract with                          each person receiving a work was a very poor method of                          promoting science and the useful arts, or even serving                          the author’s economic interests. Copyright law lifted                          the “business” burden from authors, and provided                          for a careful balance of public rights that served authors                          as a means of serving the public.                          Thus, even as major companies amassed large copyright                          holdings, it has long been the case that they relied upon                          delivery systems owned or controlled by others. Book publishers                          profited most by not trying to also be printers, paper                          mills or bookstores, music publishers profited most by                          not having to become (or control) vinyl record or record                          player manufacturers, radio and television broadcasters                          relied upon radio and television manufacturers, and so                          on. Today, that trend continues, even as the digital dissemination                          of copyrighted works relies upon ever more complex systems,                          including electronic devices (computers, routers, servers,                          drives, sound cards, speakers) and computer software (media                          players, codecs and security software).                         This system of keeping the exclusive rights of copyright                          holders within strict limits has served us well. There                          is absolutely no “copyright interest” to be                          advanced by permitting copyright holders to leverage their                          lawful copyright monopolies into dictating which computer                          operating systems, media players, codecs or digital rights                          management systems must be used by those exercising licensed                          exclusive rights of reproduction or public performance                          or, worse, by those exercising rights that have never                          belonged to the copyright holder, such as the right to                          perform a work privately.                          Recognizing this, our judiciary has produced a long line                          of cases condemning the use of one copyright to bolster                          the value of other material, copyrighted or not. Provision                          of an exemption is a necessary corollary to respect for                          the limits upon the copyright established by Congress.                          Allowing competition in the development of competing technologies                          used in the dissemination of copyrighted works serves,                          rather than hinders, the public interest in copyright                          law. Allowing such competition in no way impairs the exclusive                          rights of copyright holders. Suppression of such competition,                          in contrast, can serve no public interest. Accordingly,                          where copyright holders seek to use technological devices                          to enlarge their limited rights into control over broader                          non-exclusive areas of public and private discourse, over                          technology, over various distribution systems, over media                          channels, and over the Internet itself, the public must                          have at its disposal the freedom to use its own technological                          devices to break free.                         Summary of Argument for Class 3 Exemption:                           Copyright holders are increasingly employing technological                          devices to deny access to works which, once lawfully made,                          are attempted to be played on devices other than the one                          to which the copyright holder has “tethered”                          the copy or phonorecord. As in the case of proposed Classes                          1 and 2, such tethering does nothing to advance any legitimate                          interest of the copyright holder. More importantly, tethering                          serves to deny downstream users the ability to access                          the works, completely voids application of the first sale                          doctrine and the operation of Section 109 of the Copyright                          Act, destroys all lawful trade and commerce competing                          sales, rentals, lending and gifts that might compete with                          “original” access in a monetized transaction                          benefiting the copyright holder, and denies access to                          copyrighted works to those millions of Americans who,                          due to lack will or means to pay full price for a “new”                          reproduction, rely upon the used market, public libraries,                          private lending and gift economies to satisfy their thirst                          for learning, art and entertainment.                         Summary of Argument for Class 4 Exemption:                          With increasing frequency, copyright holders are using                          ACTs to require assent to EULAs as a condition precedent                          to gaining access to copyrighted works. Some EULAs can                          have public and private benefits if they spell out rights                          of the copyright holder that are being licensed (or not)                          to the end user. Others, however, require users to agree                          to give the copyright holder additional rights denied                          to them in the Copyright Act.                          In some cases, the copyright holder may use the ACT to                          require the user to give the copyright holder control                          over noninfringing uses that fall entirely beyond the                          scope of the copyright. Such would be the case of EULAs                          giving the copyright holder control over non-exclusive                          rights such as nonpublic performances of a work, for example.                          In other cases, the ACT will be used to require assent                          to waiving limitations placed upon the copyrights, such                          as the limitations in sections 107-122 to which all section                          106 rights are subject. An ACT used to require assent                          to terms preventing the lawful redistribution (meaning                          redistribution of physical objects) of lawfully made copies                          and phonorecords would be but one example.                          When the purpose and effect of an ACT is to enlarge the                          scope of the copyright beyond the limits imposed by Congress,                          the EULAs themselves should be void as against public                          policy. Naturally, any use of ACTs to require assent to                          such EULAs should be considered copyright misuse. It would                          serve the public interest without harming any rights of                          the copyright holder to permit circumvention of ACTs used                          by copyright holders to leverage the licensing of lawful                          rights into assent to copyright-enlarging EULAs.                          Summary of Argument for Class 5 Exemption:                          The courts have already recognized the application of                          the First Amendment to the protection of anonymous speech.                          Congress has further extended such protection to the private                          sector by prohibiting private disclosure of personally                          identifiable information concerning users of audiovisual                          works, literary works and other materials used by library                          patrons. This proposed class furthers the dual objectives                          of the Copyright Clause of the Constitution and the First                          Amendment to the Constitution by allowing users of copyrighted                          works to circumvent efforts by copyright holders to require                          that they disclose personally identifiable information                          as a condition precedent to obtaining access.                         Just to be clear what this class does not do, this exemption                          would not invalidate a requirement that persons seeking                          access disclose personally identifiable information where                          necessary to complete a bona fide business transaction,                          such as in the provision of credit card information or                          account-holder information for payment. Rather, this exemption                          would only mean that everyday actions such as preventing                          a DRM from reporting to the copyright holder the identity                          of the user of a lawful reproduction as part of separate                          data-mining activities of the copyright holder would not                          be actionable as a violation of Section 1201(a).                          Summary of Argument for Class 6 Exemption:                          This exemption is identical to an exemption currently                          in effect, 37 C.F.R. § 201.40(b)(2). Because there                          are already market examples of such malfunction, damage                          or obsolescence that prevent noninfringing use for which                          the product was intended, this exemption should be extended                          for another term.                          Summary of Argument for Class 7 Exemption:                          This proposed class follows the proposal of the National                          Telecommunications and Information Administration (“NTIA”)                          in its September 29, 2000 letter to the Register of Copyrights.                          As the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information                          explained at the time on page 4 of the letter, “this                          construction is appropriate because the definition of                          classes of works [in Section 1201(a)(1)(B)] is not bounded                          by limitations imposed by Section 102(a) of the Copyright                          Act, but incorporates an examination of ‘noninfringing                          uses’ of the copyrighted materials.”                          The greatest appeal of this Class 7 is its simplicity                          (making it easy for the average citizen to understand),                          its comprehensiveness (covering all noninfringing uses),                          its furtherance of the pubic interest (by encouraging                          unfettered use of lawfully acquired content), and its                          incentive for copyright holders to facilitate lawful uses                          rather than to impede them (by discouraging copyright                          holders or their licensees from using access control technologies                          to infringe upon the public’s rights).                          A major substantive difference in Class 7 as previously                          proposed by the NTIA from the other classes proposed herein                          is that this exemption would apply without regard to whether                          the ACT was imposed by or at the request of the copyright                          holder. The other proposed classes would not create an                          exemption for competitive business models offered independent                          of the copyright holder and which do not unlawfully extend                          the scope of the copyright holder’s copyright monopoly                          through use of ACTs.

Such evidence has played an important role                          in                          litigation such as the _Mainstream Loudoun v. Loudoun                          County Library_ library censorware case, or the Children's                          Internet Protection Act (CIPA) case. Studies of censorware                          blacklists are vastly hindered by not being able to access                          those blacklists. In particular, studying structural,                          architectural issues, such as ""loophole"" sites,                          requires                          access to the decrypted blacklist.

Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit                          access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.                         3. Literary works, including computer programs and databases,                          protected by access control mechanisms that are at high                          risk of failure in the near-term future because of malfunction,                          damage or obsoleteness. In order to invoke this case,                          the potential malfunction, damage, and/or failure must                          not be due intentional damage meant to invoke this clause.                         4.

Literary works (including computer software and databases),                          musical works, and motion picture works which are region                          encoded, and for which the nearly identical product except                          for being keyed for a region containing the United States                          does not exist for mass-market consumption within the                          United States.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            1.                          Previously, the Librarian of Congress decided to exempt                          this class of works from the access provisions of the                          Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Research done                          under this exemption has resulted in a number of findings,                          many of which are of interest to the general public. It                          is therefore requested that this class be considered for                          renewal.                         2. The Librarian of Congress previously decided to exempt                          ""literary works, including computer programs and                          databases, protected by access control mechanisms that                          fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage or                          obsoleteness"" from the access provisions of the Digital                          Millennium Copyright Act's access previsions for the current                          exemption period. And just like the previous period, literary                          works are still subject to malfunction, damage, or obsoleteness.                          It is therefore requested that this class be considered                          for renewal.                         3. The Librarian of Congress previously decided to exempt                          ""literary works, including computer programs and                          databases, protected by access control mechanisms that                          fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage or                          obsoleteness"" from the access provisions of the Digital                          Millennium Copyright Act's access previsions for the current                          exemption period. But during my personal reading of the                          Library's explanations, I did not notice any discussion                          on how to handle works that are likely to fail in the                          near-term future.                          It is therefore requested that the Librarian of Congress                          either renew the previous exemption case with an additional                          clause permitting, or to add an additional allowed case                          to allow recovery of works likely to fail in the near                          term future, when such failure is not intentionally aggravated                          to invoke this clause.                         4. Sometimes, access control mechanisms only allow a                          user indirect access to a work. A literary work may be                          sealed away in a vault, stored on a medium sealed inside                          another, accessed only indirectly via an interpreter,                          etc.                           Such situations often leave the work's owner/licensor                          no clue as to the health of the literary work itself.                          It is therefore critical that a user be able to access                          a work itself as well as its storage medium in order to                          determine its status. This case is meant to compliment                          case #3.                          5. This case was contained within case #2 as a permissible                          reason to bypass an access control for the current period.                          But the fact that this was allowed was only made clear                          by the Library's comments. When a copyright holder, company,                          or other party in charge of maintaining an access control                          fails to support users of said access control means, the                          access control technically has not malfunctioned, been                          damaged, or become obsolete; rather, the access control                          provider is just being stubborn.                          It is therefore requested that the Librarian of Congress                          renew case #2 as before, but also clarify it by adding                          this case. Since the final report in response to the previous                          comment period covered this contingency, adding this case                          (assuming case #2 is renewed) should be a trivial matter.                         6. Previously, the Librarian of Congress decided that                          this class of works did not qualify for an exemption.                          However, the Librarian did admit that this situation will                          have to be revisited should the situation change.                          Since the time of the previous rulemaking, a number                          of factors have occurred that changed the situation. Major                          retailers have announced they are discontinuing and/or                          decreasing sales of non-region encoded products offerings                          in favor of region encoded ones. General sales estimates                          have shown sales of some of these to exceed those of the                          non-region encoded forms, with the likelihood of the variety                          of certain non-region encoded items to be shortly cut                          back and/or discontinued.                          Region coded works, while providing the copyright holder                          with some benefits, also provide the consumer with significant                          drawbacks. Only ""mass marketable"" items tend                          to be sold in any given market, restricting those whose                          tastes do not match the average person’s. Prior                          to the DMCA, those with different tastes from the mainstream                          were able to import works from other countries. Region                          coding, combined with other existing legislation, prohibits                          this in many cases.                          An argument was made during the previous comment round                          that people wishing to use foreign works that contained                          region-code access controls could simply purchase products                          capable of playing them. But given these products are                          typically sold in foreign markets, they may not meet U.S.                          standards for import and/or sale. Products that can handle                          works from multiple regions often limit the number of                          times they can switch between regions, severely hampering                          owners of multi-region collections of works. Furthermore,                          the cost to purchase all the necessary support equipment                          can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of importing                          the work itself, when there is no difference in storage                          formats other than that due to the region access code.

II. Technological measures designed to control access                          to and use of eBooks and other literary works in electronic                          media are currently being implemented in a manner which                          fails to permit access by individuals with visual or print                          disabilities who utilize ""screen readers"" or                          similar text-to-speech or text-to-braille devices as aids                          to perception. Fewer than 10% of books published in the                          United States are ever made available to such individuals                          in accessible formats (such as braille or ""talking                          books"") that are not subject to access controls.                          Moreover, the availability of works in such formats is                          typically delayed until months after a work is first released                          to the general public.

Historically, book publishers                          relied upon printers and paper mills, player piano roll                          manufacturers relied upon player piano manufacturers,                          vinyl record manufacturers relied upon record player manufacturers,                          radio and television broadcasters relied upon radio and                          television manufacturers, and so on. This paradigm persists                          today as the digital dissemination of copyrighted works                          relies upon increasingly complex systems, including electronic                          hardware (computers, routers, servers, drives, video and                          sound cards, monitors, speakers) and computer software                          (operating systems, browsers, media players, codecs and                          security software).                         However, the goals of copyright are not advanced when                          copyright holders are permitted to leverage their lawful                          copyright monopolies into control over which computer                          operating systems, browsers, media players, codecs or                          digital rights management systems must be used by those                          exercising licensed exclusive rights of reproduction or                          public performance or, worse, by those exercising rights                          that have never belonged to the copyright holder, such                          as the right to perform a work privately.                         American jurisprudence is replete with cases condemning                          the use of copyright to leverage market power in related                          or adjacent markets for other products or services, copyrighted                          or not. Although the question whether prosecutors or private                          parties may obtain relief from such abusive practices                          is not before us, provision of an exemption is a necessary                          corollary to respect for the limits upon the copyright                          established by Congress and reaffirmed in the courts.                          Allowing competition in the development of competing technologies                          used in the dissemination or use of copyrighted works                          serves, rather than hinders, the public interest in copyright                          law. Allowing such competition in no way impairs the exclusive                          rights of copyright holders and inherently benefits consumers                          and innovation.

Class #2 (DVD Region Coding): Audiovisual works stored on                        Digital Versatile Disks (“DVDs”) that are not                        available in Region 1 DVD format and access to which is                        prevented by technological measures.                        Class #3 (Unskippable DVD Advertising): Audiovisual works                        released on DVD that contain access control measures that                        interfere with the ability to control private performance,                        including the ability to skip promotional materials.                        Class #4 (Public Domain Film on DVD): Audiovisual works                        that are in the public domain in the United States and that                        are released solely on DVDs, access to which is prevented                        by technological protection measures.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            “Copy-protected”                          CDs are intended to prevent the unauthorized reproduction                          of sound recordings. Unfortunately, the technological                          protection measures involved can malfunction so as to                          make the copy-protected CDs unplayable in certain playback                          equipment. A consumer should be entitled to take steps                          to restore the playability of such a CD. To the extent                          this activity may constitute a violation of Section 1201(a)(1),                          consumers should be exempted from liability.                         DVDs are region coded, so they can only be played on                          a DVD player coded to the same region as the DVD. A substantial                          and growing number of Americans wish to view foreign DVDs                          that are not available in Region 1 versions. An exemption                          is required to allow these consumers to modify their DVD                          players to view their legitimately obtained foreign DVDs.                         Movie studios are able to make certain DVD content “unskippable”                          during playback. Some studios have abused this feature                          by preventing the skipping of advertising shown prior                          to the start of the feature presentation. DVD owners should                          be entitled to eliminate these mandatory ads, or, in the                          alternative, defeat the “UOP blocking” feature,                          and should enjoy an exemption from DMCA liability when                          they do so.                         Public domain works are increasingly being released or                          re-released only on CSS-protected DVDs, which preclude                          consumer access to, and use of, these works for a range                          of non-infringing purposes. To the extent that the Librarian                          considers that public domain works which are stored on                          CSS-protected DVDs fall within the prohibition in Section                          1201(a), an exemption to circumvent CSS is required for                          consumers to access and use these public domain works.

The exemption requested is to permit circumvention of                          the region coding mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                       Summary                                            Audiovisual                          works on DVD video discs currently are released with a                          ""regional locking"" mechanism that prevents discs                          manufactured in one part of the world from being played                          on DVD players or DVD-ROM drives sold in other parts of                          the world. This region coding functions as an access control                          as per subsection 1201(a)(1)(A). We argue that this access                          control causes substantial adverse impact on devotees                          and students of foreign cultures or languages since a                          significant quantity of foreign audiovisual material is                          available for purchase only on DVDs coded for use outside                          the United States. Specific markets are discussed and                          examples offered. Such individuals are forced to spend                          hundreds of dollars on specialized yet essentially redundant                          equipment in order to view the material they have purchased.                          The remedy proposed is to allow such individuals to circumvent                          the region locking mechanism on their DVD playback device                          for the purpose of noninfringing viewing of materials                          in the exempted class.                         The Library's reasons for rejecting such an exemption                          in 2000 are reexamined in light of marketplaces changes.

TITLE 17: CHAPTER 1: Sec. 117(a)(1) of the US Code.                          This section properly covers the essential processes of                          utilizing programs on computers (complex electronic devices                          that arguably anything with microprocessors [most playback                          devices and appliances] would have such status).                          Why is the DMCA circumventing the law on copyright? Playing                          audio involves this exact process of decoding (and copying                          the data to a buffer) prior to directing the audio to                          its output (usually speakers). The copyright law allows                          for this essential need. While it would be better to have                          this section of the DMCA repealed, the only other logical                          choice is make audio information exempt.                         TITLE 17: CHAPTER 1: Sec. 107(4) of the US Code.                          The fair use clause allows for reproduction of a work                          under certain conditions. Subsection 4 is arguably the                          most important as it requires the consideration of the                          effect of this copy on the value of the work.                         If the work was properly purchased, what possible negative                          effect is placed on the work by allowing the purchaser                          to play this same recording on the player of his/her choosing                          for the sole purpose of his/her private use? The answer                          is it has no negative effect... even if the listener has                          to copy it from the original recording to the audio playing                          device (like an ipod).                         I am not arguing that music should be free, that there                          shouldn't be copyrights or anything of the like. I am                          arguing that the rights of the purchaser are being removed                          by my government! If I chose not to buy records from some                          draconian and bullying entertainment conglomerate, a small                          company could grow and fill the niche of leaving me with                          the rights due a legitimate customer. However, this is                          no longer possible since I am subject to the DMCA even                          if company concerned with my rights and preserving my                          freedoms is selling me a recording.                         Imagine for a moment that you lose all rights related                          to recordings. You have to play it on a specific player.                          The player licensed to decode it might be sold only by                          the recording vendor or perhaps it is only sold through                          one computer software company. It would be illegal to                          play the recording on a player or the PC I own, I'd have                          to get a different one. THAT is ridiculous. If you think                          this isn't going to happen, you are mistaken. This law                          is written such that the player can be dictated to the                          consumer as it is the only method allowed to decode the                          work. Legally the consumer won't be able to use a different                          player and manufacturers of alternative players will likely                          get sued for circumvention of the ""protections""                          put in place.                         The only way to preserve fair use is to support the exemption                          of all media from the DMCA bill which tries to supersede                          other, better written, laws like those of copyright law.

For example,                          if I buy a compact disc, it should be within my rights                          to make a copy for my cassette player, my .mp3 player,                          or any other format for which I own the hardware.

The section interferes with many legal, non-infringing                          uses of digital computing and prevents scientists and                          technologists from circumventing access technologies in                          order to recognize shortcomings in security systems, to                          defend patents and copyrights, to discover and fix dangerous                          bugs in code, or to conduct forms of desired educational                          activities.

Making such ephemeral recordings                          to computer servers is necessary for most Internet webcasting.                          As Congress recognized in enacting the section 112(a)                          exemption to liability for circumvention for the purpose                          of making of a single ephemeral recording, the circumvention                          capability requested by DiMA implicates section 1201(a)(1).                          An exemption therefore is justified for the narrow purposes                          of making permitted multiple ephemeral recordings, so                          as to facilitate Internet webcasting.                         Factual and legal support for this exemption is set forth                          in the attached document.

I would like to give an example of copying for personal                              use and a few common ways that this private is implemented                              that I feel should be protected:                              The copying: Making copies of digitalized works for                              archival and backup purposes.                              Often the medium upon which digitalized products are                              shipped is of low quality, regular use of the medium                              often leads to deterioration of the medium making                              it either unusable or making the use of the product                              less enjoyable than was planned. By archiving the                              product, the information therein can be used/enjoyed                              without the risk of further damage to the original                              medium. It is common knowledge the well-cared for                              LP's last much longer than music CD's.                              Personal use over home-networks: According to the                              DMCA it would be illegal to make copies of the protected                              works no matter what the intended use. If I want to                              enjoy a music file, that is protected, through my                              PC, by following the DMCA I would habe to block my                              CD-ROM to use the file. If I could archive the files,                              I would still have access to all of the functions                              that the PC allows, and be able to enjoy the music/film                              etc.                               I am a US citizen an registered voter currently living                              in Germany, this does not relieve me from my responsibility                              to voice my concerns when I feel thta the rights of                              US citizens are being infringed upon.

Heard                          of them? Probably not. They are all (very) local Maine                          artists that I have played on my radio shows on our 110-watt                          college music station. The artists get little-to-no exposure                          beyond our college station's broadcasts. They can potentially                          benefit immensely from a wider (internet) audience. Please                          consider an exemption for college radio stations. The                          artists benefit. The ""harm"" is the denial of                          an expanded exposure for these struggling artists and                          the loss (by the potential listeners) who will never get                          to hear these artists.

As a self published, distributed, and promoted musician,                        I can personally attest that such outlets are vital in reaching                        an audience. The consolidation and dwindling competion of                        the broadcasting and publishing industries has made it very                        difficult for small artists to gain exposure. Already, a                        number of small/amateur broadcast outlets have been forced                        to close as a result of the royalty rates set recently.                        Some of our friends in the music industry have thereby lost                        their only broadcast connection to their audience, and thus                        have lost the only significant marketing tool available                        to them. Small broadcast outlets must be permitted to thrive                        economically for the independent music community to thrive                        as well.

Digital media commonly used to distribute motion pictures                          and other audiovisual works have a finite lifespan. There                          is yet no experience that the lifespan of digital media                          equals or exceeds the lifespan of familiar analog media                          used for analog motion pictures and other audiovisual                          works.

GX271-39-0000000	"Kenai Community Library TECHNOLOGY PLAN 2000-2003 VISION STATEMENT The Kenai Community Library endeavors to provide resources and services that will meet the ongoing information needs of the residents of the City of Kenai and the surrounding area within the Kenai Peninsula Borough. Access to current information technology is an essential element to carrying out this mission. High-speed Internet access and other information technologies has become a necessity for the staff to adequately perform traditional library tasks such as book acquisition, cataloging, interlibrary loan and reference services. These technologies now include an electronic magnifier for the visually impaired, fax and telephone service, CD-ROMs, a microfiche/microfilm reader printer, a photocopier, automated library catalog and circulation system, a dial-up link for at-home users and full Internet access. The Kenai Community Library is a small Alaskan library funded by the City of Kenai that offers free access to all of its resources. Additional and improved electronic resources will enable the library and its users to gain information from a variety of sources available regionally, nationally, or globally. The Internet, with its resources, proves to be an invaluable tool for Alaskan residents who, by their geographical location, might otherwise be isolated from educational opportunities. Patrons can employ these emerging technologies to assist them with their personal growth and prepare them for employment opportunities. Through the use of additional information technology, the Kenai Community Library will be able to offer access to resources otherwise beyond its financial means and its space constraints. Participation in the Universal Service Fund discount program will mean that the library will be able to continue to offer these and additional services well into the next century.   163 Main Street Loop Kenai, AK 99611-7723 Library Director- Ewa Jankowska  GOAL 1  IMPROVE ACCESS TO LIBRARY COLLECTIONS Objective: Make Library's catalog available through the Internet FY 2000-2001 Purchase Windows NT server and other hardware components from Ameritech Purchase graphic Dynix WebPAC software Send two staff members for Dynix WebPAC training Redesign the Library web page that would serve as a gateway to the catalog FY 2001-2002 Replace all text-based terminals with PCs Add printers Create databases mounted with the catalog  such as community information, bestsellers lists, specialized bibliographies, etc. FY 2002-2003 Review the existing online catalog  upgrade to the newer version and/or consider a different vendor GOAL 2  IMPROVE AND PROMOTE LIBRARY'S REFERENCE SERVICES Objective: Improve the existing telephone system FY 2000-2001 Replace the existing system with Norstar Compact ICS LS/DSS and standard software Replace the existing telephones Install one cordless phone at the circulation desk Add one jack and wire Install an answering machine FY 2001-2002 Add a cellular phone to communicate with remote storage Objective: Enhance access to electronic reference sources FY 2000-2001 Redesign Library web pages;

Internet access shall be made reasonable, fair, and equitable to all users. 2. Internet communications shall be considered private and confidentiality will be encouraged within the limits of a public environment, the technology of the equipment, and the requirements of law. 3. Violations of library guidelines and engaging in certain prohibited practices in Internet use may lead to the suspension or revocation of Internet access through the Library. Guidelines for Responsible Use It is expected that the user of the Internet: 1. Shall make only authorized access to systems, netware, software, and databases for educational, informational, and recreational purposes only. 2 . Shall avoid the sending, receiving, and displaying of text or graphics that may be reasonably construed as sexually explicit or offensive. A written definition of what constitutes ""sexually explicit"" material is available at the front desk. 3. Shall obey the law and regulations in their application to copyright, licensed software and data. 4. Shall be aware that violations of these guidelines for responsible use may lead to the suspension or revocation of your Internet access within the Library.  Statement of Responsibility 8   163 Main Street Loop Kenai, AK 99611-7723 Library Director- Ewa Jankowska The Internet with its highly diverse and often controversial content is an unregulated resource and can be used only at your own risk. Beyond its home pages, Kenai Community Library cannot control the information found on the Internet and is not responsible for its accuracy, correctness nor its suitability.  * A Special Note to Parents Internet's ""user friendliness"" and intrinsic flexibility to access a wide range of well known and many lesser known information resources demands diligent and thoughtful parental supervision. It should be understood that the Kenai Community Library cannot act as a censor nor substitute parent. It is the responsibility of the parent to provide the oversight to ensure their children's use of the Internet in an appropriate and safe manner. Internet Offerings and Limitations 1. Library access to the Internet is available at work stations that use software designed to browse the World Wide Web (WWW). Dial in access is not available through the library. 2. You will need a current Kenai Community Library card in order to check in for computer use. You may use the computer one time per day, up to one hour. 3. You may not use your own software programs on the library computers. This will help prevent computer viruses that are common on public computers. 4. Bring your own used disk, formatted for an IBM PC compatible, if you wish to save files. There is a system printer for printing at $.25 per page. 5. Misuse of the computer or Internet access will result in loss of your computer privileges. 6. Because of library scheduling, Internet-trained staff may not always be available.

Introduction             The Free Library of Philadelphia provides access to information in              all formats, including electronic formats. Electronic resources are              defined in this document as materials which are accessed through computers,              terminals, or computer networks as well as the equipment itself.             This document is designed to provide instruction to staff and public              regarding the resources available, and the proper use of those resources              within the Free Library system in a manner consistent with existing              policies. The Librarys  Policy on Electronic Resources              and the Internet  will be issued as a separate document.             II. Electronic Resources                            A. Workstations               Under the supervision of the administrative staff, Library agencies                are responsible for:                               establishing and enforcing computer use schedules, including                  posting of time limits, implementing a sign-up process (in-person,                  telephone, etc.), and maintenance of user waiting lists.                  designating computers to be reserved for those using the Librarys                  electronic resources, and computers for those using the computers                  for recreational activities (unstructured Internet searching,                  etc.). These responsibilities include clearly indicating the uses                  for which the computers are assigned, and maintaining separate                  sign-up sheets.                  providing access to workstations without restrictions based                  on the age of the user.                 implementing Library policies on printing and fees for service.                 scheduling workstations for special programs, such as school                  visits, or programs.                             Computer users are not required to have a library card in order                to use the Librarys electronic resources within Library agencies.                The use of the Librarys resources from other locations, however,                may require that the user have a library card. Agency staff may                encourage computer users to register for a library card so that                they can take full advantage of all of the Librarys services.                Some Library agencies have received private funding for the establishment                of technology labs for the technical training of the public. While                these extensions of service are valued by staff and public, they                tax the resources available for technical support. The Library cannot,                therefore, continue to accept projects which would expand these                services beyond current commitments. Staff are  not  to encourage                the general public, or potential donors regarding gifts of this                kind.               B. Electronic Materials               The Librarys electronic materials collection includes, but is                not limited to CD-ROMs, diskettes, online search services, Internet-based                databases, the Librarys public access catalog, the Librarys Web                site, and World Wide Web sites linked from the Librarys Web site                or catalog. These materials are designed to serve the same basic                purpose as other Library materials; that is, to ""be guided                by the principle that the Library is an educational force, an intellectual                and cultural center, and a catalyst for economic and community development.""                 (Materials Selection Policy, PS #56, p.1)               Electronic materials are developing rapidly in both their content,                and the options for delivery to users. In selecting materials, the                quality of the content  its accuracy, authoritativeness, completeness,                currency and uniqueness, the relevance to the entire collection,                and the ease of use will be considered of primary importance.               Electronic materials are made available with the following provisions:                               All electronic materials provided to both the public and the                  staff are subject to copyright restrictions.                 All electronic materials are provided according to agreements                  with the materials producers/vendors. The terms of these agreements                  must be adhered to by both staff and public, and will be posted                  as necessary.                 If an electronic resource requires verification of the users                  right to access it from computers outside the Library system (authentication),                  the Library will determine the formula, method, and procedure                  for issuing such authentication. User authentication is not transferable.                 No software installed on Library computers may be copied without                  authorization by Information Technology Division. No software                  installed on Library computers may be copied for use on a non-Library                  computer.                 No software may be installed on, or downloaded to Library hardware                  without authorization by Information Technology Division. Software                  includes, but is not limited to, computer programs, helper applications,                  and CD-ROM-based products.                 No changes may be made by staff or public to any Library software                  that has been installed on Library equipment without authorization                  by Information Technology Division.                             All user requests for specific electronic materials will be reported                to the Collection Development Office through the Materials Request                Form currently in use.               At this time, no software is circulated to the public. Some print                materials are produced and packaged with diskettes and/or CD-ROMs.                These materials are circulated as books with inserts.               C. Internet               The Free Library seeks to balance the users free access to information                with the Librarys mission, and with the concerns and needs of other                users. The Free Library assumes responsibility for information contained                in its Web site. Electronic databases, and sites which are linked                to these pages and/or cataloged by Library staff, become part of                the Librarys collection and meet the selection criteria listed                in the Librarys Materials Selection Policy. Other Internet sites,                even though they may be accessible, have not been evaluated by Library                staff. Internet users are responsible for the particular points                they reach.               The structure of the Internet, and the nature of an open-access                computing environment allow users to access some sites which are                problematic for the following reasons:                               Internet sites may not provide reliable, accurate, complete,                  and up-to-date information.                 Internet sites change rapidly and may not be available, or access                  may be very slow at certain times.                 Internet users may access sites which provide information and                  images which fall outside the scope of the Librarys mission,                  and which may be inappropriate for viewing in a public library                  setting.                 Children who use the Internet may need monitoring, and guidance                  from parents or caregivers. The Library will support parents and                  caregivers in understanding the Internet, and how their children                  can use it safely.                             The Library does not, at this time, limit access to the Internet.                The Library will, however, continue to pursue technical capabilities                to provide parents and caregivers with an option for restricting                access for their children.               Communication through the Internet               Although access to means of communication through the Internet                is available, it is not guaranteed.               Electronic Mail               Access to and use of electronic mail on the Internet is growing.                Although the Library does not support use of email for interpersonal                communication, computer users make significant use of it. Staff                may assist computer users with accessing and using personal email.                If email is being used as part of a school assignment, or as an                option for forwarding data retrieved from electronic resources,                staff should assist users in accessing and using it. Staff will                also assist users, and provide access to computers if use of email                is part of a Library-sponsored or Library-supported program.               Chat Rooms               The Library does not encourage, or support the use of chat rooms                by computer users unless they are part of a Library-sponsored or                Library-supported program. Library staff will ask users to close                out chat rooms if they are violating ""Library Standards of                Acceptable Behavior."" Staff may actively discourage unattended                children from using chat rooms.                         III. Staff Use of Electronic Resources                            A.  Technical Training for Staff               Training of staff is essential to the performance of their duties                in providing access to electronic resources, and assistance to the                public. Information Technology Division is responsible for all technical                training within the Free Library. Public Service Division staff                is responsible for training on the content of electronic materials.                Priorities for technical training of staff are based on the staff                members need for training in tasks required to perform the duties                of their current positions, not their inclinations or interests.                Information Technology, in consultation with Public Service, is                responsible for insuring that all staff members receive the technical                training needed to perform their jobs.               B. Staff Instruction of the Public               Library staff will provide a similar level of instruction and assistance                with electronic resources as they provide with other resources.                All Public Service librarians and library assistants are expected                to be able to perform the following tasks on a routine basis:                               use workstation keyboards                 enter and exit programs and databases                 load and change diskettes                 use documentation, print and electronic                 operate the printer                 refer users to appropriate staff for help in formulating searches                 report and follow up on hardware and software problems                             All Public Service librarians are expected to be able to perform                the following tasks:                               know the electronic materials that are available, and the types                  of questions for which each can be used                 perform searches of electronic materials                 interpret basic error messages                 refer users to pertinent sections of documentation                 assist users in performing routine operations                             Staff will assist users in accessing any electronic resource, but                staff are not expected to work through every step of any program                with individual users. At the staff members discretion extra assistance                can be provided as time permits. Assistance with manipulating personal                data, such as resumes, term papers, etc., may be considered beyond                the normal level of assistance.               When the standard level of assistance to an individual becomes                problematic, staff should offer options such as documentation in                the form of books, manuals, tip sheets, Library programs, and referral                to training workshops.               Staff will answer telephone requests for information from the Internet                under the same guidelines of time and resource availability as are                used with print materials. (See PS #40 Reference and Readers Advisory                Service)               C. Staff Use of Electronic Resources               In order to become proficient in the use of electronic resources,                staff must use them on a regular basis. Through access to the administrative                systems, electronic mail, the Internet, and other information resources,                staff are encouraged to use the Librarys electronic resources to                support operations, enhance communication, and foster professional                development.               The electronic resources located in public areas are designed for                public use. If it is necessary for staff to use a computer located                in a pubic area, staff must not store their work on that computer.                No Library work must be left on a computer used by the public.               Access to electronic resources is solely for the purposes stated                above. Use for other purposes may result in termination of employment                and/or legal action. The Free Library reserves the right to access                all information stored in its computer system for the purpose of                insuring compliance with state and federal laws, and the conditions                listed below:                               Electronic resources may not be used for illegal purposes, including,                  but not limited to unauthorized access to systems, software, or                  data.                 Accounts are not transferable. Individuals will be held responsible                  for the use of their accounts.                 Privacy of other staff must be respected. Accounts belonging                  to others may not be used. Unauthorized staff must not attempt                  to access, delete, or edit files or mail belonging to others.                             Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to the following:                               interfering with the work of others or with their ability to                  use computer facilities                  unauthorized alteration of information in Library records                 abusive, threatening, obscene, or profane correspondence and/or                  chain letters of any kind                 unauthorized sharing of information about access to Library                  systems                 interrupting or degrading the operation of systems or networks                 unauthorized installation of hardware, software, or peripherals                 using electronic resources for personal business, or activities                  unrelated to the Library, including marketing, advertising, fundraising                  or other profit or not-for-profit activities                             Any breach of computer security by staff or users must be reported                immediately to the Information Technology Division. Breaches of                security are grounds for severe disciplinary action that may include                dismissal.               D.  Maintenance               Information Technology Division coordinates the maintenance of                electronic resources. All requests for maintenance and repair must                be communicated through the Help Desk. Routine cleaning of electronic                equipment including the screen, keyboard, mouse, etc., as determined                by Information Technology, should be part of the general housekeeping                in agencies.                         IV. Public Use of Electronic Resources             According to the Free Librarys Policy on Electronic Resources and              the Internet, the Librarys priorities for public use of electronic              resources, in priority order, are the following:                           access to resources unique to the Free Library               access to resources acquired for specific projects of programs               access to information for which there is no print equivalent at                any agency               access to databases and resources which duplicate in whole or                in part print versions               access to educational software               access to word processing, resume writing, and data processing                                                  Anyone who uses the electronic resources of the Free Library is subject              to the Librarys guidelines as a condition of that use.                            A. User Responsibilities               Because the publics demand for electronic resources exceeds the                Librarys ability to provide access, the Free Library reserves the                right to limit individual use. Guidelines for users are established                for the entire Library system, but schedules for use, sign up procedures,                and time limits are established within an agency. See Section II.                A.               Parents of minor children must assume responsibility for their                childrens use of the electronic resources through the Library,                and for monitoring, limiting, or controlling the Internet activities                of their children.               The Library assumes no responsibility for any damages, direct or                indirect, arising from use of its World Wide Web server, or from                its connection to other Internet resources.               Computer users are responsible for the following:                               using resources appropriately.                 maintaining the security and privacy of their personal data.                 respecting the integrity of the Library files as installed and                  configured by the Library.                 resolving any problems related to the invasion of their own                  privacy or loss of data. The Library assumes no liability for                  damage to the computer users data or for any damage or injury                  arising from invasion of the computer users privacy.                 storing all data on diskette. The Library may delete any information                  saved on or written to its system by computer users.                             B.  Limitations on Use               While access to electronic resources is provided equally to Library                users, there are necessarily some limitations on that use. Use is                limited in the following ways:                               Personal system software, programs, or data may not be installed                  or stored on Library computers or computer systems.                 Personal system peripherals or hardware may not be attached                  to Library computers or computer systems without authorization                  by Information Technology.                 Personal laptop computers may be plugged into electrical outlets                  in agencies, but not into data lines. Personal paper may be used                  only after staff have determined that it is compatible with printing                  capabilities.                 Computer users may not use Library resources for commercial                  activities.                 Computer users who access the Librarys electronic resources                  from non-Library computers or systems are subject to all applicable                  guidelines contained in this document as a condition of signing                  onto the system.                 Computer users should be aware of computer viruses and other                  destructive computer programs, and take steps to avoid being victims                  or unwitting distributors of these processes.                 When working with resources which include audio and/or visual                  elements, users must not use sound or images in ways which disturb                  other users or staff. Library staff will determine if one users                  activities are interfering with the activities of other patrons                  of the Library.                 Users must abide by computer use schedules set by individual                  agencies.                 Library electronic resources may be used for legal and acceptable                  purposes. Examples of illegal and unacceptable purposes include                  but are not limited to the following:                                       Destruction or damage to equipment, software, or data belonging                      to the Library or to other computer users.                     Unauthorized use of copyright-protected materials. The individual                      using copyrighted material is responsible for any infringement.                     Violation of Library computer system security or structure.                     Unauthorized use of computer access codes or passwords.                     Violation of other computer users privacy.                     Disruption of or unauthorized monitoring of electronic communications.                     Violation of telecommunications network usage policies,                      guidelines, rules, or regulations.                     Use of computing systems or facilities in ways which necessarily                      impede or disrupt the computing or library activities of others.                     Any and all other matters which the Library. in its sole                      discretion, and in consideration of the best interests of                      the public, determines to be an unacceptable use.                                                               C. Sanctions               Violations of the guidelines described above for general, legal,                acceptable, and cooperative use of electronic resources will be                dealt with in a serious manner, up to and including loss of Library                privileges. Wanton destruction of, or damage to equipment will be                charged to the individual causing the damage and/or parent or guardian                in the case of damage by a child. Illegal acts involving Library                electronic resources may also be subject to prosecution by local,                state, and federal authorities.                         V. Conclusion             These guidelines concern use of resources that are in a state of              change and development. These guidelines will be reviewed and updated              regularly.                                                                                        Content managed by: Communications and Marketing Department 215.686.5424"

Setting quantitative standards for technology is like nailing jello to a tree. Wisconsin has been able to set some quantities (number of computers and size of workspace around computers.) in setting guidelines for space needs. Beyond these basics, many states have found it difficult to define excellence in the use of technology.   In planning for technology improvements, a library must look at technology in a broad context. Adding x number of computers because patrons are standing in line is not good planning. A library cannot decide to ""add some more computers"" without knowing if the infrastructure (LAN, WAN, etc.) is designed to work well with the additional computers. Specifications for the computers cannot be chosen without knowing the function to be served by the computer. It is not reasonable to increase the number of Internet computers from 10 to 15 without considering that bandwidth may need to be increased and LAN cabling re-evaluated. Just as collection development staff must be aware of community wants and needs, collection policies, collection budgets, shelving space, etc., to do well in developing collections, libraries must know how technology will fit into the services/collections goals of the library.   Setting standards for technology improvement decisions are based on many variables: functions, infrastruture, technical support, etc. Quantitative technology standards are difficult because of technology's relationship to other areas of running a library.   Within this context, some minimum standards for number of computers for the staff and the public can be given, along with some other minimum requirements. Beyond mimimum standards, the Alabama Public Library Service has developed standards to address quality service and collections rather than concentrating on numbers.     Buildings       Buildings should be surveyed for electrical outlets and for locations for   cabling.  Servers should be on own circuits.   Technology related to building programs, new or renovated, is addressed in     Buildings section .     Also, see ""Public Library Space Needs"" at the   State of Wisconsin website:  http://www.dpi.state.wi.us/dlcl/pld/plspace.html    Americans with Disabilities Act -- ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities   (ADAAG)  http://www.access-board.gov/adaag/html/adaag.htm     see also  Acoustics  -- For soundproofing ideas, see the SilentSource web pages:  http://www.silentsource.com/index.html         Technology Planning and Management           A library should have a budget plan that addresses the ongoing cost of   technology, including hardware/software upgrades and maintenance and Internet   services.             Access to a full-time systems manager with full-time computer technicians.     This staff can be within the library, within the city government or     available as contracted service with a nearby university or other entity.           A library should have staff within the library who are regularly trained     to manage/troubleshoot the system.              Cooperation/Collaboration           It is recommended that public libraries contribute to statewide databases,   such as catalogs and union lists of serials.             Access to the databases provided by the Alabama Virtual Library with     output options to include printing, saving and e-mail.       Library Catalog           A library will have an automated library system using PAC, circulation and   cataloging modules.       Library software upgrades are scheduled (lag no greater than one version   behind current version )         USMARC format recommended for catalog records.   Records are   from reliable sources (not usually keyed in from scratch).           Librarians should follow the rules for bibliographic description found in     the latest edition of the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules AACR2 (currently     2nd ed., 1998 rev.)             It is recommended that librarians use the latest edition of the Library of     Congress Subject Headings, to ensure that all materials about a subject will     be consistently listed under the same heading.             It is recommended that public libraries do provide web access to their     library catalogs.             The library is backing up circulation and OPAC data on a regular schedule     - making disks or tapes of that information and keeping it separate from its     original location.           Retrospective conversion of your collection can take from 11/2 to 2 years     depending on the size of your library. You can pay vendors for the     conversion process, however, fine-tuning must be done by librarians to make     sure the database is correct.   Select a vendor based on technical reports of their system, demonstrations   of their systems, and visits to libraries that use their systems. Base   selection of a vendor on the needs of your user population (such as dial-in   access).   Libraries planning networks with other libraries to provide circulation and   public access catalogs should follow the same criteria as above.  Some   other suggestions follow:           A Request for Proposal (RFP) should be developed by the library staff       and should include questions from all departments of the library. The       proposal should be detailed enough to allow the vendors to understand how       your network is to function.       Site visits to libraries using these systems are very important. Discuss       the efficiency of the system with library staff that will use the system.       Be sure that your vendor can supply software that allows each library in       the system to have their own fines and loan period. Some aspects of the       system will have to be a network policy that affects all members.       A library should have the ability to load third party records onto their       automated library system.           Electronic Collections     Libraries should explore enhancing collections through the use of databases and educational programs, available on CD-ROM, DVD and other multimedia/data storage devices.       Technology Training       Written guidelines outline how patrons should be instructed, either in a   group or one-on-one, in the basics of computer use and needed applications,   e.g., Alabama Virtual Library.     A computer lab separate from public computers are recommended for group     classes and hands-on instruction.       The Internet         Remote access for patrons to the library catalog and AVL databases.       Internet Policy lists responsibilities of Internet use.               Refer to  http://www.ala.org/alaorg/oif/internetusepolicies.html .               Internet Policy should be reviewed at minimum every six months.         Signed Internet use agreement should be kept on file acknowledging     guidelines.                 Adopt a comprehensive, written Internet use policy that addresses at least     the following--                      Sets forth reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions             Expressly prohibits any use of library equipment to access material  that is obscene, is child pornography, or is harmful to minors (consistent with any applicable state or local law)                       Provides for the privacy of users with respect to public terminals                       Protects the confidentiality of records, electronic or otherwise, that       identify individual users and link them to search strategies, sites     accessed, or other specific data about the information they retrieved     or sought to retrieve.                    Communicates the relevant policies for use of Internet-access           computers to        all library users, and include the parents of children who may use           the library           without direct parental supervision. Does so in a clear and conspicuous manner sufficient to alert library users that filtering software is not utilized             or is utilized and how.                      Posts notices at all Internet-access computers that use of library     equipment to access the illegal materials specified in the Internet use policy is  prohibited.                       Offers a variety of programs, at convenient times, to educate library     users,  including parents and children, on the use of the Internet. Publicize     them widely.                   Offers library users recommended Internet sites.            Web Pages            A library web site is recommended that describes library services and     collections and containing links to selected related sites.                Hyperlinks on web pages to web-available reference materials and other       pertinent information.                  Web pages are registered with different search engines.                  Meta tags succinctly describe your web pages.                  Webpages are constructed with the objective of training/educating in       service/collection areas emphasized by the library, e.g., genealogy       research.                         Computers and Networking       Minimum Recommendations for Communication Links--       1 to 3 PC's--56K v.90 Dialup Modem     4 to 15 PC's-- ISDN or Frame Relay, or DSL     16 and above --Fractional T1, T1, T3 or fiber       Libraries with 3 or more computers should have a Local Area Network     (LAN)--connecting computers and sharing printers, access to the Internet and     the catalog.   Some computers are designated for staff use only.   The library has created profiles so that groups and users are defined.    Staff and patrons should have controls on what they can  and cannot view   or perform on computers.   The suggested protocol for both LAN's and WAN's is TCP/IP using Static IP   Addressing or DHCP.     The library has written documentation of availability of Z39.50 protocol     [which flavor] for staff and patron use.     The library has provisions for and written documentation describing the     use of portable technologies, e.g., laptops, e-books.     Written guidelines are provided to staff to describe appropriate use of     staff computers, including responsibilities for security and backing up     files.     Written guidelines outline regular maintenance requirements for hardware, software,     files and computer equipment.     A written computer replacement schedule should be in place. Given a     three-year life span, a recommended computer replacement schedule would be     replacing one third of machines each year. (Older machines can be used for     less demanding applications, e.g., word processing.)     A library should have a written basic diagram of their network describing     the physical layout of wiring and functions of hardware and components.     A library has written documentation addressing adaptive needs, describing     equipment available to assist persons with disabilities, training available     and policies/procedures.     A library should use an Intranet to provide information for staff:     training, policies, procedures, guidelines, forms and to offer     opportunities for collaborative work and to streamline the work     environment.                                ********************************   Sources of General Guidelines   Weaving a Secure Web Around Education: A Guide to Technology Standards and Security     A pdf  publication of the National Center For Education Statistics' National Forum on Education Statistics   *******************   All-in-One Web Sites for Technology Issues                        The Library Web Manager's Reference Center       http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Web4Lib/RefCenter/     Internet Software; Assistive Technology; Training Materials; HTML; XML;  Library-Specific Design; Graphics Editors; Clip art olor tools | Fonts| Scripting & Programming; Web Server Administration;   Anti-Virus Measures; System Recovery;  Application Launchers; Session Monitors; Print Managers;| Security Software; Windows;Proxies; Filters;  Metadata...and more.        Last updated   04/19/2003  by Theresa C.

GX001-29-9633431	"EXPLORATORY CENTER GRANTS FOR HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH   RELEASE DATE:  October 16, 2002   RFA:  GM-03-003     National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)   ( http://www.nigms.nih.gov )    LETTER OF INTENT RECEIPT DATE:  February 13, 2003; standard time limit  for P20s  APPLICATION RECEIPT DATE:  March 13, 2003   THIS RFA CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION  o Purpose of this RFA o Research Objectives o Mechanism(s) of Support o Funds Available o Eligible Institutions o Individuals Eligible to Become Principal Investigators o Special Requirements  o Where to Send Inquiries o Letter of Intent o Submitting an Application o Peer Review Process o Review Criteria o Receipt and Review Schedule o Award Criteria o Required Federal Citations  PURPOSE OF THIS RFA  The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) invites  applications for P20 Exploratory Grants that will support multi- investigator teams to conduct research using human embryonic stem cells  (HESC). The purpose of this RFA is to encourage and enable basic  biologists with little or no prior HESC experience to work with HESC  and establish the utility of HESC as a model system by: 1) supporting  the development of an institutional infrastructure for research using  HESC; 2) encouraging research on the growth and maintenance  requirements of HESC; 3) identifying biochemical and molecular markers  of HESC; 4) stimulating research that will lead to a better  understanding of the unique properties of HESC; and 5) supporting pilot  projects that exploit the advantages of HESC as a model system to  further the study of fundamental research problems. The source of HESC  will be limited to federally approved stem cell lines listed on the NIH  Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry, which can be found at   http://escr.nih.gov .   RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  Background  On August 9, 2001, President Bush announced his decision to allow  Federal funds to be used for research on existing human embryonic stem  cell lines. Subsequently, the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry  was created to provide a listing of federally approved Human Embryonic  Stem Cell Lines  http://escr.nih.gov  that may be used for such research.  The availability of HESC for federally funded research affords a unique  opportunity for investigators to use these cells to address fundamental  research questions. However, most institutions and investigators have  little or no prior experience in growing and maintaining HESC and  remarkably little is known about the molecular and genetic properties  of HESC that distinguish them from more differentiated cells.  Therefore, NIGMS hosted a workshop on the Basic Biology of Mammalian  Stem Cells in order to bring stem cell researchers and basic biologists  together to 1) better understand the unique properties of embryonic  stem cells and 2) to consider how embryonic stem cells might be  exploited as a model system to advance the study of fundamental  research problems. The report of that workshop can be found at   http://www.nigms.nih.gov/news/reports/stemcellworkshop.html .  The workshop report summarizes many fascinating opportunities to use  HESC to study important biological problems and identifies activities  that need to be addressed in order to stimulate and facilitate the use  of HESC as a model system. These activities include: continued  interdisciplinary collaborations and discussions between stem cell  researchers and basic biologists; characterization of improved  conditions for the growth of HESC and their maintenance in a  pluripotent, undifferentiated state; characterization of molecular  markers that distinguish HESC from more differentiated cells (including  adult stem cells); and funding initiatives to encourage, enable and  train basic biologists to work with HESC and to initiate pilot projects  using HESC as a model system. As a result, NIGMS is issuing this RFA to  stimulate HESC research and to address these immediate needs.   Scope of Research  The objective of this RFA is to encourage and enable basic biologists to  work with HESC and to initiate pilot projects using HESC as a model  system to study research problems that are central to the mission of  NIGMS. NIGMS supports basic research that addresses fundamental  biological questions. Applicants should visit the NIGMS website at   http://www.nih.gov/nigms  for detailed information on NIGMS areas of  research interest. NIGMS does not support research that is targeted to  specific organ systems or diseases.   Areas of research that are appropriate for support by this RFA include:   1) studies on improved conditions for the growth of HESC and their  maintenance in an undifferentiated state  2) further characterization of the unique molecular properties of HESC  that distinguish them from other stem cell populations (e.g., adult  stem cells) and from more differentiated cells  3) development of reagents that will facilitate the use of HESC as a  model system 4) comparative studies of HESC and adult stem cells or animal stem  cells 5) pilot studies on the use of HESC as a model system to address basic  research problems that may include, but are not limited to: o  regulation of gene expression and gene expression networks  o  epigenetic regulation of gene expression, including genomic  imprinting o  determinants of differentiation, dedifferentiation and nuclear  reprogramming  o  chromosome, chromatin and telomere structure and function o  regulation of cell proliferation   o  the basis of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division  o  signaling pathways required for cell adhesion and cell migration 6) pilot studies on the use of HESC as a primary cell type for drug  discovery.  NIGMS strongly encourages potential applicants to discuss their ideas  with NIGMS program staff and to send a letter of intent prior to  submission to ensure that the application will be responsive to the  NIGMS mission and the intent of this RFA.   Exploratory Center Grant Activities  Exploratory Center Grants will be expected to: 1) establish and support  institutional core facilities that can be used for the growth and  maintenance of HESC, for the further characterization of HESC  properties, and for development of reagents and tools that will enhance  the use of HESC as a model system; 2) propose three pilot research  projects that test the usefulness of HESC as a model system to address  basic research problems; 3) provide research and training opportunities  for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows interested in working  with HESC; and 4) sponsor interdisciplinary workshops or meetings that  foster an exchange of ideas and information between stem cell  biologists and basic biologists. NIGMS expects to bring Exploratory  Center Grant awardees to the NIH at least once during the term of the  awards to discuss progress and exchange information. Travel funds  should be budgeted for this purpose.    MECHANISM OF SUPPORT   This RFA will use the NIH P20 Exploratory Center Grant mechanism.  Applicants will be solely responsible for planning, directing, and  executing the proposed project. This RFA is a one-time solicitation  with an expected award date in September, 2003.   Although P20 Exploratory Grants will not be renewable, NIGMS expects to  issue a subsequent RFA to support full-scale research centers, using  the P50 mechanism. Such centers would have expanded core capabilities  to grow and characterize HESC, to develop tools and reagents needed for  HESC research, and to manage and disseminate experimental data. Such  centers would be expected to support multiple research projects  utilizing HESC to address important biological problems and to offer  research training and community outreach activities. While award of a  P20 Exploratory Grant may enhance an institution's subsequent ability  to apply for a P50 Center Grant for HESC research, receipt of a P20  Exploratory Center award will not be a pre-requisite for submission of  future P50 Center applications.   This RFA uses just-in-time concepts and the non-modular budgeting  format (see  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/modular/modular.htm ).    FUNDS AVAILABLE    NIGMS intends to commit $2 million in FY 2003 to fund two to three new  P20 Exploratory Grants in response to this RFA. An applicant may  request a project period of three years and up to $500,000 direct costs  per year. Costs for major items of equipment or indirect costs  associated with consortium or sub-contractual arrangements will not be  considered as part of the $500,000 direct cost limit. Because the  nature and scope of the proposed research will vary from application to  application, the size of each award also may vary. Although the  financial plan of NIGMS sets aside funds to support this initiative,  awards pursuant to this RFA are contingent upon the availability of  funds and the receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious  applications. Exploratory Center Grants will not be renewable.   ELIGIBLE INSTITUTIONS   You may submit an application(s) if your institution is a domestic  organization and has any of the following characteristics:   o  Non-profit organizations  o  Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges,  hospitals, and laboratories  o  Units of state and local governments o  Eligible agencies of the Federal government    Applications from foreign institutions and for-profit organizations  will not be accepted; however, subcontracts to foreign institutions and  for-profit organizations may be included.   INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO BECOME PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS     Any individual with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to  carry out the proposed research is invited to work with his/her  institution to develop an application for support. Investigators are  not required to have prior experience with HESC. Individuals from  underrepresented racial and ethnic groups as well as individuals with  disabilities are always encouraged to apply for NIH programs.     SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS    The Principal Investigator of the Exploratory Center Grant will be  expected to commit a minimum effort of 25%. Applications may be  considered for Federal funding only if the cell line(s) proposed for  use is listed on the NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry  ( http://escr.nih.gov ). Applications must specify the HESC cell line to  be used and include the NIH identification number in the Description on  page 2. Awards will not be made until access to eligible HESC is  documented.

Sunshine, Ph.D.  Office of Scientific Review  NIGMS 45 Center Drive, Room 3AN.12F Bethesda, MD 20892-6200   APPLICATION PROCESSING: Applications must be received by the  application receipt date listed in the heading of this RFA. If an  application is received after that date, it will be returned to the  applicant without review.   The Center for Scientific Review (CSR) will not accept any application  in response to this RFA that is essentially the same as one currently  pending initial review, unless the applicant withdraws the pending  application. The CSR will not accept any application that is  essentially the same as one already reviewed. This does not preclude  the submission of substantial revisions of applications already  reviewed, but such applications must include an Introduction addressing  the previous critique.  PEER REVIEW PROCESS     Upon receipt, applications will be reviewed for completeness by the CSR  and responsiveness by the NIGMS. Note that applicants are required to  include the NIH code number identifying the eligible cell line that is  to be used in the proposed research. Applications that do not provide  this information will be returned without review.  Applications that are complete and responsive to the RFA will be  evaluated for scientific and technical merit by an appropriate peer  review group convened by the NIGMS in accordance with the review  criteria stated below. As part of the initial merit review, all  applications will:  o  Receive a written critique o  Undergo a process in which all applications will be discussed and   assigned a priority score o  Receive a second level review by the National Advisory General  Medical Sciences Council.    REVIEW CRITERIA  The goals of NIH-supported research are to advance our understanding of  biological systems, improve the control of disease, and enhance health.   In the written comments, reviewers will be asked to discuss the  following aspects of an application in order to judge the likelihood  that the proposed research will have a substantial impact on the  pursuit of these goals:   o Significance  o Approach  o Innovation o Investigator o Environment    The scientific review group will address and consider each of these  criteria in assigning an application's overall score, weighting them as  appropriate for each application. An application does not need to be  strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific  impact and thus deserve a high priority score. For example, an  applicant may propose to carry out important work that by its nature is  not innovative but is essential to move a field forward. If the P20  Exploratory Center Grant application includes distinct subprojects, the  scientific merit of each will be assessed, based on its merit as an  independent effort and its potential importance/contribution to the  success of the overall effort (however, the projects will not receive  separate scores).  (1) SIGNIFICANCE:  Do the PI and other investigators address an  important problem? If the aims of the pilot research projects are  achieved, how do they advance scientific knowledge? What will be the  effect of these studies on the concepts or methods that drive this  field?  (2) APPROACH:  Are the conceptual framework, design, methods, and  analyses adequately developed, well integrated, and appropriate to the  aims of the projects? Do the investigators acknowledge potential  problem areas and consider alternative tactics?  (3) INNOVATION:  Do the projects employ novel concepts, approaches or  methods? Are the aims original and innovative? Do the projects  challenge existing paradigms or develop new methodologies or  technologies?  (4) INVESTIGATORS:  Has the PI demonstrated the necessary experience,  judgment and expertise to lead and manage the Center? Are the  investigators appropriately trained and well suited to carry out this  work?  Is the work proposed appropriate to their experience level?  (5) ENVIRONMENT:  Does the scientific environment in which the work  will be done contribute to the probability of success? Do the proposed  core and pilot projects take advantage of unique features of the  scientific environment or employ useful collaborative arrangements? Is  there evidence of institutional support?  ADDITIONAL REVIEW CRITERIA: In addition to the above criteria, your  application will also be reviewed with respect to the following:  o PROTECTIONS:  The adequacy of the proposed protection for humans,  animals, or the environment, to the extent they may be adversely  affected by the project proposed in the application.  o INCLUSION:  The adequacy of plans to include subjects from both  genders, all racial and ethnic groups (and subgroups), and children as  appropriate for the scientific goals of the research. Plans for the  recruitment and retention of subjects will also be evaluated (see  Inclusion Criteria included in the section on Federal Citations,  below).  o BUDGET:  The reasonableness of the proposed budget and the requested  period of support in relation to the proposed research.  OTHER REVIEW CRITERIA:  o Do the proposed plans for the core appear adequate to grow, maintain  and further characterize HESC?  o Are the choices of pilot projects good ones to exploit the unique  potential of HESC as a model system?  o If the investigators do not have prior experience or preliminary data  using HESC, is their overall expertise consistent with proposed core  activities and pilot studies using HESC? Have they adequately described  plans to acquire additional expertise?  RECEIPT AND REVIEW SCHEDULE  Letter of Intent Receipt Date:  February 13, 2003 Application Receipt Date:  March 13, 2003 Peer Review Date:  June/July, 2003 Council Review:  September, 2003 Earliest Anticipated Start Date:  September, 2003  AWARD CRITERIA  Award criteria that will be used to make award decisions include:  o Scientific merit (as determined by peer review) o Availability of funds o Programmatic priorities.   REQUIRED FEDERAL CITATIONS   MONITORING PLAN AND DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARD: Research  components involving Phase I and II clinical trials must include  provisions for assessment of patient eligibility and status, rigorous  data management, quality assurance, and auditing procedures.  In  addition, it is NIH policy that all clinical trials require data and  safety monitoring, with the method and degree of monitoring being  commensurate with the risks (NIH Policy for Data Safety and Monitoring,  NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, June 12, 1998:   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not98-084.html ).    INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN CLINICAL RESEARCH: It is the policy  of the NIH that women and members of minority groups and their sub- populations must be included in all NIH-supported clinical research  projects unless a clear and compelling justification is provided  indicating that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of  the subjects or the purpose of the research. This policy results from  the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Section 492B of Public Law 103-43).  All investigators proposing clinical research should read the AMENDMENT  ""NIH Guidelines for Inclusion of Women and Minorities as Subjects in  Clinical Research - Amended, October, 2001,"" published in the NIH Guide  for Grants and Contracts on October 9, 2001  ( http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-001.html ); a  complete copy of the updated Guidelines are available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/women_min/guidelines_amended_10_2001.htm .  The amended policy incorporates: the use of an NIH definition  of clinical research; updated racial and ethnic categories in  compliance with the new OMB standards; clarification of language  governing NIH-defined Phase III clinical trials consistent with the new  PHS Form 398; and updated roles and responsibilities of NIH staff and  the extramural community.  The policy continues to require for all NIH- defined Phase III clinical trials that: a) all applications or  proposals and/or protocols must provide a description of plans to  conduct analyses, as appropriate, to address differences by sex/gender  and/or racial/ethnic groups, including subgroups if applicable; and b)  investigators must report annual accrual and progress in conducting  analyses, as appropriate, by sex/gender and/or racial/ethnic group  differences.  INCLUSION OF CHILDREN AS PARTICIPANTS IN RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN  SUBJECTS: The NIH maintains a policy that children (i.e., individuals  under the age of 21) must be included in all human subjects research,  conducted or supported by the NIH, unless there are scientific and  ethical reasons not to include them. This policy applies to all initial  (Type 1) applications submitted for receipt dates after October 1,  1998.  All investigators proposing research involving human subjects should  read the ""NIH Policy and Guidelines"" on the inclusion of children as  participants in research involving human subjects that is available at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/funding/children/children.htm .   REQUIRED EDUCATION ON THE PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECT PARTICIPANTS: NIH  policy requires education on the protection of human subject  participants for all investigators submitting NIH proposals for research  involving human subjects.  You will find this policy announcement in the  NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts Announcement, dated June 5, 2000, at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-00-039.html .  HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS (HESC): Criteria for federal funding of  research on HESCs can be found at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/stem_cells.htm  and at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-02-005.html .   Only research using HESC lines that are registered in the NIH Human  Embryonic Stem Cell Registry will be eligible for Federal funding (see   http://escr.nih.gov ). It is the responsibility of the applicant to  provide the official NIH identifier(s) for the HESC line(s) to be used  in the proposed research. Applications that do not provide this  information will be returned without review.    PUBLIC ACCESS TO RESEARCH DATA THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT:  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 has been  revised to provide public access to research data through the Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA) under some circumstances.  Data that are (1)  first produced in a project that is supported in whole or in part with  Federal funds and (2) cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency  in support of an action that has the force and effect of law (i.e., a  regulation) may be accessed through FOIA.  It is important for  applicants to understand the basic scope of this amendment.  NIH has  provided guidance at   http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/a110/a110_guidance_dec1999.htm .  Applicants may wish to place data collected under this RFA in a public  archive, which can provide protections for the data and manage the  distribution for an indefinite period of time. If so, the application  should include a description of the archiving plan in the study design  and include information about this in the budget justification section  of the application. In addition, applicants should think about how to  structure informed consent statements and other human subjects  procedures given the potential for wider use of data collected under  this award.  URLs IN NIH GRANT APPLICATIONS OR APPENDICES: All applications and  proposals for NIH funding must be self-contained within specified page  limitations. Unless otherwise specified in an NIH solicitation, Internet  addresses (URLs) should not be used to provide information necessary to  the review because reviewers are under no obligation to view the  Internet sites. Furthermore, we caution reviewers that their anonymity  may be compromised when they directly access an Internet site.  HEALTHY PEOPLE 2010: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to  achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of  ""Healthy People 2010,"" a PHS-led national activity for setting priority  areas. This RFA is related to one or more of the priority areas.  Potential applicants may obtain a copy of ""Healthy People 2010"" at   http://www.health.gov/healthypeople .  AUTHORITY AND REGULATIONS: This program is described in the Catalog of  Federal Domestic Assistance No. 93.821; 93.862; 93.859 and is not  subject to the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order  12372 or Health Systems Agency review.  Awards are made under  authorization of Sections 301 and 405 of the Public Health Service Act  as amended (42 USC 241 and 284) and administered under NIH grants  policies described at  http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/policy.htm   and under Federal Regulations 42 CFR 52 and 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92.   The PHS strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke- free workplace and discourage the use of all tobacco products.  In  addition, Public Law 103-227, the Pro-Children Act of 1994, prohibits  smoking in certain facilities (or in some cases, any portion of a  facility) in which regular or routine education, library, day care,  health care, or early childhood development services are provided to  children.  This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and  advance the physical and mental health of the American people.

Yet the            distinctions between these terms are important when understanding the            roles and responsibilities of board members.            4.1 POLICIES            Policies are written statements that become administrative documents            reflecting the library's and its governing body's goals and objectives.            They also serve as guidelines for the conduct of library personnel in            the performance of their duties. Policies are flexible, which does not            mean that they are made to be broken, but that they are dynamic and            can be changed as the need arises. Library policies should be reviewed            regularly, and, as goals and objectives change, should be revised to            keep them current. As policies are approved by the library advisory            board, a board officer generally submits these policies to its governing            body (the city council for municipal libraries or the county commissioners            for county libraries) for formal adoption. The library director can            advise the board whether or not revisions to existing policies must            be submitted to its governing body for adoption or if revisions can            be submitted to an administrative official for approval. Usually, revisions            involving fees must be presented to the governing body but other revisions            may require only administrative approval. Policies often must be submitted            to the governing body's attorney for review prior to adoption by the            governing body. There are two types of policy: external and internal.                     4.2 EXTERNAL POLICIES            External policies determine the kind of interaction between the library            and its users and the ways in which programs and services are delivered.            These policies should be prefaced by the library's mission statement,            its goals and objectives, and definitions of its primary roles in the            community. The policies themselves may include topics such as collection            development, challenged materials, gifts and donations, circulation            of materials, conditions for issuing library cards, use of meeting rooms,            fines and fees assessed by the library, access to electronic resources            such as online databases and the Internet, and public relations activities.                     As of this writing, Texas public library boards are developing policies            determining public access to the Internet and discussing attendant issues            such as the use of filters, privacy screens, and software designed to            protect users' confidentiality. At this time, policy decisions for this            service area are in question due to the initiation of laws to regulate            these activities in libraries receiving federal funding. Currently,            these proposed laws are in debate but not yet passed, and the resolution            of these laws may affect many Texas public libraries receiving federal            grants. Some local governments already require libraries under their            jurisdiction to either use filters or eliminate the service altogher.            Citizens' rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union are            challenging such regulations in court, and the outcome of these actions            is yet to be determined.            The purpose of the above discussion is to point out that despite efforts            to support intellectual freedom by recommending policies designed to            ensure free public access to library services and resources, occasionally            these decisions are beyond the control of library boards, staffs, and            other intellectual freedom advocates. It also exemplifies the importance            of library board members' staying abreast of legislative issues that            impact their library's services.           return to top            4.3 INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM AND THE FREEDOM TO READ            Well written, duly adopted policies are crucial in a library's defense            and resolution to challenged materials and resources. A challenge occurs            when an individual or a group seeks to remove or limit access to library            materials (books, videos, audio tapes, etc.) or library resources (electronic            media, the Internet, etc.). A ban occurs when an individual or a group            succeeds in convincing the library's governing body to order the withdrawal            of materials or resources from the library.            Although public perception of challenged materials focuses on ""dirty            books,"" there are many reasons other than sexual content that precipitate            challenges to library holdings. History books on the Salem witch trials            have been challenged for their discussion of witchcraft; Laura Ingalls            Wilder's  Little House on the Prairie  books have been challenged            for their treatment of native Americans;  Huckleberry Finn  has            been challenged for its depiction of juvenile independence as well as            its characterization of Huck's friend, Jim. At the time of this writing,            a library's offer of free public access to the Internet can generate            acrimonious debate in Texas communities. Although Internet access is            generally challenged on the grounds of the pornographic content of many            of its web sites, it is frequently challenged on philosophical and political            issues similar to those described above.            At their most disruptive extremes, such challenges can cause sufficient            upheaval that all other work of a library can virtually stop while the            library's board, director, and staff devote their time and energy to            answering citizen inquiries, providing media interviews, planning meetings,            and working with the governing body's attorneys, administrators, and            elected officials to resolve the issue.            The library board's responsibility in these cases is to uphold the            principles of intellectual freedom and the freedom to read. A library's            mission statement may include language providing for ""wide and diverse            collections in a variety of formats;"" or for providing ""a safe and confidential            environment in which users may freely pursue intellectual interests.""            Mission statements including such language place advocates in the position            of defending intellectual freedom as the library's stated mission as            well as on the broarder principle of intellectual freedom. It is essential            that board members, the director, staff, and other library advocates            in the community show respect for opposing viewpoints at all times,            and remain sensitive to the right of all citizens to express their opinions            and concerns.            Intellectual freedom is a term encompassing the broad ideal ""freedom            of the mind"" and includes not only the constitutionally protected freedoms            of speech and of the press, but also, by extension, the freedoms to            hear, view, and read. These freedoms are at the heart of library service            to the public. These are simplistic definitions for complex and volatile            issues. They are presented thoroughly in the American Library Association's            publication,  Intellectual Freedom Manual, Fifth Edition , compiled            by the ALA Office for Intellectual Freedom and published in 1996; and            the Texas Library Association's publication, Intellectual Freedom Handbook,            Fifth Edition, prepared by the Intellectual Freedom Committee of TLA,            also published in 1996. (This manual is available in print and on the            TLA home page at  www.txla.org/docs/ifhbk.html .)                     These books present historical and philosophical overviews of intellectual            freedom issues, as well as interpretations and practical guidelines            and resources available to libraries facing challenges to their materials.            They also provide sample policies modeling protection of users' intellectual            freedom rights. Appendix A of this manual, ""Library Position Papers,""            provides more in-depth discussion of intellectual freedom issues and            includes the TLA and ALA intellectual freedom statements and their interpretations.            Three crucial components of a library's defense against challenges            to its holdings are the materials selection policy, the Internet access            or acceptable use policy, and the policy for handling challenged materials.                     Materials Selection Policy . All libraries should have a written            policy determining the process by which library staff select books and            other materials and resources. The policy will include review sources            and other professional tools used for selection as well as other criteria            for selecting materials.            Internet Access Policy (Acceptable Use Policy) . Each library            offering public access to the Internet must decide how to develop its            Internet access policy. At this time, most libraries have a separate            policy for Internet use; however, there is a trend in Texas public libraries            to incorporate their Internet policy into the body of their materials            selection policy. Issues generally covered in an Internet policy include            issues such as conditions under which a user may access the Internet,            time constraints to allow fair access, use of filters, cost (if any)            for printing, protection of confidentiality, and permissibility of downloading            onto a personal disk. A sample Internet access policy is included at            the end of this chapter.            Policy for Handling Challenged Materials (Reconsideration of Materials).              Many user complaints against library materials can be dealt with            simply through discussion between the library director and the user            making the complaint. If discussion does not satisfy the user, then            a written form should be available for the user to fill out and sign.            The point at which a user files a written statement requesting withdrawal            of the title is the point at which the complaint becomes a challenge.            Subsequent procedures will be delineated in the policy, including some            point at which the user will be invited to attend a board meeting to            formally present the challenge for board review.            The library board should recommend all such policies to the library's            governing body for adoption. As liaison between the library and its            citizens, board recommendation of the policy adds credibility for the            user. Once the governing body adopts the policy, it carries the authority            of governmental resolution or ordinance. These steps provide more favorable            conditions for successfully withstanding a prolonged or united challenge.                     Access to Services and Confidentiality of Users' Records . Two            other intellectual freedom issues citizens and outside agencies occasionally            become involved with are access to services and confidentiality of users'            records and the materials and services they request. These issues are            more fully covered in Appendix A and Appendix B of this handbook.            return to top           4.4 INTERNAL POLICIES            Internal policies determine the way a library provides its services.            Types of internal policies found in public libraries and the issues            they cover may include:                       Circulation  - the types of documents accepted for proof of              residency; items that may not be checked out or renewed; loan periods              on high demand items; chain of command in dealing with disputes over              fines               Reference  - how many reference questions may be answered              per call; the extent to which criss-cross directory service will be              delivered; the extent to which homework help will be provided; the              order in which telephone and inhouse users will be handled during              peak times               Cataloging and technical services  - what to do when a new              version of the Dewey Decimal System is issued; to what extent materials              will be classified; how to code, classify, and shelve special collections;              how vendors will be selected; who selects various types of materials             Safety/Security  - who has oversight for opening and closing              the building; who will be called in emergency situations when the              library is closed; who has oversight for maintaining fire extinguishers;              evacuation of the building in case of fire or other disaster              Intellectual freedom issues  - chain of command in dealing              with user complaints, and points at which complaintants are referred              to the next level; who speaks for the library in various stages of              challenges              Personnel  - who has oversight for scheduling; who has oversight              of time sheets; how many employees may be scheduled to be off duty              at the same time; how scheduling is communicated between departments              and to the library director; who evaluates employees              Collection development  - who selects various types of materials              and formats; who receives various types of review tools; who weeds              various collections and nonfiction titles; how ""last titles"" and discarded              items are handled              New and used materials donations  - who officially accepts              gift books; what types of materials are accepted, and what types are              not; how gifts of used materials are stored and who reviews and selects              them for inclusion into the collection; how donated materials not              selected for the collection are handled              Volunteers  - who is in charge of recruiting, training and              supervising volunteers; who determines assignments for volunteers;              what the criteria are for allowing court ordered community service              volunteers to work in the library; what the dress code is for volunteers                     4.5 PROCEDURES            Procedures are guides to action and are subordinate to and aid in implementing            policies. Procedures describe how a service is to be executed, establish            a method of handling repetitive tasks, and specify how a policy is to            be implemented. Procedures tend to be chronological, listing a sequence            of steps to be performed, or providing a timetable. Examples of procedures            include the steps to be taken to process an interlibrary loan request,            issue a new library card, sign up for computer time, or reserve meeting            rooms.            The library director and departmental supervisors establish and revise            procedures to provide the most effective, efficient methods for carrying            out general operating policies. The library board generally does not            become involved in establishing and implementing procedures unless those            procedures significantly impact the board itself, such as developing            and posting agendas, or determining the content and distribution of            board meeting packets. Staff reports to the board should, however, mention            changes in procedures that impact the public perception of service delivery,            such as procedures for registering for story times. Knowing such procedural            changes prevents board members from being surprised by, and not knowing            how to respond to, users' questions concerning such changes.

GX040-77-3301075	"Descriptive Resource Needs from the Reference Perspective:  Report on a Survey of US Reference Librarians  for the   Bicentennial Conference on Bibliographic Control for the New Millennium   Library of Congress  November 15-17, 2000  by  Carolyn Larson  Business Reference Librarian  Science, Technology, & Business Division  Library of Congress  and  Linda Arret  Network Development Specialist  Marc Standards and Network Development Office  Library of Congress   Final version      This paper presents a discussion of what reference librarians require with regard to the bibliographic control of networked resources, based on 200 responses to a survey of U.S. reference providers and on comments made at an open meeting on this topic sponsored by the Library of Congress at the July 2000 American Library Association (ALA) Annual Meeting in Chicago.     Overall, the responses to the survey reflect the growing reliance of reference providers on Web-based resources. Almost half reported consulting print/microfilm resources and local networked digital resources ""somewhat"" or ""much less frequently,"" than a year ago whereas considerably more than half reported consulting subscription Internet resources, search engines, and other freely available web-based resources  ""somewhat"" or ""much more frequently"" than a year ago.     Approximately forty percent of the responding libraries reported providing access to  online subscription  or  selected free Internet  resources through the OPAC. Most of the remainder  provide access only through web lists or book marks. In contrast, over eighty percent of the respondents indicated that, in their opinion, selected Internet-based resources  should be  included in the OPAC. Overall, respondents suggested that if Web-based resources are included in the OPAC, it would be most useful from a public service perspective if there were records in the catalog for the individual titles included within aggregated resources or within a Web site rather than for the aggregated resource itself or for the top-level Web site only. For those libraries cataloging either subscription or free Internet resources, about two-thirds report providing AACR2 level cataloging. With regard to the cataloging elements most needed for searching, over two-thirds of the respondents selected the following ten: title, subject keywords, URL, author/creator, link to an index/keyword search of the resource itself, controlled subject vocabulary, date of last update, time period covered by the resource, language of resource, and links to table of contents. With regard to those cataloging elements that must be included in the catalog record regardless of whether or not they are used for searching, over two thirds selected the following ten elements in addition to the previously listed ten elements: date of creation, genre, publisher, copyright/access restrictions, relationships to other works, format, geographic coverage, summaries of the resource, other unique identifying numbers and a statement that the resource is peer-reviewed.       In their free text comments, respondents singled out a number of problems with regard to the bibliographic control of Internet resources within the OPAC including: the need for title access for the full-text titles included in aggregator databases; the need to collapse multiple records for multiple versions/formats of the same intellectual content into a single ""record"" for public view; the need for greater collaboration both between public service and technical service departments within institutions and among multiple institutions in the selection and control of these resources; the need to ensure the long-term availability of those networked resources added to the OPAC's through greater attention to archival issues, and finally, the need to develop a single user-friendly ""interface"" that would allow users to link across relevant databases .      Respondents also included comments related to improving search retrieval on the Web at large. These included suggestions focusing on the use of intelligent agents, automated categorization of Web resources, information visualization technologies, and the  application  of concepts from traditional librarianship coupled with the use of XML and innovative technology, most notably in proposals to find ways to match natural language queries with standardized subjects and authorized names and in proposals for encouraging widespread use of unique identifiers for web pages or content including proposals to work cooperatively with selected publishers in order to provide  librarian-created  metadata to publishers which they could add to the HTML headers of their resources.           Survey Focus:         In developing the survey which forms the basis for our presentation, we attempted to address the following:        Standard descriptive elements that professional reference providers believe to be essential in performing their work;     Additional descriptive elements which reference librarians believe would facilitate achieving accurate and useful content retrieval in response to user queries and information demands;    Optimum ""levels"" of library and metadata descriptions (including descriptive/subject/administrative/access metadata) for content retrieval of Web-based resources (e.g. full MARC records; simpler, more structured Dublin Core records);     Traditional concepts, such as authority files, uniform titles, specialized thesauri, that might be incorporated into metadata descriptions to facilitate resource discovery;    Problems which reference providers are experiencing in identifying relevant materials in an online environment which might be addressed through improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies.     Description of survey instrument:   In an attempt to assess reference needs in this area, the survey contained:      some basic questions about how the respondent's library was currently providing access to networked resources (and the reference librarian's satisfaction with current access at their institution). These questions focused on:       distinctions between bibliographic control of subscription and/or licensed resources and freely available Internet resources of ""reference value""       the level of granularity of such bibliographic control and how libraries were coping with bibliographic control of resources supplied by aggregators and database producers.       a series of questions focused on the cataloging elements reference librarians view as most important for inclusion in such records       a series of questions focused on reference providers' reactions to various proposals that have been made for dealing with the cataloging of electronic resources, including:        providing access through separate web lists vs access through the OPAC.        providing different types or levels of control to subscription/licensed resources and ""free"" Internet resources       utilizing some type of ""core"" or ""minimal"" level of cataloging for electronic resources as opposed to full MARC cataloging.        providing single records vs multiple records for resources available in multiple formats (e.g. print and electronically).       a number of open-ended questions about the major problems related to bibliographic control that reference librarians are facing in identifying (or assisting patrons in identifying) pertinent electronic resources and potential solutions to these problems from a reference point of view.       Finally, several questions were also included regarding the size and type of the library, the subject areas in which reference service is provided, the extent of use of electronic resources in providing that reference service, the number of years the respondent had worked in reference, and the respondent's general familiarity with various metadata schemes and projects making use of metadata. These later questions allowed us to consider if there might be differences among the answers given by groups of respondents based on the any of the above factors.        Background on the Respondents:      The Selection Process     Information about the survey (which was posted on the Library of Congress Web site) was sent by email to heads of reference or library directors of approximately 450 U.S. libraries. Drawing on unpublished statistics from the U.S. Dept. of Education showing number of reference transactions, size of staff, and expenditures by reporting U.S. libraries, information in the  American Library Directory , and information on individual library web sites, we endeavored to contact a small, medium, and large public library and a small, medium, and large academic library in each US state[1], as well as a non-academic library from each of the Special Library Association chapters and divisions. In addition, we endeavored to contact each of the US state libraries and the four US national libraries. Each library was offered the opportunity to supply two responses. The survey was also announced at the end of June on a number of reference listservs prior to an open meeting at the July 2000 American Library Association Annual Meeting at which the topic was discussed, and twenty responses were obtained from that posting. A total of two hundred responses (representing one hundred sixty-nine libraries) were received, broken down as follows:        Academic libraries:    70 responses                                                               (representing 58  libraries out of 159 libraries contacted)     Public libraries:      56 responses                                                               (representing 47 institutions out of 151 libraries contacted)     State libraries:   29 responses                                                                (representing 24 libraries out of 46 libraries contacted. Several  state libraries  were not contacted because a valid email address could not be located)                    Special libraries:   22 responses                                                               (representing 21 institutions out of 94 libraries contacted)    US National libraries:   2 responses                              (Both from LC.  The National Library of Medicine, the National Agricultural Library, and the National Education Library were also  contacted, but did not respond.  In addition,  two of the responses in the Listserv category are from LC employees)   Listserv postings:   20 responses       (15 of those libraries identified themselves as ""Academic,"" 2 as ""public,"" 1 as ""private non-profit""; 1 as ""private for profit""; and 1 as ""governmental."")      Total  responses:             200   Total  libraries represented:   169    Total  libraries contacted:      453     In addition, we received 17 direct replies (email or telephone) from librarians indicating that after looking at the survey, they felt that they could not respond. Their reasons varied from the academic librarian who said that between relocating and opening for the new school year, her library did not have the resources to respond, to the state library which indicated its function was more coordination than reference, to a special librarian, who wryly observed that the information center at her organization had been deep-sixed and she was now functioning in a different capacity within the organization. However, most of the libraries in this category gave as their reasons for non-response small size and lack of online databases of any description in their library. The following two comments are typical:     When I looked at the survey, I decided our library should pass the opportunity to respond on to another library from our area since in our small library we have neither an online catalog nor any databases.     When I got to the question about whether access to databases such as those available through FirstSearch was by OPAC or Web, I wanted to cry. I'd be happy if we had  ArtIndex  in electronic form at all, regardless of whether we accessed it from the OPAC or the Web, or both.     Characteristics of Respondents       A little more than half of the respondents (110) report they work in institutions having 1-10 reference staff. Slightly more than half (104) report working in reference less than fifteen years compared with those reporting fifteen or more years of work in reference positions (94); almost one third (61) reported more than twenty years experience. Thirty-eight respondents are part of what we are calling, for want of a better term, a ""metadata aware"" group, which includes those who indicated either ""substantial knowledge"" or ""general understanding"" of at least six out of eleven metadata projects/schemes listed on the survey or who indicated ""substantial knowledge"" of either three and ""general understanding"" of two of these projects/schemes or ""substantial knowledge""of four and ""general understanding"" of one of them.[2]  For the responding group as a whole, there was at least name recognition by approximately half of the respondents for five of the listed projects/schemes.[3]     A few of the respondents reported being in positions in which a single ""reference"" role dominated eighty percent or more of their time: ""expert"" end user, doing searches for patrons [24]; ""trainer,"" teaching others to search (19); or ""author,"" searching in order to prepare guides, current awareness services, training materials, etc. (1). As a group, however, most of the respondents indicated that their time was more evenly split between these three roles.      With regard to the subject areas most frequently searched, the responses indicate respondents are working in a wide variety of subject areas. Multiple responses were permitted on this question: a majority of respondents (118) selected ""general reference"", but there was also significant representation from the sciences, including medicine and technology (86), business (74), humanities (63), and arts (32); other areas mentioned by respondents included government documents, fire safety, newspapers and periodicals, current events and news, and local history and genealogy.      Their searching is primarily text-based, although somewhat less than a tenth did indicate that they spend up to one half their time searching for images. When using Web-based resources, the respondents reported being least likely to turn to such resources (subscription or free) to locate a specific fact, most likely to utilize them when searching for broad information on a particular topic.      Responses to several questions regarding the frequency with which these librarians are searching particular formats in connection with reference work, indicate that, overall, they spent the least amount of their time (under 20 percent) searching local networked digital resources; the remainder of their searching time as a group was fairly evenly distributed among print resources, subscription Internet resources, search engines, and online library catalogs.      Of perhaps particular interest to this conference are the responses to questions comparing how frequently the survey respondents are using various types of resources compared to a year ago. These responses reflect the growing reliance of reference providers on Web-based resources. Almost half report consulting print/microfilm resources (98) and local networked digital resources (90) ""somewhat"" or ""much less frequently,"" whereas considerably more than half report consulting the following types of resources ""somewhat"" or ""much more frequently"": subscription Internet resources (142), search engines (122) and other freely available web-based resources exclusive of search engines and OPAC's (115).[4]         The Current Situation:     How libraries are providing control for Web resources      Karen Calhoun, in her paper for this conference [5], found all seven major ARL libraries which she surveyed were providing discovery and access to selected subscription resources both through the OPAC and via Library-created Web lists. Our survey results suggest a somewhat greater split among our respondents: sixty-eight libraries report access to subscription electronic resources through the OPAC;[6] ninety-seven through web lists alone; (with four libraries leaving the question blank).      Of those sixty-eight libraries reporting access to subscription Web resources through the OPAC,  fifty-seven are cataloging the resource (such as  FirstSearch ) itself; forty report cataloging individual databases within resources such as  FirstSearch , (for example, ""Readers' Guide Abstracts""), whereas only thirty report cataloging full-text titles within such databases.     We also asked our respondents about the level of cataloging provided for these subscription Web resources. Bear in mind that the responses to these questions are those of reference librarians, not catalogers, who may or may not have consulted with catalogers at their institutions before responding. With this caveat in mind, around two-thirds report full level AACR2 cataloging for these resources, whether at the resource, database level, or individual title level, and the remainder indicated either ""some other level"" of cataloging or ""not sure."" This latter group was asked to select from a list those cataloging elements which they typically found in catalog records for subscription Web resources at their institution today. Elements (in order of frequency cited) selected by a majority of those who reported that their institutions catalogued either the resource or the database included: title, publisher, place of publication, URL, author/creator, format [7], date of creation of resource, genre[8], and time period covered by the resource. For those reporting their institution cataloged the individual titles within resources, only title, URL, publisher, format and time period covered were cited by more than half the respondents.      The situation with regard to free Internet resources showed a somewhat greater split. Only fifty-one of the surveyed libraries report adding free Internet resources to their OPAC's. All of them are also creating weblists of selected free Internet resources. An additional one hundred libraries are providing guided access to selected web pages only through bookmarks or web lists; thirteen libraries indicated they were neither developing webliographies nor adding records for such resources to their OPACS, and five left the question blank.           Table 1   Library Access to Web Resources                            Access via Web Lists Only          Access via OPAC Only          Access via Both Web Lists and OPAC              Subscription Web Resources          97          2          66               Selected Free Web Resources          100          0          51         With regard to the levels of cataloging of free Internet resources, of the fifty-one libraries reporting access through the OPAC, thirty-three indicated that these free sites are given full AACR2 cataloging, two reported such sites were cataloged at a Dublin Core level; eleven reported ""some other level"" or ""not sure,"" and five left the question blank. We asked the group reporting ""some other level"" or ""not sure,"" in a follow-up question, to select from a list, those cataloging elements they typically found in catalog records for free Internet resources at their institutions. Elements (in order of frequency cited) selected by a majority of those responding were: title, URL, author/creator, publisher, and place of publication.  In other words, a shorter, but similar, list compared to the elements selected by this group for subscription web resources.               Degree of Satisfaction with the Current Situation      Somewhat surprisingly, by an overwhelming majority (144 of the 195 who answered this question), seventy-four percent indicated that the current method of access for web-based subscription resources at their institution (whether by Web, OPAC or both) was satisfactory for their work as reference providers.       Looking more closely at some of the characteristics of this group -- such as time spent accessing subscription web resources, type of library setting, number of reference staff, years of reference experience, subjects most frequently searched, and level of metadata awareness, we found that the percentage reporting satisfactory access remained fairly constant in all cases with the exception of those respondents working in institutions with more than twenty reference staff. In those cases, the percentage reporting satisfaction with the current mode of access dropped to just over fifty percent.      We might note that somewhat less than half of this satisfied group (60) are providing access to subscription Internet resources through the OPAC, and all that do provide catalog access also report access through web lists as well. Looking at these sixty who are accessing these resources from the OPAC, forty-seven report that the institution is cataloging the online resource itself, [9]  thirty-three, or just over half, report that their library is cataloging at the database level,[10]  while twenty-nine report that the OPAC contains records for the individual titles within such databases.[11] Twenty report that their institution is cataloging at all three levels.     Turning to free Internet resources, a smaller number, (114 out of 191),  but still a majority responded positively to a similar question about satisfaction with access to free Internet resources. Of this group, sixty-nine are accessing these resources only from the Web; forty from both the web and the OPAC, one from the OPAC only; while four reported providing no guided access from either the OPAC or the Web.      Given the relatively large number of respondents who reported that the current situation is ""satisfactory"" for their reference work, it might be tempting to assume that there is nothing more to say and conclude the paper right here. However, if we look at responses in two other sections of the survey -- a series of questions on whether such resources  should  be in the OPAC and a series of free text comments on problems and wished-for improvements -- we discover some interesting things.      First, let us look at the responses to the survey questions on whether web resources should be in the OPAC. In line with some of the discussion on the Alternative Architecture thread on the Conference listserv, eleven of our survey respondents (out of one hundred seventy-five responding) felt that neither subscription nor free Internet resources should be added to the OPAC. An additional twenty-six would incorporate records for subscription Internet resources in the OPAC, but exclude records for free Internet resources. A few added comments to reinforce their position.       Incorporating links to Internet resources from the catalog may open up the catalog to unrestricted Internet browsing which conflicts with Library Board policy, and may also result in lack of access to the catalog if the limited number of work stations are tied up by Internet users.     I have always had some misgivings about offering access to all types of resources at the same time.....We have found it very useful to suggest students keep the idea of the in-hand materials and the method of locating them (the PACs) separate from the virtual web-based resources (periodical databases, Internet databases, etc.) and the more complex methods of searching them.     In some ways, I think the library catalog should be restricted to materials the library actively acquires. Otherwise it is in danger of losing its identity. But I think some kind of cross-reference to other resources would be good.        However, the majority of respondents, including those who also reported that they found their current access satisfactory, came down on the side of adding such resources to the OPAC. Of the eighty-four who reported both that present access is satisfactory and that their institution provides access to subscription Internet resources only through web lists, forty-nine answered ""yes"" to the question on adding web-based subscription resources to the catalog. When asked if it would facilitate access to  individual titles  within subscription databases if records for them were added to the OPAC, the number of positive responses among this satisfied group, rose to sixty-six.     With regard to free Internet resources, thirty-six of the sixty-seven ""satisfied"" respondents who are not currently providing access to selected free Internet resources via their OPAC, answered ""yes"" to the question of whether it would facilitate access to these resources if they were added to the online catalog.""      Looking at the comments of those who reported that access is satisfactory for their work as reference providers, we find additional evidence that these providers still see the need for improvements in that access. Among those who report their current access is satisfactory and who provide access through the OPAC,  we found strong comments from respondents in institutions which do not catalog individual full text titles supplied by aggregators indicating a need for such access, a point even more forcefully brought home by respondents who indicated that the current situation at their institution was  not  satisfactory for their work as reference librarians. Both groups also cited difficulty in determining which journal titles are indexed in which online resources; while subject access for e-journal titles was viewed by others as inadequate. Several respondents pointed to technical problems arising in the OPAC when a single catalog serves a consortium, but access rights or access methods (IP address versus passwords) to individual resources vary by member institution.     On the other hand, among those who found access ""satisfactory"" but who provide access only through the Web, we found comments such as the following:       I think it is important to let customers know if there is an Internet-based version of something in the online catalog. We should let them know that we have the New York Times in hard copy for a certain period, and also on microfilm, and also full-text through a subscription database. Customers should know that they can read the Ohio Revised Code in our Reference section, but that they can also access the text from the Ohio State website.       Among the reasons for dissatisfaction cited by users who access these resources only via the Web:           problems with users and librarians finding or remembering what resources are available:    Although we feature the resources in many ways, they tend to get buried and lose their importance on our webpage.   It is necessary to hold too much information in one's head, that is, to remember all the places (we've already paid for) which might yield pertinent information for the question at hand.      familiar complaints about maintenance and redundancy,    Maintaining lists of links ...on the library web page leads to the need for creating redundant links on the multiple subject guide pages libraries have gotten in the practice of developing. For example, a good biography site probably belongs on every subject discipline page .... but whether multiple people maintain the multiple subject guides or a single person maintains the subject site, every time a new site is added, if it is appropriate for all the subject pages, it has to be added physically to each.      And a reminder of the primacy of the OPAC as a starting point for research which should be encouraging to this audience:    Users are still using the catalog systematically. If these resources are not in the catalog, they are not enough used.   Our online catalog should serve as a comprehensive record of all our resources, regardless of format, so librarians and patrons can tell what we have by looking in one place.                 Descriptive needs professional reference providers feel to be essential      With regard to the cataloging elements reference librarians view as most important for inclusion in catalog records, the survey attempted to address this issue through questions on current use of various metadata elements by reference providers for searching, and their perceived need for the same elements either displayed on the catalog record or as search elements. When the question was phrased as cataloging elements needed for searching only two emerged as being currently used at least fifty percent or more of the time by two-thirds or more of the 191 responding to this question: title (138) and subject keywords(138) . Rephrasing the question to ask what they thought they would use if it were possible to make all of the elements were available to them as searching elements resulted in a considerably expanded list: Of the 196 responding to this question, two-thirds or more indicated the following would be ""essential,"" or ""often useful.""          Table 2   Cataloging Elements Considered Essential or Often Useful for Searching     Cataloging Elements     Total Respondents   (out of 196 responding )     Title   185       Subject: Keywords   178     URL   166       Author/Creator   165       Index/Keyword search of resource   159       Subject: controlled vocabulary   148       Date of last update   143       Time period covered by resource   135       Language of resource   133       Table of contents   132           A specific question distinguishing between the need for elements to be present in the catalog record even if they were not generally used for searching was added following discussion at the open meeting at the American Library Association Annual Meeting  where there was general agreement that all of the elements listed in question 32 of the survey need to be present on the catalog record. [12] As one survey respondent said:       While I may not search by each of the elements listed, they are all occasionally essential in that they provide information by which to evaluate the usefulness of the information relative to my need.       The following elements were selected as being either ""essential"" or ""often useful"" to display in the catalog record by two-thirds or more of those responding to this question.   Table 3   Cataloging Elements Considered Essential or Often Useful for Display        Cataloging Elements   Total  respondents (out of 167 responses)      Title   166     URL   163     Date of last update   160     Author/Creator   157     Subject keywords   157     Language   156     Time period covered by resource   156     Date resource created   150     Genre   144     Publisher   141     Copyright/access rights   141     Subject controlled vocabulary   141     Relation to other works   140     Link to index/keyword search of resource      138     Format   138     Geographic coverage   134     Summary of resource (by librarian)   130     Other identifying numbers (e.g. ISSN, GPO)   129     Link to Tables of contents   126     Summary of resource (by publisher)   119     Statement that resource is peer-reviewed [13]   112            Indeed, we might note that each element on the survey was considered ""essential"" by at least some respondents; the element that was selected as ""essential"" the fewest number of times was a "" link to or excerpt of a review of the resource"" (10 responses). The element selected most often as ""not important"" was ""subject classification code"" (23 responses).      Elements which were selected as ""essential"" or ""often useful"" by less than two-thirds of the respondents included:            excerpts or links to reviews of the resource (95)      place of publication (90)       subject classification codes such as LC or Dewey (79)        One thing that was somewhat surprising to us in looking at the above lists was the relatively low ranking of controlled subject vocabulary[14] compared to subject keywords, particularly since the need for controlled vocabulary was emphasized in the free text comments of just under a quarter of the respondents. In general, we found few differences among the responses in this regard given by librarians by type or size of library, those having more years service as reference providers, with the percentages of respondents rating controlled vocabulary as either essential or often useful hovering around two-thirds for most of these categories. The most pronounced differences appeared among those eighty-six respondents doing concentrated searching in the sciences and technology, where only fifty-three percent indicated controlled subject vocabulary was ""essential"" or ""often useful""; the forty federal and state governmental librarians where eighty-two percent ranked ""controlled subject vocabulary as ""essential"" or ""often useful,"" and the ""metadata aware"" group of respondents, in which ninety percent of respondents in this category selected controlled subjects as ""essential"" or ""often useful.""     The comments of a few who did not rate controlled subject vocabulary as essential suggest that for some at least, it may be a matter of settling for what they view as practical.      Just getting a brief title and keyword record into the catalog would be better than it is now.     I would like speedy cataloging with minimal information.     Several other comments suggested that controlled subject headings broadly applied to resources as a whole cannot make the fine distinctions needed by patrons to focus in on their specific subjects:     And even if we catalog the web site, will the subject headings assigned be extensive enough to make it clear that the ""Voice of the Shuttle: [Web page for Humanities Research"" ( http://vos.ucsb.edu/  )] is a good place to go for links to William Blake, and any other individual author for that matter? This is doubtful. A major search engine would pick this up though.      Additional descriptive elements cited by reference providers       Respondents were also given the opportunity to list additional cataloging elements which they considered to be essential, for searching, or for viewing on the record, or for accessing directly from the record.[15] In some cases respondents expanded on the kinds of information needed in relation to elements in included in our list and we include that information here as well.

Note if portions of ""full text"" resources actually omit certain types of materials. (A ds, graphics, etc)              - note where indexed - including non-electronic indexes.          - enhancement of online version (multimedia, reference linking, etc.)             Optimum ""levels"" of library and metadata descriptions:      With regard to the ""level"" of cataloging needed for these resources, it would seem that the above results indicate that a majority of those responding see a need for description that could be accommodated at the level provided by a ""Dublin Core""-like model. All of the elements listed in tables 1 and 2 can be accommodated by Dublin Core[16] and its qualifiers to distinguish between elements that may be repeated with distinct types of data: such as date created and date updated; subject keywords and controlled subject vocabulary; various identifiers such as URL's, ISSN's and descriptions containing tables of contents versus those containing summaries or other descriptive information. Looking at the elements which were added by respondents as ""essential,"" we see a number that could be accommodated by Dublin Core, as well.     These results also appear to be consistent with Lundgren and Simpson's survey of graduate students regarding their need for various cataloging elements for the description on Internet resources.[17] In that study title, primary author, Internet address, and summary were ranked highest, followed by subject, level of information, titles of related works in print, date created, date updated, access limits, additional authors, recommended software, system requirements, size of file, edition, frequency, and inclusion of graphics.     Print and Online: One Record or Two      Another section of the survey which produced many, many comments related to the problem highlighted by Michael Kaplan [18] in his paper for the conference of single versus multiple records for works appearing in multiple formats: the following librarian perhaps put it most forcefully:     Multiple formats for a single serial title result in much confusion for patrons. Many give up rather than search through multiple records to find what they need .... there is great need for consolidating access to different versions or formats for serial titles. Our catalogers are ""purists"" and want a clean database that will migrate well, but this does not make for a user friendly catalog. We often see 8 to 10 record[s] for the same title: microfilm, microfiche, microcard, online, paper, title changes, etc., etc. Please help!      Trying to balance the strong public service voice for a single record for multiple formats with the technological realities of computer-to computer data interchange of aggregator-supplied data so well described by Kaplan (a method which appears to offer some solution to the equally strong public service call for help in supplying title access in the OPAC to aggregator-supplied titles[19]), a number of our respondents urged that someone find a way, as one put it, to: figure out some way to maintain a clean database to make the catalogers happy and make it user friendly for patrons. Be able to hang multiple formats and holdings information on a single record.""     There should be a way for local control of ""holdings"" within the authority [master] record     Thus, we strongly second the similar suggestion made by Kaplan and urge that an effort be made to develop a means by which records can be merged ""for the public view that are kept separate in the technical services components of our catalogs.""[20]        Improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies         Survey-respondents were also asked to respond to an open-ended question regarding problems which might be addressed through improved interaction between metadata and present-day technologies. Before looking at some of the specific problems raised and the suggestions which our respondents made, we would like to return to the question raised by the Alternative Architecture thread of the conference listserv. Should these resources be in the OPAC at all? Even as reference librarians pointed out over and over again some of the problems of adding Internet resources to the OPAC cited in Barbara Baruth's  American Libraries  article,[21] the majority also made it that they thought selected Internet resources had their place in the OPAC. However, looking at many of the comments supporting the inclusion of these resources in the OPAC, we see one theme emerging over and over again: a unified search interface that is clear and easy to use.        Again, having one place to search that would include relevant resources would make research less fragmented.     In my opinion, it would be better to go to one place (the OPAC) for all resources, rather than to have to search the OPAC for other materials and then hunt for Internet resources by browsing through extensive ""webliographies.""     I'd rather have our users have a seamless way of searching for information...     [The interface for accessing networked resources is a problem because of] lack of ease of use. Simple, easy and familiar are VERY critical and are not there yet.      [Access to free Internet resources is a problem because] they are scattered over a variety of access points. For example, some in bookmarks, some in classroom handouts, others in general subject pages.       We bring these examples up because some of the solutions offered by our respondents actually suggest a more distributed approach, which might well be consistent with Barbara Baruth's observation: ""The future of library systems architecture rests in the development of umbrella software that digests search results from rapid, coordinated searches of a variety of disparate databases-OPACs of locally-held print and audiovisual materials, union catalogs, consortial catalogs of e-books and journals, and specialized digital library collections.""[22]      This sounds similar to us to Kaplan's observation that ""we are beginning to see the development of search interfaces and search engines that will simultaneously search and unify heterogeneous databases consisting of MARC records in all the bibliographic formats, as well as databases comprising all present and future data structures: Dublin Core, EAD, TEI, CIMI, VRA Core, MAB, MAB2, etc.,""[23] and Calhoun's discussion of ""the need to be able to manage loosely federated data from many sources.""[24]     We might note in passing that the concept of using ""simultaneous"" automated searches of multiple databases is under active consideration by the LC-led Collaborative Digital Reference Service (CDRS) project.[25] A recent proposal by Donna Dinberg (National Library of Canada) to the DigiRef team, would make use of captured metadata from bibliographic citations included in responses to users' inquiries to generate automatic searches of appropriate catalogs and databases through the use of Z39.50 protocols, ultimately allowing users to determine local  availability of the materials cited and to initiate a loan or document delivery request, if desired.[26]   Comments from some of our respondents include:         [ I ] would like a more ""relational"" approach. Example, a subject search would bring up a result that includes categories such as 1. [Library Name] Materials, 2. Free Internet Resources, 3. Fee-Based Online Resources, etc.     [There is a need for ] unified searching; cross-platform searching.     We need more automated linages between our Web guides and our online catalog.      .... If the descriptions are part of a federated system where the builders of discovery and access mechanisms have no control over metadata content, there may still be some value in building a search tool that propagates multiple search terms from a single term based on the term variants or equivalents listed in one or more established structures such as authority files or thesauri ... In the best of all possible RDF worlds, a discovery tool should be able to convert a user input search term into the normative form of the term for a given set of metadata, based on the coding of the description itself and offer manipulation of the full panoply of syndetic relationships offered by that particular normative form upon request.     Map specialized vocabularies at the highest level of the hierarchy, e.g. Transportation thesaurus would be mapped to LCSH for general transportation terms such as ""Transportation,"" ""Vehicles, etc."" the user would be alerted to the fact that the data received is from a non-LC collection, in this case the Dept. of Transportation data. The user would be given the option to enter into the specialized database on transportation or remain in the LC online catalog to continue a search.       Many other comments, which may or may not be applicable to searching distributed databases, clearly move beyond manual cataloging of Internet resources in the OPAC to talk about incorporating various automated solutions into the mix. Such comments focused on some of the following problems:      On the ""disappearing"" web:       Perhaps indexed metadata might include ""control numbers"" keyed to URL/path so when harvesters build indexes, any metadata value that returns a 404 error produces a mechanism for that search engine to remove all index terms built from metadata in that control number.     Retrieve ""close matches"" when 404 error occurs, possibly by truncating the search to the ""root"" URL     Additional use of URL and content checking software; perhaps with automated notification service - or even better - automated updating of the metadata record.      More use of unique identifiers for identification of electronic resources; greater use of PURLs or similar technology plus greater use of automated link checking tools.      Archive resources ""of research value""; provide ""traditional"" cataloging only for archived resources.    On Copyright issues:       Set up a system like music played on the radio where any station can play anything and have a formula whereby copyright holders get paid reasonably, but there is little administrative burden on the patron     For issues of copyright, see Mike O'Donnell's paper presented at the May 2000 National Online meeting, where he discusses a proposal for an IP (Intellectual Property) meter. Clicking on (c) symbol would show the information needed to license the content, including ""who owns the material and who publishes the material,"" along with the ""permissions, i.e., ""how the content may be used and what it will cost, ....[ and] the terms of use.""[27] All of this is managed by a copyright clearing house which collects any fees, sends the payments to the publisher with info on who licensed the content, and supplies content to purchaser with a digital marking showing the original source.       Enhanced searching       Enhance existing search engine technology to move beyond matching strings of characters to search concepts or meaning as well through techniques such as disambiguation, contextual and grammatical parsing and use of semantic networks to increase precision.     The ability to fine-tune a search, using such methods as frequency of words or location of words and element identification (such as author, title)     ... better or more exacting search engines within huge searchable databases [would be useful]. I'm not speaking of big search engines like Google, but using this kind of power in smaller subsets like newspaper archives, etc.     Study how nonlibrarian users do their searching.    On use of metatags:         Require records management/life cycle controls (metadata fields) on anything added to a library catalog or web page. Unfortunately, this means you'd lose a lot of good information offered for free but if pushed for in quality publishing circles, [this] might be a selection criteria that might drive the market...       Issuing agencies should include in their metadata the agency name, using a standardized format and they should use controlled subject headings to describe the resource.        Use XML to create specialized tags for necessary data such as author and title. However, I would also want the metadata to be visible to the user so that the information could be used to construct better searches later.       If metatag information was more rule-based, as in standard library cataloging, changes in resource URL's would be less of a problem. Searches on resources that use consistent metadata would have repeatable results regardless of some types of changes now inherent in the web.     Work with selected publishers providing them with  librarian-created  metadata which they could add to the headers of their resources.    On controlled vocabulary:        Ideally it would be beneficial if the ""natural language"" type of search could somehow be automatically screened through an ""authority file"" to eliminate large numbers of false drops. For example, I want material on housebreaking my dog. If as a patron I could type in housebreaking dogs and receive only results on ""dogs- habits & behaviors"" (or whatever the current ""official subject heading"" is) I would probably be happier with the result of my search query.     Among the most expansive and thorough responses to this question were those provided by Gerry McKiernan, Science and Technology Librarian at Iowa State University, curator of Cyberstacks, and field editor for the  Journal of Internet Cataloging . His response to this question on the survey was a referral to his 1999 article in the  Journal of Internet Cataloging [28] and to related resources cited on his web page.[29] In these sources McKiernan refers to a number of projects to facilitate access to relevant Web resources including the use of intelligent agents,[30] automated categorization of Web resources, such as OCLC's Scorpion technology used in its CORC project[31]; information visualization technologies such as the SPIRE(tm) suite of information access and visual analysis tools developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory;[32] and natural language processing programs such as DR. LINK and KNOW-IT of MNIS-TextWise Labs.[33]     We believe that what the above responses suggest is that many public service staff recognize, as Michael Kaplan said in his paper for this conference, that we  are  ""really, really drowning"" in the sea of electronic resources[34], and carefully hand-crafted records for each, is an impossible dream. We need whatever help technology can give us, and we as a profession need to maintain awareness of the possibilities of current research and openly communicate and work with researchers in these areas if these problems are to be solved.      Concluding thought     In conclusion, we might note another theme that surfaced both at the ALA 2000 meeting and in the comments portion of the survey relating to the interaction of public service and technical services staff and departments. On the one hand there was clear evidence of the walls that have grown between reference and technical services, as reflected in the following comments:       It's unfortunate that the structure of our libraries into public and technical services units inhibits communications between reference librarians and cataloguers. This survey should not be about ""my wishes."" It should be about a real conversation that has to go on in the library.     On the other hand, there were also signs of the breakdown of those walls in some places, which librarians described both at the open meeting at the American Library Association Annual Meeting in July 2000 and in comments on the survey. Whether through participation in CORC[35] or through other homegrown efforts at collaborative work between public and technical services in the selection and bibliographic control of web resources[36], these projects easily fit within the framework described by Karen Calhoun in her paper for this conference of the ""typical"" progress of a new electronic resource through the ""resource description"" process at many institutions.[37] Even where there was no collaboration mentioned, there were many comments calling for increased communication between the two departments. In this regard, we found our survey results to be very consistent with proposals put forward by Karen Calhoun on the redesign of library workflows within institutions, making increased use of cross-functional virtual teams for the selection and cataloging of networked resources.     Finally, we would like to point out one additional characteristic of our respondents which we think speaks directly to this point and clearly reflects the importance of the topic of this conference to reference providers. In response to the concluding question on the survey asking respondents to leave their email address or other contact information if they wished to receive additional information about the results of the survey or the Bicentennial Conference, one hundred and nine respondents did so. When was the last time you asked a survey-taker to keep in touch? Clearly, there is interest and concern about this topic in the reference community.                    Notes:         Because of incomplete and inconsistent data for some institutions along with variations in the number and size of institutions in each state,  ""small,"" ""medium,"" and ""large"" were loosely defined, and varied somewhat from state to state and by type of library. Generally, we began by looking at the U.S. D.O.E. data for each state and trying to select one institution with numbers falling in the top quarter, one from the bottom quarter, and one from the midrange of the data available for that particular state, supplementing this information with other sources as necessary.    Respondents were asked to rank their knowledge of the following according to these choices: ""Have used or have substantial knowledge,"" ""Have a general understanding,"" ""Recognize the name only,"" or ""Have never heard of it"": Extensible Markup Language (XML), Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Resource Description Framework (RDF), Dublin Core (DC), Digital Object Identifiers (DOI), Text encoding Initiative, (TEI), Encoded Archival Description (EAD), Cooperative Online Resource Catalog (CORC), Consortium for the computer Interchange of Museum Information (CIMI), Scout Report Signpost, and Jointly Administered Knowledge Environment (jake).    CORC , XML, SGML, Dublin Core, and Scout Signpost.    Only for the category ""online library catalogs"" did a majority report that they consulted them ""about the same"" as a year ago.

At the LC-sponsored open meeting on this topic at the American Library Association Annual Meeting (July 2000) several college and university librarians stressed that information indicating that articles in a title are ""peer-reviewed"" is indispensable in an academic setting; and indeed, among those respondents from academic institutions, just under two thirds (56)  indicated this piece of information was either essential or often useful    Eighty-four percent of the respondents indicated that it is essential or ""often useful"" for controlled subject to appear on the catalog record for networked resources compared to ninety-four percent selecting ""essential"" or ""often useful"" for subject keywords.    As one respondent said: ""I am assuming that ... clicking onto one of the elements [in the bibliographic description] will take you to a page that will have many of the elements I marked as being 'not essential.'
