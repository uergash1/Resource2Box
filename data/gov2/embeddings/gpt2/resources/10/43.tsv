Django makes it easier to build better Web apps more quickly and with less code.                     Meet Django   Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.   Developed four years ago by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed to handle two challenges: the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.   Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering to the  DRY  principle .   Dive in by  reading the overview →   When you're ready to code, read the  installation guide  and  tutorial .      The Django framework    Object-relational mapper    Define your  data models  entirely in Python. You get a rich,  dynamic database-access API  for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.    Automatic admin interface    Save yourself the tedious work of creating interfaces for people to add and update content.  Django does that automatically , and it's production-ready.    Elegant URL design    Design pretty,  cruft-free URLs  with no framework-specific limitations. Be as flexible as you like.    Template system    Use Django's powerful, extensible and designer-friendly  template language  to separate design, content and Python code.    Cache system    Hook into memcached or other cache frameworks for  super performance  — caching is as granular as you need.           Internationalization           Django has full support for  multi-language applications , letting you specify translation strings and providing hooks for language-specific functionality.

A  patched  copy of Boost 1.37.0 distribution   A copy of the latest ASL distribution   Patience     The Easy Way     If you are Inside Adobe    Within Adobe the Software Technology Lab maintains Perforce servers for distributions of both Boost and the Adobe Source Libraries. This is the preferred method of downloading ASL within Adobe, as the Boost sources are already patched and placed correctly. Please see the STLab website for more information on getting ASL this way.  The rest of this document is not for you.      Building the Libraries Automatically    Two automated net install scripts have been written to ease in the downloading and building of the Adobe Source Libraries. Given a development environment, these scripts will do all the downloading, patching and building necessary to get a working build of ASL and Adobe Begin on your computer.  The Windows version can be downloaded from  http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/adobe-source/asl_1.0.40_net_setup.bat   The *N*X (including Mac OS X) version can be downloaded from  http://easynews.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/adobe-source/asl_1.0.40_net_setup.sh   Please also be aware that the script requires use of FTP and HTTP. If you are behind a firewall or cannot otherwise use FTP, the scripts will not work.  The rest of this document is not for you.      The Other Way     Obtaining and Patching Intel Thread Building Blocks    The Intel Thread Building Blocks tbb21_009oss source distribution can be downloaded from  http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/ver.php?fid=122   Decompress the  distribution and move the resulting directory to:     ~/adobe_root/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\ (Windows)    The folder should be named intel_tbb_libraries resulting in the structure:     ~/adobe_root/intel_tbb_libraries/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\intel_tbb_libraries\ (Windows)    It is not necessary to build the Intel TBB library with this release. The Adobe libraries currently depend only upon the headers of the Intel Library.        Obtaining and Patching Boost    The Boost 1.37.0 distribution can be downloaded from  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586      Patching Boost    Decompress the Boost distribution and move the resulting directory to:     ~/adobe_root/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\ (Windows)    The folder should be named boost_libraries resulting in the structure:     ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/ (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\ (Windows)    Boost must be patched with a small number of minor changes. A patchfile with those changes can be found at:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/boost_1_37_0_patch_01.txt (*N*X)  C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries\boost_1_37_0_patch_01.txt (Windows)     Patching under *N*X    You can use the Unix patch command to make the necessary changes, but first make sure all the line endings in the affected files are Unix line endings. To use the supplied patch under Unix issue the following command:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/patch_boost.sh     Patching under Win32    Win32 users can use the patchfile provided, but there are some caveats. First, the patchfile is distributed with Unix line endings, which must first be converted to DOS line endings. If you do not have a program to accomplish this, there is a small command line tool called  leconv  that will do this for you. It is in:     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\tools\    The GNUWin32 project has made a version of patch for Win32. It can be obtained at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32   If you already use boost build, please make sure that the adobe version of bjam will be the one found in your path, since ASL relies on patched support files found relative to the bjam executable.     Build Option 1: Using Boost Build (bjam)    Boost 1.37.0 ships with a single version of the build tool that supports both v1 and v2 syntax. When the Adobe patch instructions are followed, boost build will be upgraded to be able to produce universal binaries on the macintosh, but only when bjam invoked using v2 syntax. V1 files are untouched by the patch. If you will be moving from v1 to v2 syntax then the guide at  http://boost.sourceforge.net/boost-build2/doc/html/bbv2/vs_v1.html  may be of some use.     Building Under Win32    The Adobe Source Libraries have been compiled and tested under MSVC   9. Assuming you have installed ASL to the top of your C drive, the directory structure for setting up a build is as follows:     C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries\  C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\  C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\    Note that the contents of the adobe directories are obtained through the ASL distributions, while the boost directory contains a patched release of Boost.  Building the ASL libraries is handled through a build script that will setup the Boost build system and then build the ASL. Open up a Win32 command line terminal and run:     cd C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries  ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\build.bat    Once this batch file has completed, you don't need to run it again to build ASL. A more efficient way to build ASL would be to open up a Win32 command line terminal, and run:     cd C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries  ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\bjam.exe    You must build from under   the  C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries   directory in   order to assure that all artifacts are built. If you only require   the adobe_source_libraries, but not the adobe_platform_libraries,   you can build from  C:\adobe_root\adobe_source_libraries    instead.     For MSVC 8 Express Users    When we last tested, VC 8 Express was not capable of building Win32 executables out of the box and would fail to build ASL. here are some notes on updating MSVC 8 Express to be Win32/ASL capable:  1.  You must begin by downloading the platform SDK from  Microsoft's website.   If you use the web install you can choose  not  to download most of the SDK components to save time. Only the Core SDK appears to be required.  2.  Copy the ""bin"", ""include"" and ""lib"" directory from the PSDK-installation into ""%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC""  At this point, for example, windows.h should be available within your MSVC installation. This would be a good time to make sure that you can successfully build the IDE project ""Begin"" located in ...\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\msvc_ide\vc8   Another issue was that boost build v2 from boost 1.33.1 did not provide a VC 8 Express savvy msvc-config, so we must configure boost build manually. Follow the next steps to complete VC 8 Express specific preparation:  3.  Choose a ""home"" directory, and add a %HOME% environment variable referring to it. For example, if you chose ""C:\Home"", you would set the env var by opening the system control panel/advanced/environment variables and adding the variable HOME for all users with value C:\Home.  4.  Now create a file in the chosen HOME directory named user-config.jam . The file must contain the following contents (assuming that you installed VC 8 Express in the default location):     import toolset : using ;  using msvc : 8.0 : ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\bin\cl.exe"" ;    5. Open a fresh command window (to pick up the new env var), cd to your C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries directory and invoke ..\adobe_source_libraries\tools\build.bat and you should be on your way.     Building for Mac, *N*X    The adobe_source_libraries component has been compiled and tested under various versions of GCC 4.3.0. The adobe_platform_libraries component is currently not supported under *N*X or cygwin. If you have installed ASL to your home directory, the directory structure for setting up a build is as follows:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/ ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries/ # unused under *N*X/cygwin ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/ ~/adobe_root/intel_tbb_libraries/ # unused under cygwin    Note that the contents of the adobe directories are obtained through the ASL distribution, while the boost/intel directories contain (patched) releases of those third party libraries.  Building the ASL libraries is handled through a build script that will setup the Boost build system and then build the ASL. The build script is called:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/tools/build.sh    Running this script from a command line from the    ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries  directory will begin the build   process.  Once this batch file has completed, you don't need to run   it again to build ASL. A more efficient way to build ASL would be to   open up a command line terminal and run:     cd ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries  ../adobe_source_libraries/tools/bjam    You must build from under the  ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries   directory in order to assure that all artifacts are built. If you only require the adobe_source_libraries, or if you if you are on a platform for which only adobe_source_libraries are supported (*N*X or cygwin), you can build from  ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries  instead.     MacOS X Universal Binary Support    By default ASL is set up to build Universal Binaries for release targets. In order to disable universal binary building within ASL     ~/adobe_root/adobe_source_libraries/Jamfile.v2    and edit the MACOSX case involving the <architecture>combined clause.     Troubleshooting the Build    Build fails to run? Check:        Intel TBB is in the proper place      Boost is in its proper place         Boost was properly patched  Permissions allow execution of the build scripts   Line endings of all files are correct for your platform   Build commands were invoked from proper directory   Do not try to use MSVC 8 Express without following Express-specific notes above   Make sure no other bjam executables will be picked up in your PATH ahead of the adobe provided version.   Don't try to build adobe_platform_libraries under cygwin or *N*X. Only adobe_source_libraries are presently tested on those platforms.     bjam Details    Executing the build script will build various excecutables including bjam (boost build, compatible with version 1 and 2) in a sub-directory named after the platform, and copy it into the ASL tools directory. The build will then cause all libraries including libasl, libasl_dev, and the appropriate pieces of Boost to be built. It will also build and run several test applications. Copious output will be produced, indicating the success or failure of the build and the associated tests. Debug and Release targets are supported. The default is to build and use static libraries throughout, except that DLL versions of platform runtime libraries are employed.  The ""projects"" used by BBv2 are always named Jamfile.v2. Each Jamfile.v2 inherits settings from any Jamfile.v2's that appear in its parent directories, so the Jamfile.v2's in the test directories are relatively sparse.     Jamfile.v2 Miscellanea     Some Jamfile.v2's specify build requirements and settings that will be applied to all users of a library.   passing bjam the -d2 option will cause the commands used in the build to be displayed.   Adobe libs and executables are written to a sub-directory of     ~/adobe_root/built_artifacts/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\built_artifacts\ (Windows)    named according to the build settings. There are also 'bundled'   artifact collections that, if built explicitly via     bjam test/begin//install_program  will appear under:     ~/adobe_root/built_artifacts/install/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\built_artifacts\install\ (Windows)     The required boost libraries, including filesystem, threads,     parts of test, and signal, will be built in a sub-directory of     ~/adobe_root/boost_libraries/bin.v2/ (*N*X)    or     C:\adobe_root\boost_libraries\bin.v2\ (Windows)     It is possible to create an IDE project for MSVC (and probably for XCode, although this has not been tested) that links to the static libs in the appropriate bin folders. In this scenario it is very important to make sure that the compiler and linker settings used in the IDE match those used for the artifacts produced using BBv2. The -d2 option above is helpful for this purpose. If you try this and receive many link errors on Windows it maybe that your C++/code generation/runtime settings are set to /MTd instead of /MDd.     More information on BBv2 can be found at  http://boost.sourceforge.net/boost-build2/doc/html/index.html      Build Option 2: Using an IDE     Building with MSVC 9    There are MSVC 9 .sln and .vcproj files available for use at     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_librariesmsvc_ide\    Opening the begin.sln file and building the 'begin' project will build all the necessary library dependencies (including the needed Boost libraries.)     Building with XCode    There are XCode .xcodeproj files available for use at     C:\adobe_root\adobe_platform_libraries\xcode_ide\    Opening the begin.xcodeproj file and building any configuration therein will build all the necessary library dependencies (including the needed Boost libraries.)     MacOS X Universal Binary Support    To disable building Universal Binaries with the XCode IDE projects, open the top-level xcconfig file for your respective binary. For example:     ~/adobe_root/adobe_platform_libraries/xcode_ide/adobe_xconfig_application.xcconfig    and edit the value in the ""Artifact Architecture"" section. Reloading the XCode IDE projects at that time will cause Universal Binary support to be dropped, building only PowerPC versions of the binaries. Alternatively, you can drop ""ppc"" if you are only interested in building MacTel versions of the binaries.     MacOS X Binary Artifact Compatibility    On Mac OS X there is an environment variable  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET  that can be optionally set to 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, or 10.4. When this variable is set to one of those values, it establishes the minimum operating system version that is supported by your binary artifact. For the Adobe Source Libraries, all binaries are built by default with a minimum compatibility of Mac OS X 10.4.   In bjam, this variable is set in the top level Jamfile.    In XCode, this is managed with the top-level xcconfig file for the binary artifact.     Known Issues     General Issues    We are aware the release is generally quite cumbersome, and are still figuring out how to package releases more efficiently.  BBv2 intentionally builds the debug variant of ASL with ""warnings as errors"" turned on. The release variant is not built with this setting on because of warnings within some library headers in the GCC STL.     Issues Surrounding MSVC 's ""Safe"" Libraries    ASL does not support the non-standard ""Safe"" C and C++ libraries shipping beginning with Visual C++ 8.0. This may result in many spurious warnings from ASL, Boost, and other standards-conforming C and C++ libraries. To suppress these warnings, define the macros     _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    and     _SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    The MSVC command-line settings to define these macros is:     \D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE \D_SCL_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE    The ASL header file  adobe/config.hpp  includes checks when compiling with MSVC 8.0 to make sure these macros are defined. To disable this check, define the following macro before including  adobe/config.hpp :     ADOBE_TEST_MICROSOFT_NO_DEPRECATE=0    The Jamfile at the top of the ASL distribution has this macro defined by default. Another option to disable the warnings in your code is by supressing the warnings with a pragma:     #pragma warning ( disable : 4996 )     Executing Adobe Begin on Windows XP on a Non-Development Machine    When an app is built using a version of MSVC, that version of Microsoft's Runtimes Libraries must be 'findable' by the OS in order to launch the application. Part of Microsoft's solution to this problem includes the embedding of an application manifest file into the application. On development machines, these files are automatically installed in C:\WINDOWS\system32\. The manifest file describes the binary's dependencies to external DLLs, and the OS reads the file and hunts down the dependencies to load them. In a clean-install XP system, the Runtime Libraries for MSVC 7.0, 7.1, 8, and 9 do not exist, which will lead ultimately to the failure to launch applications built with these compilers on non-development machines.  Our current workaround to this problem is to *not* embed the manifest file in the binary directly, but leave it as a sibling to the app. Then the necessary runtime libraries must also be placed as siblings to the app, along with a manifest file describing them to the OS. For some reason both of these steps are required, and then the app will run in a clean XP installation. (Thanks to Ken Silver for being the first one report Adobe Begin failing to load on his non-development machine.)     Feedback    The Adobe Source Libraries have been used with success within Adobe applications to increase robustness and correctness of code. As developers of an open source project, we are confident that there are other success stories outside of Adobe as well. We encourage you to contribute a story of your own:     What is the name of your project?   What is the purpose of the project?   What led you to choose ASL?   Was ASL used from the start of the project? If not, how did its inclusion impact your project? How does using ASL affect your project development as a whole?   How large is your project?   How would you rate the success of your project?   Is there any other interesting information worth sharing?    Submissions will be included in a success stories web page on the stlab.adobe.com site.

We are based in Krefeld, Germany (Marcus) and Wellington, New Zealand (Kai) and are deeply committed to Adobe's webtechnologies Apollo, ColdFusion, Connect, Flash, Flex, Livecycle and Spectra (listed in alphabetical order without any particular preference ;)             Animation by  nectarine                                         « Unit testing with Flex  |   Main  |  CFCamps in Australia »               November 03, 2007       Book review: O'Reilly short cuts - Introduction to Flex 2     O'Reilly has a series of so called  ""Short Cuts"" , PDF e-books that introduce new technologies or major updates of those in a brief, compact way.  Introduction to Flex 2.0  by Roger Braunstein is such a ""Short Cuts"" title and comprises 88 pages full of valuable information for the upcoming Flex developer :)    The author bascially starts explaining the basic concepts of Flex 2, the relationship between MXML and ActionScript and then dives into some more details.    The first chapter is about ActionScript 3 and I can really recommend it as a wrap-up of the particular way Adobe has morphed the language coming from an AS 1 or AS 2 background. It contains information on the Virtual Machines, the new E4X enginge and topics such as methods, properties, classes, reflection etc. It's not an introduction into OO, but it will give you a good grasp on what you need to know if you want to work with AS 3.    Chapter 2 is particularly on Flex. You'll learn to differentiate between Containers and Components and you'll have a look at event handling, data binding, basic MVC concepts in Flex and accessing data from Flex applications.    The third and also the fifth section of the book cover very general topics such as Effects and Transitions, Cursor Management and charting. But Roger also introduces validation and formatting and discusses internationalization along the way.    Stop, I've missed one chapter, haven't I? Right, chapter 4 is actually about extending Flex, i.e custom UI components, custom styles etc. Given that that chapter just spans 10 pages, it's extremly compact and obviously just gives you a view down from 30,000 ft on the different options.    Wrap-up: The book is good and a very handy little tool to have, but do not expect it to be a tutorial to learn Flex from the scratch - that should be obvious, given that it has 88 pages.     So, who is this book useful for? I'd say for people who consider moving to Flex 2 or 3 from Java, Flash or earlier versions of Flex; but also for the not-that-tech-savy manager person who wants to get a better understanding what Flex and the whole RIA fuzz is about. You could also give it to your dev team leader if you want to get her/him interested in the technology.

They are only used by a small amount of           users and they could allow local users to fill up the memory, if they aren't secured properly.  The old web control panel and the disassembler have been removed from the code. They have been replaced with a set of php functions           that allow the same functionality to be implemented in a PHP script. The control.php and the dasm.php files are such scripts. More           information about this can be found in the  README .  A lot of bugfixes which bring us closer to full PHP 5.1 support.        This version is already quite stable and some people are already using it in production environments. Please test this beta2 as good and as much as you can. If you find a bug, report it back to us on the website and if possible add a small snippet of code so we can reproduce it.     Note: always clean the file cache before upgrading. Otherwise you'll get into trouble.    Download    Download it from  sourceforge  The checksums can be found in the release notes on sf.net    Changelog    Changelog since  beta1      2006-04-11  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Silenced the unlock function for win32 until a windows developer can take a look at it.  Updated the README a little more for the new control panel  Added release notes for beta2  Bumped up version to 0.9.5-beta2  Patch for dasm.php form Stadler, see  #23   Fixed typo in optimizer which broke compilation for PHP != 5.1  Released beta2   2006-04-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some typos in dasm.php  Added authentication to the disassembler   2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fixed handling of interfaces. This fixes sf.net bug  #1440575 .        This fix also introduces some changes in the cached object structure so remember to empty your disk caches if you have them. This is always a good thing to do after upgrading btw :)         2006-04-06  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Reverted the change to the handling of ZEND_BRK made by me on 2006-03-17 since it wasn't working as it should. Since this         reintroduces sf.net bug  #1442923  i added some code to prevent this bug using a different approach, by restoring operand types changed           by build_cfg if build_cfg exits with exit code 0.       Since php-5.1 some opcode handlers expect a strict set of operand types, anything else results in 'Invalid opcode' errors. Since           build_cfg changes some operand types these changes need to be reverted once the optimizer finishes. For now the only opcode to           which this all applies is ZEND_FETCH_CONSTANT, which expects either a CONST or a UNUSED in op1 and a CONST in op2 (See          zend_vm_def.h)         2006-04-04  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed some error introduced by fixing some win32 stuff :(   2006-04-03  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Moved the FLOCK stuff to a place so it can be used by eLoader to  Fixed quite some compile warnings on Win32  Updated VC6 project files   2006-03-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the constant that were registered in the debug code. They could only be used in php code and not in the config file. This           handles bug  #29    2006-03-25  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Source code is now shown in dasm.php  Added source-code lines to the returned opcode array in ea_dasm.c   2006-03-21  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Fixed bug  #24    2006-03-17  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Fix for sf.net bug  #1442839  (handling of ZEND_ASSIGN_OBJ by the optimizer)  Changed BRK handling to not bail out of the optimizer prematurely on a multi-level break. This does need some more testing, but           should fix sf.net bug  #1442923   Removed some dead code in ea_store.c and excluded some debug code from compilation in optimize.c   2006-03-09  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Included fcntl.h in ea_info.c, this should fix bug  #13    2006-03-07  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Set refcount to 1 before storing a zval in the usercache. This fixes bug  #4 .  Some formatting cleanups in cache.c  In restore_zval the zval length could be something else then 0 when an empty string was set.  Removed the shorttags in control.php and dasm.php to fix bug  #8 .  Set the svn keywords property to some files.  Moved some function defs from eaccelerator.h to the right files.   2006-03-06  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Removed the old webui and made a new controlpanel and disassembler.  Added php api documentation   2006-03-02  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Changed copyright dates to 2006  Updated the eaccelerator url in some last files  I removed all authors from specific files. Authors can be traced through mmcache and eaccelerator cvs. I did this because some          names should be added to quite some source files while others have added their own while contributing less then the once not mentoined. All contributors are credited in the AUTHORS file and specific information can be found in the Changelog and cvs.   2006-03-01  Hans Rakers <hans at parse dot nl>    Bunch of Win32 fixes. It compiles cleanly now (tested with VC++ 6.0)  Fix to the optimizer for bug  #1439344   Fix to ea_store.c for a build problem on RHEL3 reported on the forums at  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3596327    2006-02-28  Bart Vanbrabant <bart.vanbrabant at zoeloelip.be>    Changed the module entry url to eaccelerator.net and year  Removed the crash function  Disable the keys, session and content cache by default. These could result in a local DoS by cache poisioning                             Download in other formats: Plain Text                   Powered by  Trac 0.10.3    By  Edgewall Software .
