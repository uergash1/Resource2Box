Traffic to the site increased 25% in March, which generated more than 10,000 leads, over 5 million page views and over 60,000 visitor hours on the site.      At the end of 2005, the Miami Herald ran a front-page article announcing the new company, which would revolutionize the way condos are marketed, bought and sold.  Condo.com has lived up to this prediction and is now creating a significant impact in a market that sorely needs positive results.  When the site launched in January 2006 it had 8,000 property listings on the site.  Today Condo.com has over 600,000 listings with inventory valued at $150 billion.      Condo.com anticipated the unprecedented over-supply of condos in major metropolitan areas within the United States and globally, and the resulting challenges this would impose on real estate developers and unit owners. The company creates liquidity for sellers by attracting condo buyers from around the world that are looking for a superset of all available listings.  A review of Condo.com, and the opportunities it brings to the real estate market, gets even the worst real estate skeptics excited.     What makes Condo.com so valuable to the real estate industry is its comprehensive database focused solely on multi-family units for sale and for rent on a global basis.  This database includes inventory from multiple sources including developers and lending institutions that are traditionally not available to consumer markets.  Developer listings, auctions and REO properties are where many of the hot deals are and these remain blind spots for other real estate websites.  Condo.com creates partnerships with developers and financial institutions and provides cost-effective marketing and sales support to market and sell their condo inventory.  Another distinct benefit is the ability to view entire buildings and associated unit inventory as well as entire streets and neighborhoods of condo buildings to see what is available.  This is especially useful for investors looking to buy large blocks of inventory.      Another key value that Condo.com offers to buyers and investors is the ability to find bargains.  Everyone is wondering where the bottom is and using the unique search tools on Condo.com, buyers can efficiently do their research, look at comparisons and act quickly.  e know that part of the increase in our traffic is from bargain hunters looking for deals.

One of the key advantages, aside from more free time, is that Destin Florida condos have been a great investment. They have held their value here as an investment despite economic downturns and problems with some associations. In fact, they have appreciated more in the last few years than when they first came on the scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s, experts say.   Economics  - It's advantageous because there is usually little or no land, so prices remain lower!   Value  - Get into a better Destin neighborhood because you've saved money on the condominium!    Low maintenance  - You don't have to pay a lot for ongoing upkeep.    Privacy  - Many owners enjoy better security, because the complex covers the security needs.    Facilities Amenities  - Destin complexes often come jam packed with facilities, from exercise equipment, fitness items, pools, saunas, and more. The best of all, you enjoy them but don't have to clean them!  More Leisure Time  - No or little time spent on maintenance.   Retiring?
