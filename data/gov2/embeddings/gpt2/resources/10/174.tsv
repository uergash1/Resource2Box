These candies are distributed nationwide and internationally under the brands Kimbo, Asian Taste, Jin Jin and Shen Hsiang Jen Foods. The candies are packaged in small sealed plastic cups.         These candies contain the ingredient ""konjac"" (also known as conjac, konnyaku, yam flour, or glucomannan). The Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration consider this type of candy to pose a serious choking risk, particularly to infants, children and the elderly. Local authorities have reported six children's deaths from choking in the United States associated with this type of jelly candy. There have also been reports of deaths in other countries.    Each mini Jelly cup is about the size of a single size coffee creamer.         The Kimbo Lychee Flavor Jelly is sold in plastic bags containing about 18 cups. The Asian Taste-Konnyaku Fruit Jelly (Lychee Flavor) is sold in 1500 gram plastic jars containing about 105 cups. Jin Jin Tropical Mix Fruit is sold in 1500 gram plastic jars containing about 105 cups. Sheng Hsiang Jen Food Co Mini Fruity Gels (Peach, Lychee, and assorted flavors) are sold in plastic jars.         Walong Marketing, Inc., has requested recall through distributors and retailers to consumers. Consumers are urged to return this product to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at 714-670-8899.         In August and October 2001, the FDA issued general warnings against consuming mini-cup gel candies that contain the ingredient ""konjac"". In December 2001 and January 2002 two other firms recalled gel candies. Although the agency issued an import alert to address importation of these candies in October 2001, candies imported prior to the import alert are still in the US market.         These candies are sold under various brand names, distributed by various companies. The FDA continues to investigate and follow-up this issue.

Raw milk, which            is used to produce these cheeses, gives them distinctive flavors, textures,            and cooking properties. Even though some American companies are producing            Hispanic-style cheeses from pasteurized milk (a U.S. requirement for            cheeses aged less than 60 days), these do not exhibit the full range            of properties of cheeses made from raw milk.                     Researchers at  ARS '            Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania, are            studying Hispanic cheeses to help producers meet the increasing demand            for them. Total Hispanic-style cheese production in the United States            jumped 52 percent from 1996 to 2001, when more than 102 million pounds            were sold, according to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.            In fact, it is one of the fastest growing U.S. food markets, outpacing            the growth of the cheddar and mozzarella markets.            It's Flavor, Not Fire                     Hispanic-style cheese does not mean hot-and-spicy cheese; other ingredients            make Hispanic dishes hot. In general, the cheeses are white or off-white            and moist. They taste like fresh milk. They become soft and creamy when            heated but do not lose shape, run, or separate into greasy solids and            liquids. Most cheeses are fresh, though some are aged. Many are mild            tasting and crumbly. Others are harder and have stronger flavor.                     Chemist Diane L. Van Hekken and colleagues in ERRC's Dairy Processing            and Products Research Unit are studying selected Hispanic cheeses made            in Mexico to better understand how specific processing techniques result            in their desirable qualities. They are looking at the cheeses' chemical            and physical makeup to learn how these properties relate to flavor;            texture, such as chewiness and stringiness; and function, such as the            ability to melt or be sliced. They want to find ways to duplicate these            characteristics by following U.S. practices and standards. Then, they            hope to apply the findings to improving cheese-processing techniques            in general.                     According to Van Hekken, there is not a lot of literature available            for researchers on the characteristics of these cheese types, and so            a main objective is to compile needed references.           In Search of Authenticity                     The researchers are looking at four specific cheese types. The first,            Queso Blanco, may be the most popular cheese south of the border. It            is soft and won't melt. Panela is mild, sweet, and crumbly. Asadero            is a smooth, yellow cheese that is somewhat tangy and good for baking.            And last, Van Hekken's research team traveled to Mexico twice, where            they are working with a collaborator to examine Mennonite-style cheeses            from the state of Chihuahua. These semihard cheeses—named after            the Mennonite settlers who introduced them to the region—are similar            to Queso Quesadilla and Menonita found in the United States.                     ""All these cheeses have been developed for specific purposes,""            Van Hekken explains. ""People can't cook a Mexican-style dish, for            example, with American-style cheese and expect it to taste authentic.            Restaurants that want their dishes to be traditional know this, and            they search for the right cheeses.""                     A sensory evaluation board (taste panel) at ERRC has been working since            May 2001 to define the flavor profiles of both raw and pasteurized cheeses.            MaryAnne Drake, a professor with North Carolina University's Department            of Food Science, helped initiate training for panelists to become human            instruments and to use a common terminology in describing what they            taste.                      The researchers also hope to improve the shelf life of Hispanic-style            cheeses, which will expand their marketability here and in foreign markets            and ensure high food-safety standards.—By  Jim            Core,  Agricultural Research Service Information Staff.

Bulk American cheese is American cheese which is packaged in bulk form. No single piece of cheese, whatever its shape, shall weigh less than 100 pounds.  58.2456 American cheese. American cheese includes the following varieties of cheese: (a) Cheddar cheese and cheddar cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.113 and 133.114, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (b) Washed curd cheese (soaked curd cheese) and washed curd cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.136 and 133.137, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (c) Granular cheese (stirred curd cheese) and granular cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.144 and 133.145, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration. (d) Colby cheese and colby cheese for manufacturing shall conform to the provisions of 21 CFR 133.118 and 133.119, respectively, ""Cheeses and Related Cheese Products,"" as issued by the Food and Drug Administration.  58.2457 Packaging. (a) The primary container (liner) shall be new, in good condition, unbroken, fully protective of all surfaces of the cheese, and properly closed or sealed so as to protect the cheese from damage, contamination or excessive desiccation. If the cheese is handled and stored in only a primary container after cooling, there shall be a satisfactory system for cooling the cheese, retaining the desired shape, and providing reasonable protection of the cheese during transportation, storage, and handling.  Compliance with these standards does not excuse failure to comply with the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 1  1   (b) The secondary container, when used, shall be in good condition and shall satisfactorily protect the cheese. The secondary container shall be of such construction and be filled to a sufficient level so as not to cause handling, stacking, or storage problems. (c) If antimycotics are used, they shall be used in accordance with the provisions of Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR part 133).  58.2458 Degree of curing. (a) Fresh (Current)--Cheese which is the early stages of the curing process, usually 10 to about 90 days old. (b) Cured (Aged)--Cheese which has the more fully developed flavor and body attributes which are characteristic of the curing process, generally over 90 days old. U.S. Grades  58.2459 Nomenclature of U.S. grades. The nomenclature of U.S. grades is as follows: (a) U.S. Extra Grade. (b) U.S. Standard Grade. (c) U.S. Commercial Grade.  58.2460 Basis for determination of U.S. grades. (a) The determination of U.S. grades of bulk American cheese shall be based on the rating of the following quality factors: (1) Flavor. (2) Body and Texture. (3) Finish and Appearance (as determined by examination of at least the filling end). (b) The rating of each quality factor shall be established on the basis of characteristics present in a randomly selected sample representing a vat of cheese. If the cheese in a container is derived from more than one vat, the container labeling shall so indicate by showing both vat numbers, and the grade shall be determined on the basis of the lowest grade of either vat. The cheese shall be graded no sooner than 10 days after being placed into the primary container. (c) The final U.S. grade shall be established on the basis of the lowest rating of any one of the quality factors.  2    58.2461 Specifications for U.S. grades. (a) U.S. Extra Grade.

GX253-68-7987145	"Fiscal Notes      May 2003               Texas candy makers stir up sweet treats       Texas' Sugar Rush        While U.S. sales of confectionery products indicate that America's sweet tooth is growing stronger, Texas sales of sweets have hit the highs and lows of a sugar rush.     Americans ate about 3.1 billion pounds of chocolate confectionery products and about 3.2 billion pounds of non-chocolate confectionery in 2001, says Susan Fussell of the National Confectioners Association (NCA).     ""The candy industry is doing very well,"" Fussell says. From 2000 to 2001 the candy industry grew 1.5 percent, and the chocolate industry grew 2.3 percent, she says.     Retail sales of candy and chocolate products in the U.S. rose from $23.8 billion in 2000 to $24 billion in 2001, according to the NCA Web site,  www.candyusa.org . Except for a slight downturn in 1999, sales of candy and chocolate products have risen steadily in the U.S. since 1994.     Fussell says that economic downturns do not prompt consumers to cut back on sweets.     ""Fortunately, there is candy sold at every price range, so people can modify their budgets and still buy candy,"" she says.     In Texas, however, candy sales tend to fluctuate, sometimes greatly, from year to year. According to sales tax data from the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Texas sales of candy and other confectionery products rose from $48.1 million in 2000 to $48.4 million in 2001, though numbers haven't returned to the state's 1998 high of $87.1 million.     The industry also has consolidated in Texas. The number of confectioners dropped from a 1993 high of 61 firms to 46 firms in 2002.     Despite these fluctuations, Texas candy makers are claiming their part of the nation's billion-dollar candy industry with several Texas confectioners poised for expansion.      Willy Wonka of the West      In March 2002, Susie Hitchcock-Hall, owner of Susie's South Forty Confections in Midland, Texas, moved her operation to a facility five times larger than its previous one.     ""I started in my kitchen in November 1991,"" Hitchcock-Hall says. ""I started with one small kettle, and needed another one in five months.""     She now has 10 full-time employees and 58 seasonal employees.     Susie's South Forty is made up of the factory, an outlet store and one retail store, and Hitchcock-Hall says she is looking for an additional retail store location. She also plans to launch a new line of white chocolate products in summer 2003.     Sweet Shop USA, established in 1972 in Fort Worth, is also set to expand. Sweet Shop USA produces handmade chocolates marketed to high-end department stores and specialty stores, says Anna Parker, with marketing and new product development.     ""If you buy the house-brand chocolates at Neiman Marcus, chances are that the Sweet Shop made those chocolates,"" Parker says.     In July 2000, Sweet Shop USA moved to a 66,000 square-foot facility after its previous facility was destroyed by a tornado. Parker says the new facility has a larger production area and can produce more than 10,000 pounds of gourmet chocolate daily, but she says the company is looking for an even larger location.     In August 2000, Sweet Shop USA acquired Price's Fine Chocolates and Annaclairs of Kansas City, Mo., and Mrs. Weinsteins's Toffee of Santa Barbara, Calif. The brands are now produced in Fort Worth.      Virtual candy store      Local candy stores are gaining new markets through online sales. For many small shops, Internet sales are replacing traditional, mail-order sales.     Lammes Candies Since 1885, based in Austin, includes the company's Web site information in its catalogues. President Pam Teich says that as more people become comfortable with online shopping, they are buying things on the Internet that they used to order through the mail.     The company has nine retail stores located in and around Austin. So far, the Lammes Candies' mail-order department makes up 10 percent of sales.     ""If you take our mail-order department as a whole, it would average in sales to one of our regular retail stores,"" Teich says.     In 2003, Sweet Shop USA began selling its chocolates online as well.     ""It seems to be doing really good,"" Parker says. ""There are more people getting on the Internet and shopping.""      Sweet indulgences      Candy consumers may be getting more health-conscious. Fussell cites recent studies promoting the health benefits of antioxidants found in chocolate and says that requests for sugar-free candies are soaring. In 2002, sales of sugar-free, non-chocolate candy, also called diet candy, were up 23 percent from 2001, she says.     Hitchcock-Hall is working on a recipe for sugar-free chocolates.     ""One in three new customers ask for sugar-free products,"" she says.     Fussell attributes the sugar-free surge to baby boomers.     ""With the soar in the population of baby boomers, there is an increased interest in what kinds of foods make up their diets, and they want to fit sweet indulgences into their lives,"" Fussell says.      Candy stop      A couple of big names in the candy industry have opened manufacturing facilities in Texas, including M&M Mars in Waco and Russell Stover in Corsicana.     Russell Stover's Corsicana plant employs at least 900 people and produces 100,000 pounds of candy daily, says Sandra Madison, the Corsicana outlet store manager.     In addition to being a manufacturing facility, the Corsicana outlet store acts as a tourist destination.     ""We get people from all over the place; some tour buses even put us on their lists,"" Madison says.     ""In the off season, we get at least 150 visitors a day. Christmas is our busiest season, and we can get up to 400 visitors a day.""      Your corner candy store      Though the candy industry seems to be dominated by large candy conglomerates such as Mars and Russell Stover, most communities have a local candy maker, Fussell says. She says many candy operations, even the larger ones, are privately held companies that have been handed down through generations.     ""Ours is a fun business to be in,"" Teich says. ""Most companies our size and smaller are family owned and operated. It's almost like an art form being passed down from generation to generation.""
