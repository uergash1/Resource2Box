Define emergency management, List the different levels of an emergency, Describe the role of the local OEM coordinator, State the difference between Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM) and Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS), and Identify the different types of disasters.  SCOPE C C C C What is Emergency Management? The Role of the Coordinator-(defined) CEM & IEMS Types of Disasters  TEACHING METHODS - The instructor sets the stage by defining what emergency management is and the difference between an emergency and a disaster. The instructor describes the most important role of the coordinator -- obtaining resources, and knowing where to obtain the necessary manpower and equipment. The instructor then talks about Comprehensive Emergency Management and the Integrated Emergency Management System. The unit ends by identifying the different types of disasters.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -6REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   WHAT IS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT? INTRODUCTION Emergency Management is the discipline and profession of applying science, technology, planning and management to deal with extreme events that can injure or kill large numbers of people, do extensive damage to property, and disrupt community life. When these events occur and cause extensive harm, they are called disasters. The word disaster is widely used to describe everything from a flooded basement in New Jersey to the earthquakes in Los Angles, California. Emergency Management makes distinctions between emergencies and disasters. Emergencies are generally ""routine"" events that do not have a community wide impact or do not require the use of resources to bring conditions back to normal. When a community and its response agencies cannot operate within their own standard operating procedures (SOP's) or when they are required to seek additional resources, we move beyond the ""routine"" emergency level of operations. So what constitutes a disaster? A disaster depends largely on the community itself, and its size, resources, and experience in dealing with a certain hazard. It is important that each community develop different levels of progression from an emergency to a disaster. These levels are important in providing guidance to first responders, and even more important, guidance for local officials to make critical decisions that affect you as a citizen. Here are a few examples of emergency levels: Level 1 Any unexpected occurrence that can be met with a single department's available resources. The department that handles the occurrence is usually responsible for the decision making to resolve the incident. Any unexpected occurrence that requires response by two (2) or more city departments above routine capacity or where outside agencies have been requested to assist. The event requires a coordinated effort and commitment of personnel, equipment and resources from the responding departments. The department that handles the occurrence is usually responsible for the decision making process but a cooperative effort with the agencies responding is required. The Mayor is usually alerted about the situation. Any extraordinary occurrence of such magnitude that all departments and resources from the community must be used or where a combination of outside agencies and departments have been mobilized to handle the situation. Decision making is done by the OEM council. On-site commanders make those decisions to protect life and property. Decisions  Level 2 -  Level 3 -  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -7REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   mitigate and properly resolve the situation is the responsibility of the OEM council. This level usually results in a ""Declaration of Emergency"" by the mayor.  THE ROLE OF THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR The emergency management coordinator's role is to use and implement a variety of resources, techniques and skills to reduce the probability and impact of extreme events and to bring quick restoration to the community. Emergency management coordinators are ""key players"" in an emergency or disaster situation. THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE ""IN CHARGE"", BUT THEY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER IS IN CHARGE HAS ACCESS TO THE PROPER RESOURCES, skills, and knowledge necessary to manage the situation effectively. The most important aspect of an effective emergency management coordinator is making sure that the responsibility, authority, and channels of communication are clearly defined BEFORE the emergency happens. There are two (2) concepts that assist and define the roles and responsibilities the emergency management coordinator. They are comprehensive emergency management (CEM) and the integrated emergency management system (IEMS).  COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM) is useful before and after a hazard strikes. Since World War II, emergency management has focused on preparing to respond to emergencies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency adopted this approach for applying the Comprehensive Emergency Management System at the State and local levels. The concept is built on the principle that teamwork, coordination and cooperation among agencies and jurisdictions is essential. Being prepared is only one phase of Comprehensive Emergency Management. A community must also be able to deal with emergencies before they strike and have the ability to recover after a disaster. This is where the concepts of Comprehensive Emergency Management come into play. These concepts are mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. Mitigation activities are those that eliminate or reduce the probability of a disaster occurrence. Also included are those long-term activities that lessen the undesirable  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -8REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   effects of unavoidable hazards. Some examples include the establishment of building codes, flood plain management, insurance, elevating buildings, and public education programs. Preparedness activities serve to develop the response capabilities needed in the event of an emergency. Planning, exercising, training and developing public information programs and warning systems are among the activities conducted under this phase. Response activities include direction and control, warning, evacuation and emergency services; and are designed to address immediate and short-term effects of the onset of an emergency or disaster. They help to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Recovery includes both short term and long term activities. Short term operations seek to restore critical services to the community and provide for the basic needs of the public. Long term recovery focuses on restoring the community to its normal, or improved state of affairs. The recovery period is also an opportune time to institute mitigation measures, particularly those related to the recent emergency. Examples of recovery actions would be temporary housing and food, restoration of non-vital government services, and reconstruction of damaged areas. These phases each have a direct relationship with each other. One phase results from the previous one and establishes the requirements of the next one. Activities in one phase may overlap those in the previous phase. For example; preparedness moves swiftly when a disaster strikes; and response yields to recovery at different times, depending on the extent and type of damage. Recovery should trigger mitigation, making attempts to prevent or reduce the potential of the next disaster.  INTEGRATED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM The Integrated Emergency Management System (IEMS) is a way of settling out the details of Comprehensive Emergency Management (CEM). IEMS requires that a community conduct a hazard risk analysis, assess its current capabilities in the areas of mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, and devise action plans to close the gap between existing and required levels of capability. Implementing IEMS requires 1. 2. 3. A effective emergency organization, An active Emergency Program Manager, The development of a set of emergency management capabilities.  The larger emergencies associated with a catastrophic event will need special attention  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT -9REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   and greater Federal involvement. Initial emphasis will be placed on basic emergency preparedness capabilities -- warning, direction and control, shelter, evacuation and the provision of food, health, medical resources at local levels. IEMS is designed to: 1. 2. 3. Foster a full Federal, State, and local government partnership with provisions of flexibility for achieving common goals. Implementation of Emergency Management measures which are effective. Build on the foundation of existing emergency management plans, systems and capabilities to broaden their applicability to the full spectrum of emergencies.  The community will begin by developing emergency operating plans that are governed by a national criteria specific enough to provide guidance, but general enough to allow flexibility for communities. The process begins with: 1. 2. 3. A comprehensive hazard assessment prepared by the community. Identifying the shortfalls of resources. Development of a generic operations plan with annexes for the unique aspects of individual emergencies, maintenance capability, mitigation activities, emergency operations, and policy and guidance and technical and financial assistance.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 10 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   TYPES OF DISASTERS Disasters are identified as natural, technological, and civil. Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornados, or nor'easters that have an extreme impact on the community are NATURAL DISASTERS. Events that have a direct impact on the community but are caused by human omission or error are TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS. Deliberate human acts, such as riots or terrorist acts that cause harm are categorized as CIVIL DISASTERS. The North American continent is susceptible to numerous natural disasters every year. In New Jersey, a shoreline state, each year we focus on heavy rains, flooding, nor'easterns and hurricane threats. Flooding is the natural disaster from which we are most at risk. Although few injuries occur from floods, more deaths and property damage can be attributed to flooding than any other natural disaster. Here are some recent examples of how flooding affected the residents in New Jersey and the cost dollar figures of damages sustained.  NATURAL DISASTERS FLASH FLOODS - #1 Weather-related Killer in the United States! HOW DO FLASH FLOODS OCCUR? Several factors contribute to flash flooding. The two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play an important role. Flash floods occur within a few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall, a dam or levee failure, or a sudden release of water held by an ice jam. Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Rapidly rising water can reach heights of 30 feet or more. Furthermore, flash flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic mud slides. You will not always have a warning that these deadly, sudden floods are coming. Most flood deaths are due to flash floods. Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rains from hurricanes and tropical storms. Occasionally, floating debris or ice can accumulate at a natural or man-made obstruction and restrict the flow of water. Water held back by the ice jam or debris dam can cause flooding upstream. Subsequent flash flooding can occur downstream if the  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 11 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   obstruction should suddenly release. June 9, 1972 - Black Hills, Rapid City, Sd, 15 inches of rain in 5 hours, 238 fatalities, $164M in damages - Source: National Weather Service Even 6 inches of fast-moving flood water can knock you off your feet, and a depth of 2 feet will float your car! NEVER try to walk, swim, or drive through such swift water. If you come upon flood waters, STOP! TURN AROUND AND GO ANOTHER WAY.

Flash flooding occurs within 6 hours of the rain event. Flooding is a longer term event and may last a week or more. River Flood - Flooding along rivers is a natural and inevitable part of life. Some floods occur seasonally when winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, fill river  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 13 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   basins, with too much water, too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or tropical systems can also produce river flooding. Coastal Flood - Winds generated from tropical storms and hurricanes or intense offshore low pressure systems can drive ocean water inland and cause significant flooding. Escape routes can be cut off and blocked by high water. Coastal flooding can also be produced by sea waves called tsunamis, sometimes referred to as tidal waves. These waves are produced by earthquakes or volcanic activity. Urban Flood - As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses its ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanization increases runoff 2 to 6 times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements can become death traps as they fill with water. FLASH FLOODING IN ARROYOS/WASHES An arroyo is a water-carved gully or normally dry creek bed. Arroyos can fill with fastmoving water very quickly. Flash flooding at this arroyo in Arizona took only 58 seconds to develop. Ice Jam - Floating ice can accumulate at a natural or manmade obstruction and stop the flow of water. HOW CAN A FOOT OR TWO OF WATER COST YOU YOUR LIFE? Water weighs 62.4 lbs. per cubic foot and typically flows downstream at 6 to 12 miles an hour. When a vehicle stalls in the water, the water's momentum is transferred to the car. For each foot the water rises, 500 lbs. of lateral force are applied to the car. But the biggest factor is buoyancy. For each foot the water rises up the side of the car, the car displaces 1,500 lbs. of water. In effect, the car weighs 1,500 lbs. less for each foot the water rises. Two feet of water will carry away most automobiles. WHAT YOUR COMMUNITY CAN DO: Assist hospitals and other operations which are critically affected by power failure by arranging for auxiliary power supplies. River/rainfall readings are valuable to local emergency management agencies (EMA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) in assessing flood conditions and taking appropriate actions. WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 14 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   Advanced warning provided by early detection is critical to saving lives. Automatic flood detection systems are available commercially for flood-prone communities. Contact your local NWS office or emergency management agency for further information on Local flood warning systems. NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a tone-alert feature which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued. WHAT TO LISTEN FOR. . . Flash flood or flood watch: Flash flooding or flooding is possible within the designated watch area - be alert. Flash flood or flood warning: Flash flooding or flooding has been reported or is imminent - take necessary precautions at once. Urban and small stream advisory: Flooding of small streams, streets, and low-lying areas, such as railroad underpasses and urban storm drains, is occurring. Flash flood or flood statement:: Follow-up information regarding a flash flood/flood event. INFORMATION FOR THE PUBLIC ... C C C C Get out of areas subject to flooding. This includes dips, low spots, canyons, washes, etc. Avoid already flooded and high velocity flow areas. Do not attempt to cross flowing streams. If driving, be aware that the road bed may not be intact under flood waters. Turn around and go another way. NEVER drive through flooded roadways! If the vehicle stalls, leave it immediately and seek higher ground. Rapidly rising water may engulf the vehicle and its occupants and sweep them away. Remember, it's better to be wet than dead!  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 15 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   C C  Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood dangers. Do not camp or park your vehicle along streams and washes, particularly during threatening conditions.  DURING THE FLOOD: C C C Avoid areas subject to sudden flooding. If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, STOP! Turn around and go another way. Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. The depth of water is not always obvious. The road bed may be washed out under the water, and you could be stranded or trapped. Children should never play around high water, storm drains, viaducts, or arroyos.  C  AFTER THE FLOOD: C C C C C C C If fresh food has come in contact with flood waters, throw it out. Boil drinking water before using. Wells should be pumped out and the water tested for purity before drinking. If in doubt, call you local public health authority. Seek necessary medical care at the nearest hospital. Food, clothing, shelter, and first aid are available from the Red Cross. Do not visit disaster areas. Your presence might hamper rescue and other emergency operations. Electrical equipment should be checked and dried before being returned to service. Use flashlights, not lanterns, torches or matches, to examine buildings. Flammable materials may be inside. Report broken utility lines to appropriate authorities.  FAMILY DISASTER PLAN Families should be prepared for all hazards that affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge each family to develop a family disaster plan. Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere - at work, at WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 16 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disasters may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services - water, gas, electricity or telephones - were cut off? A DISASTER SUPPLIES KIT SHOULD INCLUDE: 1. 2. 3. 4. A 3-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that won't spoil One change of clothing and footwear per person One blanket or sleeping bag per person, a first aid kit, including prescription medicines Emergency tools, including a battery-powered NOAA Weather Radio and a portable radio, flashlight, and plenty of extra batteries an extra set of car keys and a credit card or cash.  THUNDERSTORMS Thunderstorms affect relatively small areas when compared with hurricanes and winter storms. The typical thunderstorm is 15 miles in diameter and lasts an average of 30 minutes. Nearly 1,800 thunderstorms are occurring at any moment around the world. That's 16 million a year! Despite their small size, all thunderstorms are dangerous. Every thunderstorm produces lightning, which kills more people each year than tornadoes. Heavy rain from thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding. Strong winds, hail, and tornadoes are also dangers associated with some thunderstorms. Of the estimated 100,000 thunderstorms that occur each year in the United States, only about 10 percent are classified as severe. Your National Weather Service considers a thunderstorm severe if it produces hail at least 3/4-inch in diameter, wind 58 mph or higher, or tornadoes. Lightning C C C Occurs with all thunderstorms. Averages 93 deaths and 300 injuries each year. Causes several hundred million dollars in damage to property and forests annually. UNIT 1  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 17 REVISED 10/01   Flash Floods/Floods C C The number one thunderstorm killer. . . nearly 140 fatalities each year. Most flash flood deaths occur at night and when people become trapped in automobiles.  Straight-line Winds C C C C Responsible for most thunderstorm wind damage. Winds can exceed 100 mph! One type of straight-line wind, the down burst, can cause damage equivalent to a strong tornado and can be extremely dangerous to aviation. During the summer in the western states, thunderstorms often produce little rain but very strong wind gusts and dust storms.  Large Hail C C Causes nearly $1 billion in damage to property and crops annually. Costliest United States hailstorm: Denver, Colorado, July 11, 1990. Total damage was $625 million.  Tornadoes C C C C Nature's most violent storms. Winds can exceed 200 mph. Result in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries each year. Most fatalities occur when people do not leave mobile homes and automobiles.  WHAT MAKES A THUNDERSTORM? 1. 2. 3. Moisture - to form clouds and rain. Unstable Air - relatively warm air that can rise rapidly. Lift - fronts, sea breezes, and mountains are capable of lifting air to help form thunderstorms.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 18 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   WHEN ARE THUNDERSTORMS MOST LIKELY? C Thunderstorms are most likely to happen in the spring and summer months and during the afternoon and evening hours but can occur year-round and at all hours. Along the Gulf Coast and across the southeastern and western states, most thunderstorms occur during the afternoon. Thunderstorms frequently occur in the late afternoon and at night in the Plains states. Thunder and lightning occasionally accompany snow or freezing rain. During the blizzard of March 1993, lightning resulted in power outages near Washington, D.C.!  C C C  THUNDERSTORM WINDS AND HAIL Down bursts C C C C C A small area of rapidly descending air beneath a thunderstorm. Can cause damaging winds in excess of 100 mph. The strong winds usually approach from one direction and may be known as ""straight-line"" winds. In extreme cases, straight-line winds can reach speeds equal to a strong tornado, causing significant damage to some buildings. Strong winds may or may not be accompanied by rain.  Large Hail C C C The strong rising currents of air within a storm, droplets to a height where freezing occurs. called updrafts, carry water  Ice particles grow in size, finally becoming too heavy to be supported by the updraft and fall to the ground. Large hailstones fall at speeds faster than 100 mph.  WHAT IS LIGHTNING? WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 19 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   C  The action of rising and descending air within a thunderstorm separates positive and negative charges. Water and ice particles also affect the distribution of electrical charge. Lightning results from the buildup and discharge of electrical energy between positively and negatively charges areas. The average flash could light a 100-watt light bulb for more than 3 months. Most lightning occurs within the cloud or between the cloud and ground. Your chances of being struck by lightning are estimated to be 1 in 600,000 but could be reduced by following safety rules. Most lightning deaths and injuries occur when people are caught outdoors. Most lightning casualties occur in the summer months and during the afternoon and early evening. The air near a lightning strike is heated to 50,000 F-hotter than the surface of the sun! The rapid heating and cooling of air near the lightning channel causes a shock wave that results in thunder. Many fires in the western United States and Alaska are started by lightning. In the past decade, over 15,000 lightning-induced fires nationwide have resulted in several hundred million dollars a year in damage and the loss of 2 million acres of forest. In recent years, sophisticated lightning detection equipment has monitored cloudto-ground lightning strikes.  C C C C C  C  C  C C  WHICH WAY DOES LIGHTNING TRAVEL? A cloud-to-ground lightning strike begins as an invisible channel of electrically charged air moving from the cloud toward the ground. When one channel nears an object on the ground, a powerful surge of electricity from the ground moves upward to the cloud and produces the visible lightning strike! LIGHTNING MYTHS AND FACTS MYTH: If it is not raining, then there is no danger from lightning.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 20 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   FACT: Lightning often strikes outside of heavy rain and may occur as far as 10 miles away from any rainfall. MYTH: The rubber soles of shoes or rubber tires on a car will protect you from being struck by lightning. rubber tires provide no protection from lightning. frame of a hard-topped vehicle provides increased not touching metal. Although you may be injured if car, you are much safer inside a vehicle than  FACT: Rubber-soled shoes and However, the steel protection if you are lightning strikes your outside. MYTH:  People struck by lightning carry an electrical charge and should not be touched.  FACT: Lightning-strike victims carry no electrical charge and should be attended to immediately. MYTH: ""Heat lightning"" occurs after very hot summer days and poses not threat.  FACT: What is referred to as ""heat lightning"" is actually lightning from a thunderstorm too far away for thunder to be heard. However, the storm may be moving in your direction! To estimate the distance in miles between you and the lightning flash, count the seconds between the lightning and the thunder and divide by five. ADVANCED WEATHER RADAR SEES ""INSIDE"" THE STORM Doppler Radars, which are being strategically deployed around the country, are capable of seeing ""inside"" a thunderstorm to detect hazardous weather conditions. Doppler radar images can reflect wind direction, precipitation intensity, and the leading edge of the storm's cool-air outflow. (New storms often form along this feature.) NOAA WEATHER RADIO IS THE BEST MEANS TO RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE The National Weather Service continuously broadcasts updated weather forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios, which are stores. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography. Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery tone-alert feature that automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 21 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1  warnings and sold in many Your National backup and a issued.   C  Tells you when and where severe thunderstorms are more likely to occur. Watch the sky and stay tuned to know when warnings are issued. Watches are intended to heighten public awareness and should not be confused with warnings.  SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WARNING C Issued when severe weather has been reported by spotters or indicated by radar. Warnings indicate imminent danger to life and property to those in the path of the storm.  FAMILY DISASTER PLAN Families should be prepared for all hazards that could affect their area. NOAA's National Weather Service, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the American Red Cross urge every family to develop a family disaster plan. Some questions to be considered? C C C C Where will your family be when disaster strikes? They could be anywhere-at work, at school, or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disaster may force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services-water, gas, electricity or telephones-were cut off?  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 22 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   TORNADOS Although tornadoes occur in many parts of the world, these destructive forces of nature are found most frequently in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during the spring and summer months. In an average year, 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide, resulting in 80 deaths and over 1,500 injuries. A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 mph or more. Damage paths can be in excess of one mile wide and 50 miles long. Once a tornado in Borken Bow, Oklahoma, carried a motel sign 30 miles and dropped it in Arkansas! WHAT CAUSES TORNADOES? Thunderstorms develop in warm, moist air in advance of eastward-moving cold fronts. These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. During the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a ""dryline,"" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours. Along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows ""up slope"" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes. Tornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore. TORNADO VARIATIONS Some tornadoes may form during the early stages of rapidly developing thunderstorms. This type of tornado is most common along the front range of the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, and the Western States. Tornadoes may appear nearly transparent until dust and debris are picked up. Occasionally, two or more tornadoes may occur at the same time.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 23 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   Waterspout Waterspouts are weak tornadoes that form over warm water. Waterspouts are most common along the Gulf Coast and southeastern states. In the western United States, they occur with cold late fall or late winter storms, during a time when you least expect tornado development. Waterspouts occasionally move inland becoming tornadoes causing damage and injuries. TORNADO MYTHS: MYTH: FACT: Areas near rivers, lakes, and mountains are safe from tornadoes. No place is safe from tornadoes. In the late 1980's, a tornado swept through Yellowstone National Park leaving a path of destruction up and down a 10,000 ft. mountain. The low pressure with a tornado causes buildings to ""explode"" as the tornado passes overhead. Violent winds and debris slamming into buildings cause most structural damage. Windows should be opened before a tornado approaches to equalize pressure and minimize damage. Opening windows allows damaging winds to enter the structure. Leave the windows alone; instead, immediately go to a safe place.  MYTH: FACT: MYTH: FACT:  Remember, tornadoes occasionally develop in areas in which a severe thunderstorm watch or warning is in effect. Remain alert to signs of an approaching tornado and seek shelter if threatening conditions exist. TORNADO SAFETY IN SCHOOLS C C C Every School Should Have A Plan. Develop a severe weather action plan and have frequent drills. Each school should be inspected and tornado shelter areas designated by a registered engineer or architect. Basements offer the best protection. Schools without basements should use interior rooms and hallways on the lowest floor and away from windows. Those responsible for activating the plan should monitor weather information from NOAA Weather Radio and local radio/television. UNIT 1  C  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 24 REVISED 10/01   C C C C  If the school's alarm system relies on electricity, have a compressed air horn or megaphone to activate the alarm in case of power failure. Make special provisions for disabled students and those in portable classrooms. Make sure someone knows how to turn off electricity and gas in the event the school is damaged. Keep children at school beyond regular hours if threatening weather is expected. Children are safer at school than in a bus or car. Students should not be sent home early if severe weather is approaching. Lunches or assemblies in large rooms should be delayed if severe weather is anticipated. Gymnasiums, cafeterias, and auditoriums offer no protection from tornado-strength winds. Move students quickly into interior rooms or hallways on the lowest floor. Have them assume the tornado protection positions.  C  C  Hospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions should develop a similar plan Your National Weather Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and American Red Cross educate community officials and the public concerning the dangers posed by tornadoes. You can prepare for the possibility of a tornado by learning the safest places to seek shelter when at home, work, school, or outdoors. You should also understand basic weather terms and danger signs related to tornadoes. Your chances of staying safe during a tornado are greater if you have a plan for you and your family, and practice the plan frequently. HURRICANES HURRICANES are masses of warm moist air rotating around in a low pressure area. These masses develop seasonally over the Atlantic and Caribbean. When they reach speeds of seventy-four miles per hour, they are called hurricanes. Hurricanes can easily change course, subjecting coastal areas to a tidal or storm surge whose effects are much like those of a flash flood. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 inflicted more than seven billion dollars damage on South Carolina. There are no other storms like hurricanes on earth. Views of hurricanes from satellites located thousands of miles above the earth show how unique these powerful, tightly coiled weather systems are.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 25 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1   Hurricanes are products of the tropical ocean and atmosphere. Powered by heat from the sea, they are steered by the easterly trade winds and the temperate westerlies as well as by their own ferocious energy. Around their core, winds grow with great velocity, generating violent seas. Moving ashore, they sweep the ocean inward while spawning tornadoes and producing torrential rains and floods. Each year on average, ten tropical storms (of which six become hurricanes) develop over the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, or Gulf of Mexico. Many of these remain over the ocean. However, about five hurricanes strike the United States coastline every 3 years. Of these five, two will be major hurricanes (category 3 or greater on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale). WHAT IS A HURRICANE? A Hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone--the general term for all circulating weather systems (counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) over tropical waters. Tropical cyclones are classified as follows: TROPICAL DEPRESSION - An organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with a defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 38 mph (33 knots) or less. TROPICAL STORM - An organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph (34-63 knots). HURRICANE - An intense tropical weather system with a well defined circulation and maximum sustained winds of 74 mph (64 knots) or higher. In the western Pacific, hurricanes are called ""typhoons,"" and similar storms in the Indian Ocean are called ""cyclones."" Timely warnings have greatly diminished hurricane fatalities in the United States. In spite of this, Property damages continues to mount. There is little we can do about the hurricanes themselves. However, NOAA'S National Hurricane Center and National Weather Service field offices team up with other Federal, state, and local agencies; rescue and relief organizations; the private sector; and the news media in a warning and preparedness effort. In the eastern Pacific, hurricanes begin forming by mid-May, while in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, hurricane development starts in June. For the United States, the peak hurricane threat exists from mid-August to late October although the official hurricane season extends through November. Developing hurricanes gather heat and energy through contact with warm ocean waters. The addition of moisture by evaporation from the sea surface powers them like giant heat engines. The process by which a disturbance forms and subsequently strengthens into a hurricane depends on at least three conditions. 1. 2. Warm waters Moisture UNIT 1  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 26 REVISED 10/01   3.  Wind patterns near the ocean surface.  Bands of thunderstorms form, allowing the air to further warm and rise higher into the atmosphere. If the winds at these higher levels are relatively light, this structure can remain intact and allow for additional strengthening. The center, or eye, of a hurricane is relatively calm. The most violent activity takes place in the area immediately around the eye, called the eye wall. At the top of the eye wall most of the air is propelled outward, increasing the air's upward motion. Some of the air moves inward and sinks into the eye, creating a cloud-free area. WHAT IS STORM SURGE? Storm surge is a large dome of water often 50 to 100 miles wide that sweeps coastline near where a hurricane makes landfall. The surge of high water waves is devastating. The stronger the hurricane and shallower the offshore higher the surge will be. Along the coast, storm surge is the greatest threat property.

The storm tide is a combination of the storm surge and the normal astronomical tide. INFORMATION OR LOCAL DECISION MAKERS THE PUBLIC ADVISORY issued by the National Hurricane Center provides critical hurricane warning and forecast information. THE MARINE ADVISORY issued by the National Hurricane Center provides detailed hurricane track and wind field information. THE TROPICAL CYCLONE UPDATE issued by the National Hurricane Center provides significant changes in a hurricane that occur between advisories. PROBABILITIES OF HURRICANE/TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS provide a measure of the forecast track accuracy. The probabilities have no relation to tropical cyclone intensity. HURRICANE LOCAL STATEMENTS issued by the local national weather service offices give greater detail on how the storm will impact your area. TECHNOLOGICAL DISASTERS Technological disasters, which may or may not involve hazardous materials, usually occur with little or no warning. They also may be insidious, and the victims may not know they have been affected until many years later. Although there are many types of technological disasters, the most common involve fires and explosions. Other kinds of disasters are; transportation accidents, i.e., airplane crashes, structural failures, i.e., building collapses, and rail and highway hazardous materials incidents. In 1968, Congress established the National Contingency Plan (NCP), to help bring federal agency expertise on incidents involving spills of oil and hazardous substances. The two primary legal authorities for the NCP are the Clean Water Act, which establishes a fund for federal response to oil spills; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which established the Superfund for federal responses to release of hazardous materials. In 1984, after the Bhopal, India disaster in which a cloud of deadly methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a Union Carbide chemical plant, killing more than 25,000 people and leaving tens of thousands injured, Congress enacted legislation mandating disaster planning wherever hazardous materials are in use. THE SUPERFUND AMENDMENT AND REAUTHORIZTION ACT (SARA) is designed to assist localities and its citizens in preparing for and responding to hazardous WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 28 REVISED 10/01 UNIT 1   materials incidents. Title III of SARA, also known as the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires detailed information about the nature of the hazardous substance in or near communities be made available to the public. CIVIL DISASTERS Civil disasters are civil disturbances, massacres, and other deliberately destructive human actions that impact our communities. The results that occur are usually widespread illnesses, injuries , destruction of property and long-term social and economic disruption. Terrorism is a civil incident with the potential to lead to civil disaster. Highly destructive weapons and political unrest have made terrorism of particular concern in the United States. Here are some examples of terrorist activities in the United States: The FBI has recorded one act of terrorism, one suspected act of terrorism, and two terrorism preventions on U.S. soil in 1995. Terrorism related events--including terrorism trials--occurred in eight states. The most significant terrorist-related events include the following: FEB 26,1993, A car bomb at the World Trade Center in New York City exploded, killing 6 people, injuring thousands and causing extensive damage. FEB. 28, 1995, (4) members of a domestic extremist group violating the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989. The subjects manufactured the biological agent RICIN with the intent to kill law enforcement officers. APRIL 19,1995, A truck bomb destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 citizens and injuring hundreds. It was the deadliest terrorist event on US soil. OCTOBER 9, 1995, A 12 car Amtrak train derailment in Arizona. The derailment killed one (1) person and seriously injured (12) others. Suspected act is still under investigation. NOVEMBER 11, 1995, FBI prevented an act of terrorism by arresting four US (4) persons in Oklahoma for illegally conspiring to manufacture and possess a destructive device. The subjects were considering attacking civil rights offices, abortion clinics, and federal offices.  WORKSHOP IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT - 29 REVISED 10/01  UNIT 1"

All six crewmembers abandoned the Scandia amid 10-foot waves and 25-knot winds; however, no one was injured. The crew was unsuccessful in its attempts to release the anchor of the barge, which ran aground and spilled 828,000 gallons of home heating oil, causing the largest pollution incident in Rhode Island's history, an incident that led to the closing of local fisheries. The safety issues discussed in this report are the origin of the fire, the company management's oversight of vessel maintenance, risk assessment of oil transportation by towed barges, search and rescue, and environmental pollution and cleanup. As a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard, Eklof Marine Corporation, and the American Waterways Operators, Inc.  The National Transportation Safety Board is an independent Federal agency dedicated to promoting aviation, railroad, highway, marine, pipeline, and hazardous materials safety. Established in 1967, the agency is mandated by Congress through the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974 to investigate transportation accidents, determine the probable causes of the accidents, issue safety recommendations, study transportation safety issues, and evaluate the safety effectiveness of government agencies involved in transportation. The Safety Board makes public its actions and decisions through accident reports, safety studies, special investigation reports, safety recommendations, and statistical reviews.

All six crewmembers abandoned the Scandia amid 10-foot waves and 25knot winds; however, no one was injured. The crew was unsuccessful in its attempts to release the anchor of the barge, which ran aground and spilled 828,000 gallons of home heating oil, causing the largest pollution incident in Rhode Island's history, an incident that led to the closing of local fisheries. The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the fire damage aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of and pollution from the barge North Cape was the Eklof Marine Corporation's inadequate oversight of maintenance and operations aboard those vessels, which permitted a fire of unknown origin to become catastrophic and eliminated any realistic possibility of arresting the subsequent drift and grounding of the barge. Contributing to the accident was the lack of adequate U.S. Coast Guard and industry standards addressing towing vessel safety. In its investigation, the Safety Board identified the following safety issues: 1. 2. 3. Origin and cause of fire. Company oversight of vessel maintenance. Risk assessment: Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels. 4. Search and rescue: Deployment of Coast Guard rescue boat. Hypothermia protective clothing. Decision to return to barge to drop its anchor. 5. Environmental pollution and cleanup.  As a result of its investigation of this accident, the Safety Board makes recommendations to the U.S. Coast Guard, the Eklof Marine Corporation, and the American Waterways Operators, Inc.   this page intentionally left blank   1  Factual Information  The Accident Fire About 5:45 p.m. on Thursday, January 18, 1996, the tug Scandia departed Bayonne, New Jersey, en route to Providence, Rhode Island, through Long Island Sound. (See figure 1.) The Scandia was pushing an unmanned barge, the North Cape, that was loaded with 4,074,000 gallons of home heating oil. The tug had six crewmen on board: a captain, a mate, a chief engineer, two tankermen, and a dayman. After from pushing steel towing afternoon the the tug left New York Harbor and entered Long Island Sound, it switched to towing the North Cape. The tug towed it at 7.5 knots, using a 1,600-foot hawser. The captain stated that he expected to reach Providence by early following day.  About 1 1/2 hours after the departure, the captain requested and received a faxed weather forecast from FleetWeather Ocean Services, Inc., (FleetWeather).1 2 According to the forecast, when the Scandia reached Long Island Sound later that evening, it would face 3- to 6-foot seas and 15- to 25-knot winds, and it would face 4- to 8-foot seas in Block Island Sound the next day. Just before noon on Friday, according to the captain, the visibility began to diminish because of fog. The Scandia was nearing Watch Hill on the Rhode Island coast. At noon, according to the usual watchstanding schedule, the mate assumed the navigation watch from the captain. About the time the mate assumed the watch, the chief engineer engineroom watch and went to his cabin. He stated that nothing unusual during his 6-hour watch and that all equipment had functioned properly. p.m., the on-watch tankerman completed his brief, hourly walking engineroom3 and went to the pilothouse. He said he had found everything to the engineroom. finished his had occurred About 12:30 tour of the be in order in  1 2 3  See last page of this document for a list of all acronyms and abbreviations used in this report.  A commercial organization that provides weather forecasts on demand to subscribers. The forecast faxed to the Scandia spanned the period from Thursday, January 18, to Sunday, January 21. The main deck of the Scandia inside the engineroom was called the fidley deck; the engineroom space above it was called the fidley, and the space below was the lower engineroom, where the propulsion engine was located. The fidley deck consisted of a steel grating over the engine, surrounded by steel deck plating.   Factual Information 2  Figure 1. Route of the Scandia   Factual Information  3  About 1 p.m., while the tankerman remained on the bridge, the mate said he went to the galley, which was adjacent to the fidley, for a drink of water. He said he entered the fidley and looked down through the grating to the lower engineroom, because it was his normal practice to check the fidley and lower engineroom when he was near them. He noticed nothing unusual and returned to the wheelhouse. Approximately 1:20 p.m., the dayman4 was standing in the galley and saw smoke coming from the top of the closed door between the fidley and the galley. He ran to the wheelhouse and told the mate and the tankerman about the smoke. Meanwhile, the wheelhouse fire-alarm siren had activated, and the vessel monitoring system panel started indicating Fire in Upper Engineroom (fidley). The mate sounded the general fire alarm to alert the rest of the crew, and the on-watch tankerman ran from the wheelhouse to the accommodations and woke the captain, who immediately went to the wheelhouse and took command. According to the captain, the bridge equipment was functioning properly. He also stated that the weather was worsening and the seas were 8 to 10 feet. He said he had navigated the Scandia in similar seas and that the conditions were within the vessel's operating ability. The chief engineer said he awoke in his cabin at the sound of the general alarm and smelled smoke. He left his cabin, which adjoined the galley and fidley, and opened the fidley door. He said there were a number of small fires scattered on the grating, mainly on the center of the grating above the main engine, and that there were also some scattered fires on the port side of the grating. He stated that there was no fire in the lower engineroom. The dayman brought a portable carbon dioxide (CO2) fire extinguisher to the chief engineer, who sprayed the contents through the open fidley door on the fire. Both the dayman and the mate, who arrived in the galley soon after, stated that the fire was on the grating and that they did not see flames in the lower engineroom. The intensity of the heat and smoke prevented the chief engineer and dayman from entering the fidley. They discharged the contents of two more portable CO2 extinguishers on the fire but were unable to control it. The pull ring, or control, for the engineroom's semi-portable CO2 fire extinguisher system was inside the fidley, about 6 feet from the door. The chief engineer said that the heat and smoke prevented him from entering the fidley to reach the pull ring. He said he also could not reach the fire pump, which was in the lower engineroom. He said the intense heat and smoke made him feel helpless in fighting the fire because he did not have a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) or a fireman's outfit. (Neither the Coast Guard nor the company required the Scandia to carry fireman's outfits or SCBAs.) The tankerman stated that the heat and thick smoke prevented him from closing the ventilation louvers on the engineroom stack (the louvers allowed air to enter the engineroom and feed the fire). The remote controls for the fans that ventilated the 4  The dayman's duties were cooking, cleaning, and helping moor the vessel.   Factual Information  4  engineroom were on the vessel's exterior, outside the fidley's aft door, near the towing winch drum; however, no crewmembers attempted to stop the fans. Meanwhile, a wooden cabinet fell over and blocked the fidley door to the galley. (The cabinet held engine spare parts and normally stood in the fidley against the forward port-side longitudinal bulkhead.) Consequently, the fidley door could not be closed, and smoke from the fidley entered the galley and flowed to other areas of the vessel. Because the rapidly increasing amount of smoke made breathing difficult, the captain told the mate to have the crewmembers retrieve their survival suits and muster on the bow. (The Scandia carried eight survival suits, and the cabins and watch locations were equipped with personal flotation devices.) About 1:57 p.m., the captain broadcast a PAN PAN5 on VHF radio channel 16 and told the Coast Guard Station Point Judith (the station) and Group Woods Hole that he had an uncontrolled fire on his vessel. (He also identified the Scandia's position from the vessel's global positioning system as latitude 41.18 N and longitude 71.32 W and described his location as being off No. 2 buoy, Point Judith.) He further informed the Coast Guard that there were six crewmen on board and that all intended to abandon ship. After making the broadcast, the captain donned his survival suit and went to the vessel's bow, where the rest of the crew had assembled. The crewmembers later said that while they waited on the bow, the tug's propulsion engine and the starboard generator, which powered the interior and exterior deck lighting, were still operating. Three commercial fishing vessels that were in the area, the Seafarer, the Huntress, and the Nautilus, had monitored the PAN PAN transmission. The Seafarer was closest to the Scandia. Its captain informed the Coast Guard that he was within 1.5 miles of the Scandia and proceeding toward it. About 2:02 p.m., a 41-foot utility boat (UTB) left the station. The station and the tug were about 4.5 miles apart. The boat's coxswain stated that before leaving he had not checked the latest weather information posted at the station but had observed the weather from the station window. After going a short distance, however, he realized that the wind and waves were too severe for the UTB. He returned to the station, and he and his crew transferred to a 44-foot motor life boat (MLB).6 About 2:23 p.m., the MLB left the station. About the same time, Group Woods Hole directed the 82-foot Coast Guard patrol boat Point Turner to proceed from Newport, Rhode Island, to the Scandia. Approximately 2:30 p.m., the Seafarer arrived on scene, and its captain radioed the Coast Guard that he could see six crewmen wearing survival suits and personal flotation devices on the bow of the tug, which was burning and smoking. The roughness of the sea prevented the Seafarer from approaching the tug without risking damage to its A radio broadcast indicating that the calling station has a very urgent message to transmit concerning the safety of a ship or person. The 41-foot UTB can operate safely in seas up to 8 feet and winds up to 30 knots; whereas the 44-foot MLB can operate safely in seas up to 30 feet and winds up to 50 knots. The UTB's maximum speed is 26 knots; the MLB's maximum speed is 13 knots. 6 5   Factual Information  5  extended outrigger arms. (The arms were extended over its sides to provide stability in rough seas.) About 2:55 p.m., the MLB arrived on scene. As the person in charge of the first Coast Guard resource to reach the scene, the coxswain assumed the role of on-scene commander.7 He observed that visibility was severely restricted by the thick fog and smoke. After the coxswain maneuvered the MLB in front of the tug, the chief engineer of the tug jumped onto the MLB. The pilothouse windows then suddenly blew out as if there had been an explosion. The coxswain said that when the ""explosion"" occurred and he saw flames come out of the pilothouse windows, he told the remaining crewmembers on the Scandia to hold hands and jump into the water. The coxswain then directed the surface swimmer on the MLB to jump in and retrieve the tug crewmembers. The swimmer was not wearing any thermal protection other than his anti-exposure coveralls. The temperature of the water was about 32 F. Wearing a rescue harness and tethered to the MLB, the swimmer encircled the crewmen in the water with his tether line and brought them alongside the MLB. The other MLB crewmen lifted them aboard. By 3:13 p.m., everyone had been retrieved from the water. While the MLB's crewmembers were assessing the physical condition of the tug crewmen, the captain of the Scandia asked the coxswain to take him to the barge so that he could board it and drop its anchor to prevent the barge from drifting ashore. But by then, the crew had discovered that the swimmer was hypothermic; consequently, the coxswain immediately returned to the station so the swimmer could have medical treatment. While the tug crewmen were being rescued, a Coast Guard helicopter had arrived and monitored the rescue. The coxswain later stated that given the rough sea, the poor visibility, and the smoke, the helicopter would not have been able to rescue the crew from the tug or hoist the swimmer from the MLB. At 3:35 p.m., the MLB arrived safely at the station. The swimmer was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and released.  Attempt to Deploy North Cape's Anchor When they arrived at the station, the chief engineer and the mate of the Scandia asked the coxswain to return them to the barge so that they could drop its anchor. The As acted as reported salvage, 7  on-scene commander, he reported to the commander of Coast Guard Group Woods Hole, who the search and rescue (SAR) mission coordinator for this accident. The mission coordinator to the First Coast Guard District Office in Boston, Massachusetts. For SAR operations that involve the mission coordinator is required to obtain formal approval for salvage from the District.   Factual Information  6  coxswain and the officer in charge of the station discussed the request and conveyed the information to the group commander at Group Woods Hole. Meanwhile, Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod (the air station) told the group commander that the air station would not provide a helicopter to deliver anyone to the barge because the risk associated with dropping the barge's anchor did not meet the aviation risk assessment guidelines in the Coast Guard's Air Operations Manual.8 The Coast Guard's First District search and rescue (SAR) plan did not have similar restrictions or risk assessment guidelines for the group commander to use in evaluating the risks the mission posed to surface craft. The general Coast Guard salvage policy for the group commander did not specify the conditions under which Coast Guard and civilian personnel could be placed at risk for salvage operations. The group commander said that he decided to let the coxswain take the tug crewmen to the barge because he thought that the mission was reasonably likely to succeed. He stated that he based his decision on the following factors: the operator of the barge had assured him that the crew had the knowledge and experience to drop the anchor, the coxswain had agreed to deliver the crewmen to the barge, and the crewmen were confident that they could drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. The group commander did not include the air station in his decisionmaking process and did not tell the air station that he had authorized the coxswain to return to the scene. About 4 p.m., the coxswain and two other crewmen left the station in the MLB with the chief engineer and the mate of the Scandia, both of whom were wearing survival suits. The MLB reached the barge about 4:45 p.m., and the two tug crewmen boarded it at 4:56 p.m. The barge was still drifting toward the Rhode Island shore and was less than 2 miles offshore. The crewmen repeatedly attempted to release the anchor but failed. They stated that rain, fog, and smoke from the burning tug had reduced visibility and that waves breaking over the barge's deck made their task increasingly difficult and dangerous. The coxswain motioned to the crewmen to re-board the MLB when it became clear to him that the anchor could not be released; he said he feared that the MLB might capsize in the high surf as the vessels drifted into progressively shallower water. About 5:35 p.m., the chief engineer jumped from the barge to the MLB. The mate remained on the barge; he stated that he did not jump because he was afraid of landing on top of the chief engineer. The coxswain said that he did not tell the mate to escape by jumping into the water because the surf was so rough that the mate might have been swept away or run over by the MLB. The coxswain failed at several attempts to rescue the mate by 8  The guidelines prohibit a Coast Guard helicopter and crew from being placed at risk lives are in danger, the mission has a reasonable chance of success, and no other alternatives the guidelines state that risk of damage to an aircraft is not acceptable unless the value of the saved is greater than the cost of damage to the aircraft, and the aircraft is expected to be fully  unless human exist.

According to the coxswain, the surf was too rough for safe maneuvering, and the MLB was in danger of running aground. About 5:47 p.m., the coxswain radioed the station and asked that the air station dispatch a helicopter to rescue the mate. The coxswain then left, believing there was nothing more he could do without endangering his own crew. The barge grounded about 6 p.m. on the rocks of Nebraska Shoal, off Moonstone Beach, releasing about 828,000 gallons of oil. At 6:10 p.m., a second MLB was dispatched from Coast Guard Station Castle Hill in Newport, Rhode Island; it was to wait at the accident scene until the helicopter arrived. The MLB arrived on scene at 7:28 p.m. but could not get close to the grounded barge because of the dangerously high surf. At 7:11 p.m., the helicopter left the air station. (The pilot stated that because of the approaching storm he had been forced to wait more than an hour before taking off. He said that he had needed the time to check the weather, plan a safe flight route, and file an instrument flight rules flight plan with the Federal Aviation Administration. He was waiting for the front to come through and did not want to be on scene when it did.) At 7:54 p.m., the helicopter arrived on scene. The pilot said that the mate was holding on to an A-frame on the deck of the barge in order to keep himself from being washed overboard by the large waves that repeatedly crashed over the deck. The pilot lowered a rescue swimmer to the deck; the swimmer wrapped a belt around the mate, who was uninjured, and both men were safely hoisted to the helicopter. It departed the scene about 8:15 p.m. and arrived at Providence Airport at 8:50 p.m. About 8:30 p.m., the tug grounded. The towline between the two vessels was still intact.  Injuries The swimmer was treated for hypothermia and released. No one else was injured.  Damage The Scandia grounded on Moonstone Beach in South Kingston, Rhode Island. Nearly all of the tug's combustible interior, from the fidley grating upward through the galley, crew accommodations, and wheelhouse, was consumed by fire. The fire destroyed the navigation and communication systems and equipment. The damage to the tug was estimated to be $1.5 million. The grounding tore open 11 of the North Cape's 14 cargo tanks. Estimated structural damage to the barge was $3.6 million.   Factual Information  8  This accident resulted in Rhode Island's largest9 oil spill and severely affected the local fishing industry in the short term and threatened local beaches and the habitats of marine life and birds. Rhode Island's fishing industry employs about 35,000 people and generates about $500 million a year. Much of the catch of lobsters, crabs, and fish was embargoed by Health Department officials to keep oil-contaminated seafood away from consumers. The governor of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency so that Federal funding could be used to compensate fishermen and others whose businesses and livelihoods were affected by the oil spill. The Eklof Marine Corporation (EMC) hired salvage and environmental cleanup contractors to use deflection and oil-containment booms to help keep the oil away from pristine areas. The rough weather moved the booms from their intended locations and allowed oil to seep into environmentally sensitive ponds and fisheries. The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM), the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed teams to study the effects of the oil on the fisheries and seabirds. According to NOAA's estimates, the oil killed millions of lobsters, harmed over a million pounds of shellfish, and affected thousands of pounds of fish in Block Island Sound and Rhode Island salt ponds. Thousands of seabirds and fish, such as flounder, tautog, and herring, washed ashore following the spill. Study teams estimated that it would take 1 to 5 years, depending on the species, for the affected fish and bird populations to return to the levels they had reached before the accident. Federal and State officials are using these studies to develop detailed plans for restoring the natural resources. NOAA used computers to calculate the trajectories of the oil and the effects of currents and weather on the dissipation of the oil. The calculations and field samples showed that within a week of the spill, the level of petroleum hydrocarbons in the water had fallen below the level considered toxic to shellfish and lobsters. NOAA estimated that the economic impact on human (public) use of the beachfront was minor. (Public use includes boat-based fishing, recreational diving, charter and party boat operations, beach use, and tourism.) However, the total scope of the environmental damage is still being assessed. Potential claims from the State of Rhode Island related to the natural resource damage are estimated to be $45 million.  Before this accident, the largest marine pollution incident in Rhode Island was the one that occurred in June 1989, in which the 560-foot-long tank ship World Prodigy ran aground on Brenton Reef, off Newport, spilling 200,000 gallons of home heating oil into Narragansett Bay. The spill was successfully cleaned up with minimal environmental damage. In comparison, the grounding of the Exxon Valdez in March 1989 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilled about 10,836,000 gallons of oil, resulting in catastrophic damage to the environment.  9   Factual Information  9  Crew Information Crew Requirements Under 46 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 15.610, the captain of the Scandia had to be licensed by the Coast Guard and could not work more than 12 hours in a 24hour period. Because the Scandia operated round the clock, Coast Guard regulations required it to have a second licensed deck officer, a mate. When the Scandia was being operated but was not towing a barge, it did not have to carry a tankerman, a dayman, or a chief engineer. The North Cape was unmanned, and its certificate of inspection required two tankermen for loading and unloading the cargo. The entire Scandia crew met the Coast Guard's requirements for training and qualifications.  Captain The captain was licensed as a mate for coastal vessels under 500 gross tons with a radar observer endorsement; thus, his license exceeded the one he was required to have in order to operate towing vessels like the Scandia. He had completed the following CoastGuard-approved courses: basic and advanced firefighting (in October 1994) and survival at sea. His marine experience consisted of 14 years Company, where he had progressed from deckhand of the accident, the EMC had employed him for mo Scandia on several nonconsecutive occasions for a of the vessel since September 1995. with the McAllister Brothers Towing through mate to captain. At the time re than 7 years. He had served on the total of 2 years. He had been captain  On January 18, he said he slept for about 5 hours (12:30 a.m. to 5:30 a.m.). He worked the 6-a.m.-to-noon shift, then took a nap before the fire started.  Mate The mate had a license for coastal vessels under 500 gross tons with a radar observer endorsement; he also had a tankerman's certificate. He stated that he had participated in drills aboard the Scandia. He had not taken any courses in firefighting or survival. He said he had worked in the marine industry for 17 years, starting on river towboats that pushed tank barges on the inland waterways. Then, he worked on offshore vessels in the oil industry in Louisiana, where he worked as tankerman, mate, chief mate, and captain.   Factual Information  10  The EMC had employed him for about 4 1/2 years. For the first year he had served as tankerman, the remaining time as mate on various EMC vessels. He had served as the mate of the Scandia since December 1994. On the day of the accident, he said he had slept for about 5 1/2 hours before he started his watch at noon.  Chief Engineer The chief engineer had a marine engineer's license for motor vessels of unlimited horsepower operating on limited oceans routes. He had 13 years of marine experience. He had been in the offshore supply-vessel industry as an oiler, assistant engineer, and chief engineer. Before joining the EMC, he had worked as chief engineer for 3 1/2 years on offshore supply vessels for Tidewater Marine. The EMC had hired him about 69 days before the accident, and he had spent the time as chief engineer of the Scandia. He said that he had participated in fire drills, and that ""we try to have a fire drill once every 2 weeks."" Coast Guard regulations require all licensed engineers, regardless of the vessel's gross tonnage or horsepower, to take firefighting training. The chief engineer had completed Coast-Guard-approved courses in basic and advanced firefighting about 4 years before the accident. He had been trained in using portable fire extinguishers, firefighting foam, fire hose teams, breathing apparatus, and fireman's outfits. He had also taken cold-water survival training while he was employed by a previous employer. Coast Guard regulations do not require uninspected towing vessels (UTVs)10 or unmanned barges to have a licensed engineer on board. The EMC had provided the engineer to operate the pumps on the barge when the cargo was being loaded or unloaded and to perform routine maintenance on the tug. The chief engineer was on watch from 6 p.m. until midnight on Thursday. That night he slept for about 5 hours, and then worked his 6-a.m.-to-noon shift in the engineroom on the day of the fire.  Dayman The dayman held a merchant mariner's document (MMD) endorsed as an ablebodied seaman (AB). He had obtained his maritime training over a 7-year period at the Naval Institute and Marine College, Russia. He had spent the next 7 years at sea, 5 as third mate and 2 as second mate, on Russian fishing trawlers. As a mate, he had attended a week-long firefighting school each year.  Towing vessels are uninspected, unless the vessel admeasures over 300 gross tons and is oceangoing. According to Coast Guard statistics, all but 10 of the 5,216 towing vessels in the United States are uninspected.  10   Factual Information  11  The EMC had hired him about 6 weeks before the accident, and his responsibilities included cooking and cleaning the galley and accommodations. He also helped moor the barge and tug. The accident trip was his first trip on the Scandia. He stated that when he boarded the tug, the captain told him what his duties were and how to use the survival suit. He stated that he did not know how to operate the semi-portable CO2 system that protected the engineroom. The dayman said he worked from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on the vessel on January 18 and then relaxed on board. He said that he went to bed that night at 11 p.m. and awoke at 7 a.m. on January 19.  Tankerman 1 The tankerman held an MMD endorsed as an AB. He had taken a course in loading and discharging tank vessels and had a tankerman rating. He stated that he had had no training in either firefighting or lifesaving. However, he correctly described to Safety Board investigators how to operate the CO2 system in the fidley. He said his last emergency drill on the Scandia was an abandon-ship drill, which was held about a month before the accident. He had worked as tankerman for 7 of the 10 years that he had worked in the marine industry. He had worked for the EMC as a tankerman for nearly 5 1/2 years and had served on the Scandia for about a year. Before joining the EMC, he had been employed by two other towing companies. He said he had slept about 5 1/2 hours (6 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.) before starting his shift at noon on the day of the accident.  Tankerman 2 The tankerman held an MMD endorsed as an AB and worked as the second tankerman, the steward, and the wiper on the Scandia. His 11 years in the marine industry included 9 as a tankerman and 2 as a deckhand. The EMC had employed him for over 4 years, and he had served on the Scandia for a little over a year. He had worked with the North Cape for about 4 years. He did not have firefighting training; none was required by regulations. He stated that he had last participated in a firefighting drill just over a month before the accident. The tankerman was on watch from 6 p.m. to midnight on January 18. After that, he said, he had slept for about 5 1/2 hours before starting his watch at 6 a.m.   Factual Information  12  Vessel Information Scandia The oceangoing towing vessel was 111.5 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 10.5 feet deep. It was operated by the EMC (see figures 2, 3, and 4). It was built in 1968 and admeasured 198 gross tons. It was documented by the Coast Guard to operate on coastwise and foreign voyages. Engineroom. The main deck of the Scandia continued inside the engineroom, where it was called the ""fidley deck""; the space above the deck was called the ""fidley,"" and the space below was called the ""lower engineroom."" The Scandia's 3,600-horsepower propulsion diesel engine was situated longitudinally on the tug's centerline in the lower engineroom. The engine's exhaust manifold pipe, 10 inches in diameter and thermally insulated, ran on top of the engine, 7 inches below the fidley deck grating. The temperature of the manifold, under the insulation blanket, was about 950o F under normal operating conditions. An exhaust gas turbocharger was attached to the aft end of the engine's exhaust manifold; the turbocharger was about 15 feet aft of the center of the fidley deck grating and just below it. The aft end of the turbocharger connected to a rubber pipe that formed a vibration connection to the plenum that drew fresh outside air into the engine. The company's port engineer estimated that the fidley deck grating was about 135o F under normal operating conditions. The holes in the fidley deck grating allowed air to move up from the lower engineroom to the fidley, where an exhaust fan in the stack vented the air to the outside. Two ventilation fans drew outside air into the lower engineroom. Two diesel generators, one on each side of the main engine, provided the vessel's electrical power. An oil-fired boiler (for hot water and heat) was in the aft starboard corner. All fuel and lube oil system components for the Scandia, including tanks, piping, valves, pumps, motors, and controls, were in the lower engineroom. The forward end of the lower engineroom had a workshop, including a wooden worktable. The Scandia's fire pump was in the lower engineroom; the pump was operated by the engine for the starboard generator via a power take-off clutch. To operate the pump, a crewmember had to come down from the fidley, using either the port or starboard stairway, open sea water valves to the pump, and engage the clutch. The pump could not be started from outside the engineroom. Fidley.

The cabinets contained machinery spare parts and were attached to the bulkhead. The vessel's electrical distribution systems, switchboards, and transformers were in the fidley. A watertight steel door at the aft end of the fidley led to the exterior of the main deck aft, where the winch for towing barges was. Emergency remote controls for shutting off fuel pumps to the propulsion and generator engines were on a bulkhead just outside the fidley's aft door, along with remote controls for closing the valves from the fuel tanks. Also located here were the control switches for the engineroom ventilation supply fans and exhaust fans. Crew Accommodations.

Above the the captain and the mate. The accommodations were made of  The Scandia was a UTV. UTVs are required to comply with regulations at 46 CFR Subchapter C, Part 25, which the Scandia did. These regulations required the Scandia to have at least three 15-pound portable fire extinguishers, lifesaving equipment, emergency position indicating radar beacons, and engineroom ventilation systems. In addition to meeting these requirements, the Scandia also had a semi-portable CO2 fire extinguishing system, additional portable fire extinguishers, a fire pump, and remote closing devices for fuel pumps, valves, and ventilation fans. (The regulations do not require vessels such as the Scandia to have remotely operated fixed fire extinguishing systems in the engineroom, remotely operated fire pumps, SCBAs, or firesuits. The Scandia was not equipped with these items.) The Coast Guard does not require UTVs to be classed by ship classification societies such as the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). However, the EMC kept the Scandia in ABS class as Towing Vessel for Ocean Service. ABS surveyors carried out annual hull and machinery surveys11 and dry dockings at 24- to 30-month intervals. Safety Board investigators reviewed the ABS survey records from January 1992 to April 1995, when the last survey before the fire was done. The ABS reported the overall condition of the Scandia to be satisfactory12 during this period. As a condition of maintaining ABS class, the ABS requires the vessel owner or operator to tell ABS Surveys are visual and operational examinations of selected mechanical and electrical equipment and systems and include the visual and ultrasonic examination of the hull plating and structure. In ABS survey reports, a vessel condition (machinery, electrical, material) is noted as ""Satisfactory"" or ""Un-satisfactory."" This comment is used to indicate whether the equipment met or failed to meet the operational or material requirements in an ABS survey. 12 11   Factual Information  17  surveyors about any significant problems on a vessel that may affect its classification. The EMC did not report any such problems to the ABS during this period. According to the ABS, machinery classification surveys are typically conducted with the vessel in port, when the main engine is not running. According to ABS rules, a survey is a spot check of a vessel's condition at a point in time and is not intended to provide a continuous evaluation of the vessel, and the ABS is not responsible for the maintenance of the vessel. North Cape The single-hulled barge North Cape was 340 feet long, 70 feet wide, and 27.8 feet deep. It was built in 1978 and admeasured 5,506 gross tons. The North Cape had a centerline longitudinal bulkhead and transverse bulkheads that divided the cargo block into seven pairs of port and starboard tanks; the vessel's total cargo capacity was 4.2 million gallons (100,000 barrels). For loading and unloading the cargo, the barge had a cargo pumproom on the deck forward and two pumprooms on deck aft. The Coast Guard had issued a certificate of inspection for the North Cape for unmanned operation on coastwise and ocean routes and for the carriage of Grade A and lower grades of oil. The North Cape was also classed with the ABS as an oil barge. The Coast Guard does not require unmanned barges to have anchors and windlasses, as no crewmembers are normally on board to operate them. (Manned barges are required to have anchors.) Nor does the ABS require such equipment as a condition of classification. The North Cape, however, had a 6,000-pound bow anchor. On the day of the accident, it was temporarily held in place on the bow anchor sled by a wire rope sling and shackle attached to an A-frame just behind the sled. The temporary arrangement was used while the windlass and its brake--which normally secured the anchor--were being repaired ashore. The North Cape was equipped with the anchor and windlass for operational convenience, according to the EMC; the vessel's logbook showed that it had often anchored while waiting for access to an oil terminal or for traffic to clear in a congested waterway. The mate stated that he had secured the anchor in the temporary fashion just before starting the trip and that the anchor had been similarly secured before when the windlass was being repaired.  Company Information The Scandia and the North Cape were operated by the EMC, Staten Island, New York. The EMC operated 42 vessels, including 22 tank barges, 12 tugs, 2 integrated tug/barges, and 6 tank ships. The vessels operated along the East Coast, on the inland waterways, in the Gulf of Mexico, and on Central and South American waters. The company had about 50 employees on shore and 225 employees on vessels.   Factual Information  18  The EMC's management consisted of a president, a vice president, an operations (and safety) manager, a port captain, and three port engineers. The EMC's 10-acre Staten Island facility included a full marine repair yard that consisted of a machine shop, an electric shop, a welding shop, and a safety and training building. The EMC did most of its vessel repairs in its yard using EMC personnel. (In February 1998, the president of the EMC told the Safety Board that the EMC had changed its corporate policy after this accident, when the EMC began contracting for all repair work.)  EMC's Vessel Maintenance Program In January 1996, the EMC gave the Safety Board investigators its Operation Notice 17-93, which briefly described the way in which the company's vessel inspection program (VIP) was intended to function. According to the document, the program was administered by the EMC's operations manager and was aimed at detecting and correcting unsafe shipboard conditions and practices which, if left undetected, could lead to accidents. The VIP required captains to inspect their vessels once a month, to ensure that their crews completed the repairs and maintenance within their capability, and to complete monthly discrepancy reports for their vessels and forward them to the operations department. The operations department was responsible for reviewing the discrepancy reports and for correcting problems, by directing either company repair personnel or subcontractors to do repairs at the EMC's repair yard. According to Operation Notice 17-93, serious safety discrepancies were to be corrected within about 2 weeks.  Maintenance of Scandia The Safety Board reviewed the Scandia's discrepancy reports for 1994 and 1995. One particular discrepancy was reported by captains as many as nine times between May 1994 and July 1995 and was characterized by them as a ""fire hazard."" The problem was described in a handwritten attachment to the June 1995 discrepancy report: The turbocharger is leaking oil in a bad way, it was looked at when we was in the yard for fire repairs,13 but nothing was done to it to correct the problem. The smoke is so bad that if we don't open the watertight door at the rear of the engineroom, the smoke forces the smoke in the galley and the rest of the tug. Oil comes out of the turbo and soaks the blanket and down on top of the engine and burns off. I've had complaints of headaches from the crew, irritated and sickening smell, all watertight doors should be closed underway, the amount of smoke coming out of the back door of the engineroom is always pointed out by other tugs as we pass them like there is a real problem in the engineroom. Chief [engineer] says it has flashed The writer is referring to the engineroom fire on March 1995, which is described in this section of the report. 13   Factual Information  19  and caught fire once before, He put it out with a CO2 extinguisher.... [footnote added] In addition to the turbocharger oil leak, the reports also mentioned a leak in the main engine exhaust system as another source of the smoke in the engineroom. Some other safety discrepancies reported by vessel masters are noted below:  The July 1995 report stated that the casing for the main fire pump was rusted through (""quarter-size holes"") and that the backup bilge pump was being used instead. The December 1995 report stated that the captain had to shut down the boiler ""due to fire hazard."" The November 1995 report stated that the ""fire hose threads do not match tug piping."" The September and October 1995 reports stated that ""the captain's room leaks water when raining. A lot of water!!! Floods!!!"" All reports from January to December 1995 stated that ""magnetic compass needs calibrating."" Eleven reports requested the replacement of safety guards on the air compressor belt. Six monthly reports requested safety guards for couplings on the steering gear pumps. Five reports from 1994 stated that both emergency escape hatches were sealed and inoperable. Five reports stated that hydraulic oil was leaking from steering gear valves.           The EMC's maintenance personnel could not provide documentation or details about when or whether the above discrepancies had been corrected. In February 1998, Safety Board investigators again interviewed the EMC operations manager, who administered the VIP, and the operations department supervisors responsible for reviewing and taking corrective action about discrepancy reports to determine why no action had been taken for long periods on the discrepancy reports. Their testimony is summarized below:  The company did not have a policy of keeping a record of repairs and did not have any record of repairs on the Scandia. (The EMC gave the Safety Board receipts for some repairs that subcontractors had done on the Scandia.) When Safety Board investigators showed the operations supervisors the discrepancy   Factual Information  20  reports, the supervisors could not recall any specifics about whether the problems mentioned in the reports had been corrected.  After the discrepancy reports were acknowledged that it often took no action were not communicated to maintenance maintenance system suffered from a lack departments in the EMC organization. reviewed, the operations staff and that vessel maintenance needs personnel. The staff said that the of communication among various     The EMC did not have a system of maintenance oversight to monitor whether repairs were properly conducted. An operations supervisor who reviewed the reports on the turbocharger oil leak and smoke explained that he did not take action because he did not have the technical knowledge to tell the difference between major and minor problems. Another operations supervisor responsible for reviewing the reports suggested that some captains exaggerated problems on their discrepancy reports, so he ignored the reports. The employment of two of the captains who had filed the discrepancy reports had been terminated around the time the accident occurred.    The captain of the Scandia asked Safety Board investigators to refer to the discrepancy reports to evaluate the maintenance of the Scandia.  Company Training and Drills Company representatives stated that the EMC's vessel crews received on-site training in drug and alcohol awareness, benzene handling, and tank barge vapor-recovery systems. Employees were also trained at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, New York, in survival at sea and in vapor-recovery systems. The company did not, and was not required to, train its employees at marine firefighting school. The captain said week stints on the tug. donning survival suits, Sunday, around noon at sleeping periods. that he tried to hold one emergency drill during each of his 2(The drills covered firefighting, dealing with a man overboard, and abandoning ship.) He said he usually held the drill on a the change of the watch, so as not to interfere with the crew's  He said that during fire drills, the crew laid out the hose from a fire hydrant, while the chief engineer activated the fire pump and provided pressurized water to the fire hydrants and the hose on deck. Tankerman 1 stated that firefighting drills on the Scandia involved the chief engineer starting the fire pump and the tankerman running the fire hose down an exterior side of the boat to extinguish an imaginary fire. He added that the drill was followed by a discussion of the firefighting scenario and that the participants   Factual Information  21  discussed each crewmember's duties and station during a fire. Tankerman 2 stated that drills were held every 4 to 6 weeks in summer. The captain said it was company policy to conduct drills; however, the EMC could not provide records of the drills. Coast Guard regulations do not require drills.  Fire Damage Safety Board investigators examined the damage on the Scandia and found no fire or smoke damage below the fidley grating, while the vessel was completely gutted above it. Investigators found evidence of severe fire damage near the center of the grating, which was directly above the main engine exhaust manifold. All the plastic switches, wooden workbenches, and various other combustible materials below the grating were unaffected by fire. There was no evidence of fires or leaks from the fuel or lube oil systems in the lower engineroom, where those systems and the Scandia's machinery were located. There was no evidence of a crankcase fire or explosion on the propulsion or generator engines. The metal casing of the exhaust gas turbocharger did not have any flame damage; the paint on the casing showed moderate discoloration from the effects of heat. (The turbocharger was about 15 feet aft of the center of the grating and just below it, and attached to the aft end of the engine's exhaust manifold pipe.) The rubber vibration pipe connection between the turbocharger and the air intake plenum was intact, but its upper exterior surface was moderately burned. From the grating upward, the engineroom was completely gutted by fire. All combustible insulation on the interior bulkheads, the overheads, and the wooden cabinets had been consumed. All electrical equipment in the fidley, including the main switchboard, circuit breakers, cables, and transformers, had been destroyed. Fire had destroyed the combustible contents of the vessel from the main deck up to the pilothouse, including the galley/dining area, the crew accommodations, and the stairway. The sheathings on all bulkheads and overheads, made of marinite and varnished wood, as well as mattresses, furnishings, and clothing, had been destroyed. Only the exterior steel of the superstructure remained. Near the grating, investigators observed the following:  The grating had been deformed by the heat of the fire and sagged down about 2 inches toward the exhaust manifold, where a section of the manifold's thermal insulation blanket had come loose. The protected glass globe of a light fixture, about 8 feet above the grating, had melted and sagged downward toward the exhaust manifold before solidifying.     Factual Information  22     Of two lifting I-beams in the fidley overhead, the port beam was warped from heat in a location above the sagging section of the deck grating. Black trickle marks of a solidified substance were found on the loosened insulation, as well as on the top and sides of the main engine. (Core Laboratories, Houston, Texas, could not positively identify samples of the substance sent to them by Safety Board investigators for analysis because the samples were contaminated with the barge's cargo oil when the Scandia ran aground and its engineroom flooded.) On the exterior of the vessel, the ventilation louvers on the port side of the stack showed heat damage, while the paint around the starboard louvers showed little heat damage.    On March 5, 1995, while the Scandia was moored at the Northeast Oil Terminal in New Haven, Connecticut, it had a fire in its engineroom. The fire was caused by a malfunction in the vessel's oil-fired hot-water heating system, which was in the aft starboard corner of the lower engineroom. The lower engineroom was significantly damaged, and extensive repairs were done at the EMC's repair facility later that month. After the repairs were completed, the Scandia was surveyed to the satisfaction of the ABS and continued operations. Safety Board investigators examined the hot-water boiler after the 1996 fire and found no recent fire damage. During the 1995 fire, the Scandia's crew fought the fire until firefighters from the local fire department arrived. According to a handwritten statement attached to the March discrepancy report, two crewmen borrowed breathing apparatus from the fire department firefighters and put out the fire. Afterward, the captain recommended that the EMC equip the Scandia with two sets of firesuits and SCBAs, so that the crew could effectively fight fires in the future. The EMC did not comply.  Waterway Information Long Island Sound is a deep navigable waterway connecting New York Harbor in the west to Block Island Sound, Rhode Island, on the east (see figure 1). Long Island Sound is about 110 miles long and 10 to 25 miles wide, and the waters are well marked with navigation aids. Marine traffic is sheltered from ocean storms and strong southerly winds by remaining in the lee of Long Island when transiting the sound. After leaving Long Island Sound, vessels proceed through the ""Race,"" which serves as a ""gateway"" to the next sound--Block Island Sound. Vessels are exposed to high southerly winds, waves, and ocean swells while in the Race because it does not have any islands to provide protective land cover. The Scandia had passed through the Race and by Watch Hill when the fire was reported. Block Island Sound is bounded by Rhode Island to the north and by Block Island to the south. The Atlantic Ocean lies east and south.   Factual Information  23  The coast of Rhode Island is lined with federally protected salt water ponds extending from Narragansett to Westerly, Rhode Island. The ponds are breeding grounds for fish and shellfish, and they are a refuge for waterfowl migrating along the Atlantic seaboard. At high tide, the sea breaches most of the ponds. The North Cape grounded about midway along a string of eight federally protected salt water ponds. The Scandia grounded near Trustom Pond, the centerpiece of a national wildlife preserve.  Meteorological Information At 7:20 p.m. on January 18, FleetWeather faxed the following forecast to the captain: January 18, evening, New York Harbor (departure of the Scandia): Winds out of the east-southeast at 15 to 25 knots, becoming south-southeasterly and increasing to 30 to 38 knots, with clouds, fog, and a chance of showers. January 19, early morning, Long Island Sound (planned transit of the Scandia): Southerly winds increasing to 35 to 45 knots. Seas 3 to 7 feet. January 19, between Watch Hill and Chatham, Massachusetts (Block Island and Rhode Island Sounds; planned transit of the Scandia): Southerly winds increasing to 35 to 45 knots a.m.; becoming westerly at 20 to 28 knots by late p.m., with rain, and seas of 4 to 8 feet. Much higher seas on waters exposed to south this p.m. (January 18) through January 19. The captain did not obtain further weather updates from FleetWeather on the day of the fire, nor did the EMC give him updates. When asked whether he had received weather updates, the captain did not tell Safety Board investigators in January 1996 that he had heard storm warnings on the tug's radio. Safety Board staff again interviewed him in February 1998 (see appendix), when he told investigators that he had been aware of the storm from radio broadcasts, but he did not provide details of when or what he heard. The Coast Guard routinely receives weather information from the National Weather Service (NWS) and makes urgent weather broadcasts, called safety marine information broadcasts (SMIBs), to warn mariners in case severe weather is forecast. Group Woods Hole broadcast a storm warning (SMIB) at 11:09 p.m. on January 18 and again on January 19 at 7:52 a.m., 12:26 p.m., and 2:26 p.m. The broadcasts were storm warnings14 for the region from Chatham to Watch Hill. (The Scandia had passed Watch Hill about an hour before it caught fire). For January 19, the SMIB forecast southerly winds from 25 to 35 knots during the day, increasing to 40 to 50 knots late in the day, and 10- to 20-foot seas. It also forecast rain, drizzle, and fog. For that night it forecast 14  According to the NWS, storm warnings are issued when winds of 48 knots or more are forecast.   Factual Information  24  southwest winds at 40 to 50 knots, diminishing later to 25 to 35 knots, and seas between 10 and 20 feet. A January 19 news release from the Coast Guard District Office warned mariners from Maine to New Jersey of a fast moving storm that could severely affect the area: A period of potentially dangerous winds from 40-50 knots with higher gusts is expected late today (19th Jan Friday) and tonight. Seas from 15 to 25 feet and minor coastal flooding are also expected.... Mariners are strongly reminded to closely monitor weather and Coast Guard emergency radio frequencies and seek safe shelter if needed. In addition to information about weather forecasts, Safety Board investigators obtained information regarding actual on-scene weather conditions from several other sources. A SAR message from Coast Guard Group Woods Hole described the on-scene weather at the time of the accident (2 p.m.) as southerly winds at 25 knots and seas between 6 and 8 feet. Also, the fishing vessel Seafarer, which was a mile away, was the first vessel to arrive on scene at 2:30 p.m.; its operation was not hampered by the weather. The fishing vessels Nautilus and Huntress were also operating in the area at that time. A situation report (SITREP) from the air station indicated that the on-scene weather was estimated at 10- to 12-foot seas and winds of 26 knots gusting to 36 knots, about 3 p.m., when the Coast Guard helicopter was providing air cover while the MLB crewmen rescued the crewmembers from the tug. At 4:30 p.m., the Coast Guard cutter Point Turner reported seas of 25 to 30 feet near the accident site.15 According to a SITREP from Group Woods Hole, the on-scene weather had deteriorated to 20- to 30-foot seas and winds in excess of 50 knots by about 5 p.m., when the Coast Guard MLB with two tug crewmen reached the barge to try to release its anchor.  Toxicological Information Coast Guard postaccident drug and alcohol testing regulations (46 CFR) require that specimens be collected ""as soon as practicable following an accident."" At approximately 10:30 p.m. on the day of the accident, the Coast Guard tested each member of the Scandia's crew with a breathalyzer for the presence of alcohol. All the results were negative.  The Point Turner was forced to abort its mission to assist the Scandia when sea action broke the attachments for the ship's refrigerated stores container.  15   Factual Information  25  Urine samples were collected to test for the presence of drugs16 about 5 a.m. the day after the accident and analyzed at South County Hospital, Wakefield, Rhode Island. The results for five of the crewmembers were negative. Results of the initial drug screening of the sixth crewmember, tankerman 1, identified the presence of amphetamines. Consistent with Federal regulations, the EMC contracted for the services of a medical review officer (MRO) to further analyze and interpret the test results. Subsequent testing was then done at a federally approved testing laboratory, Greystone Health Sciences Corporation, in La Mesa, California. The MRO attributed the presence of the amphetamines to a valid prescription medication being taken by the deckhand. The results of the drug test conducted at this facility showed that the presence of amphetamines was below the drug screening cutoff level. The MRO then certified that tankerman 1 tested negative for all drugs. Because a blood sample was not analyzed, it is not possible to determine whether the medication had impaired the tankerman.  Survival Factors Coast Guard Rescue Boats The coxswain told Safety Board investigators that he had initially selected a UTB instead of an MLB because the UTB was faster and had a closed cockpit to protect the crew from the weather. According to the Coast Guard's Operator's Handbook, the UTB is a light-weight aluminum-hulled, 26-knot, multi-mission vessel and is designed for moderate weather and seas. The MLB is an all-steel high-endurance boat designed for SAR missions in rough seas, including heavy surf and bad weather. It has a semi-enclosed coxswain's platform and a maximum speed of 13 knots.  Hypothermia Protective Clothing The crewmen on the SAR mission wore anti-exposure coveralls, the standard garments worn by Coast Guard crewmembers during cold-weather operations in closedcockpit boats. A coverall provides mobility and adequate protection from limited exposure to wind and spray, but it is not designed to protect someone who is immersed in cold water from hypothermia. When the coxswain, his crewmen, and the two tug crewmen later returned to the North Cape on the salvage mission, everyone except the coxswain wore survival suits. A survival suit encapsulates the wearer, providing excellent thermal protection for someone The urine samples were tested for the five drugs specified in Coast Guard (46 CFR 16.350) and Department of Transportation (49 CFR 40.21) regulations: marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine. 16   Factual Information  26  immersed in cold water. But the suit is cumbersome and bulky, making it difficult for the wearer to perform actions requiring dexterity. Both the UTB and the MLB carry survival suits. On the salvage mission, the coxswain wore a dry suit. The dry suit fits tightly so that it can keep the wearer dry and warm even if he is immersed in cold water. The suit is durable and flexible, and allows the coxswain the dexterity needed to operate the vessel, but it is not buoyant. Dry suits are normally stored at the boat station, rather than carried aboard the boats. When a coxswain is on a rescue mission, he is responsible for designating a crewmember to be a swimmer. If the coxswain knows before he gets to the accident scene that someone will have to be rescued from the water, he is supposed to have the swimmer don either a wet or a dry suit and a safety harness before the rescue boat arrives (Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M10470.10C ""Hypothermia Protective Clothing""). (A wet suit allows a layer of water to enter between the wearer's skin and the wet suit. Once the layer of water is warmed by the wearer's own body heat, it provides limited protection from hypothermia.)  Swimmer's Hypothermia The coxswain returned to the station as soon as he discovered that the swimmer had hypothermia. The coxswain told Safety Board investigators that he probably would have taken the tug crewmen directly to the barge had the swimmer not been hypothermic. He also said that had it not been for the explosion on the tug, he would have transferred the tug crewmembers directly to the MLB without their having to enter the water.  Other Information Towing Vessel Industry There are about 5,200 towing vessels in the United States, constituting, after fishing vessels, the largest segment of the U.S. commercial vessel industry. Most towing vessels are under 1,500 horsepower and operate mainly on inland waterways. The vessels push or tow 37,000 barges along the U.S. coasts, inland waterways, rivers, harbors, bays, and the Great Lakes. Over 32,000 crewmembers are employed for about 90 million onduty hours annually aboard the vessels. The members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) include the majority of the owners and operators of U.S. towing vessels and barges. It is the national trade association for the inland and coastal barge and towing industry. The AWO has recently established a responsible carrier program (RCP) designed to improve marine safety and environmental protection. The RCP provides AWO members with broad guidelines and a model to use in developing company-specific safety programs that incorporate safe   Factual Information  27  operating practices not currently required by Coast Guard regulations. According to the AWO, the RCP is a voluntary safety program, and each company should tailor the program to its own operations. The EMC is a member of the AWO and is currently working to adopt the RCP. However, not all towing companies in the United States are members of the AWO, and many companies have their own safety programs.  Towing Vessel Accidents The Safety Board's investigation of the September 1972 accident of the tug Carolyn and the unmanned barge Weeks No. 254 identified the need to arrest a drifting barge using its anchor, similar to the issue of arresting the drift of the North Cape in this accident. The Safety Board found that the Weeks could have been prevented from drifting into the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel (CBBT) by using the barge's anchor. The bridge's piers were damaged extensively, and the CBBT was closed for 14 days. The resulting loss, excluding the cost of repairing the CBBT, was estimated at $3,397,000 (in 1972 dollars). The accident occurred when the tug Carolyn lost propulsive power while towing the Weeks in the Chesapeake Bay. The vessels drifted in heavy winds and collided with the CBBT. The Coast Guard cutter Madrona and the commercial tug Warrengas were standing by to assist. The Safety Board determined that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the captain of the tug to inform the Madrona or the Warrengas that the barge had a quick-release anchor and the decision of the commanding officer of the Madrona not to take the tug in tow as a last resort. Although unmanned barges are not required by regulation to have anchors, the Weeks had one and a trailing trip wire to release the anchor. To activate the trip wire, the tug would have had to circle to the rear of the barge, but the tug had lost propulsion. Either of the assist vessels could have activated the trip wire but did not because their crews were not told of the wire's existence, and a trip wire is a rare feature on an unmanned barge. The tug dropped its own anchor, but the anchor was too small to hold against the combined pull of the barge and the tug. The Safety Board recommended that the Coast Guard: Determine the need for anchors on unmanned barges and practical methods of controlling such anchors in order to prevent damage to any vessel, bridge, or other structure or other loss to bystanders on the navigable waters of the United States. (M-74-4). In October 1976, the Coast Guard responded that the effectiveness of ""braking"" with an anchor depends on the time and distance available when the navigator finds the vessel in imminent danger of collision. The Coast Guard argued that most accidents occur when a vessel is navigating close to other vessels, piers, or bridges, where the effectiveness of dropping an anchor is negligible. Therefore, the Coast Guard concluded,   Factual Information  28  unmanned barges do not need to have anchors. In June 1977, the Safety Board classified the safety recommendation ""Closed--Acceptable Response."" Coast Guard Information on Towing Vessel Accidents. According to the Coast Guard, between 1992 and 1996, towing vessels had 188 fires, almost all of which started in an engineroom. Many of the fires resulted in a total constructive loss of the tug, and several could not be brought under control without the help of outside emergency responders. In number, fires ranked as the second most common type of towing vessel accident, after groundings. Coast Guard data show that 80 percent of the total fatalities (64 deaths) in the towing vessel industry between 1992 and 1995 are the result of slips on and falls overboard from tugs and barges during operations. The Coast Guard does not consider the data on crew injuries to be reliable, as the reporting threshold for injuries is subject to interpretation and, for various reasons, injuries are often not reported. In 1994, the Coast Guard published a report17 about the types and causes of accidents involving towing vessels. The report was based on statistics for 1981 through 1991. The study stated that the majority (58 to 62 percent) of towing vessel accidents were caused by human errors rather than by causes identifiable during vessel inspection, such as those associated with equipment or material failures (17 to 20 percent). The Coast Guard concluded that inspection requirements for towing vessels were not justified by the results of this study. Data on Oil Spills From Vessels. Coast Guard data on oil spills show that, in 1995, among all vessel types, barges were the leading contributors to medium oil spills (10,000 to 100,000 gallons) and to major oil spills (over 100,000 gallons). Medium and major oil spills accounted for 37 percent of the number of spills and 75 percent of the volume of oil spilled. Tank barges accounted for all three major oil spills in 1995 and for three of the four major oil spills in 1996, including this accident. The statistics for 1994 are similar: barges spilled 69 percent of the oil spilled and accounted for 38 percent of the number of medium and major oil spills. Of the oil spilled in medium and major oil spills, tanks ships accounted for only 3 percent of the volume. Between 1992 and 1996, barges spilled 67 percent of the oil spilled in medium and major oil spills, while tank ships and freight ships spilled 8 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Comparison of Regulations. Coast Guard regulations for tank vessels (tankers) are different from those for tug-oil barge systems in many areas of vessel safety. Table 1 compares some of the regulations in safety areas that are discussed in this accident report, such as fire safety and anchors on vessels.  17  Towing Vessel Inspection Study, August 1994, U.S. Coast Guard.   Factual Information  29  Table 1.

The phaseout deadline for a particular vessel depends on its age and size, with older and larger vessels scheduled to be phased out earlier, while smaller vessels (under 5,000 gross tons) can remain in service until 2015. According to the schedule, the North Cape must be either phased out or converted to a double hull by January 1, 2005. The Coast Guard estimates OPA 90 will affect 86 U.S. barges, 143 U.S. tank ships, and   Factual Information  30  856 international tank ships. In other words, 85 percent of the total domestic deadweight capacity presently available is scheduled to be retired or converted by 2015. On July 30, 1996, the Coast Guard published regulations designed to minimize the risk of oil pollution from single-hull barges until they are phased out in 2015. The regulations specify operational measures for towing vessels, including bridge resource management, vessel-specific watch keeping procedures, and minimum under-keel clearance. More regulations resulted from the grounding of the Morris Berman18 in Puerto Rico and from the Mauvilla19 accident (in which the towboat hit a railroad bridge in Alabama, causing 47 fatalities on Amtrak's Sunset Limited). In July 1996, the Coast Guard also issued a final rule, ""Navigation Safety Equipment for Towing Vessels,"" to ""help ensure that the mariner piloting a towing vessel has adequate equipment to safely navigate the waters being transited."" Under the rule, the towing vessel must have radar, searchlights, radios, compasses, swing-meters, echo-sounders, electronic position-fixing devices, and marine charts and publications. The rule also establishes standards for the maintenance, inspection, and serviceability of towlines and towing gear. In January 1997, the Coast Guard did an economic analysis and concluded that it is not economically feasible to retrofit double hulls onto single hulls. The Coast Guard determined that the potential environmental benefits are not significant compared with the costs of retrofitting a double hull, in view of the limited time remaining before the single-hulled vessels are phased out.  Tug of Opportunity System (TOS) A TOS is an organized system for diverting a tug, which may be towing or escorting another vessel or idling, to arrest a drifting oil barge or vessel. Under this system, information regarding the capabilities and locations of suitable tugs is monitored so that in an emergency the proper resources can be immediately dispatched to help. In addition, the system ensures that the tug is appropriate for the condition of the sea and for the size of the vessel to be helped. The Coast Guard is considering implementing such a system, operated by industry, in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. An alternative approach is to have dedicated tugs stationed in environmentally sensitive or otherwise high-risk areas to assist barges and tankers in distress.

Risk is the combination of the probability of an accident occurring together with its consequences. Risk assessment20 is an organized and systematic search for high-risk conditions existing in a system. It is a complex process by which the risks in a system are identified, prioritized, and presented. After the risks are identified, risk management strategies can be developed and prioritized in order of effectiveness. The system stakeholders can use the results of the risk assessment to select certain risk management strategies over others, based on the level of system risk they are willing to accept. The level of acceptable risk is often dictated by economic, social, and political considerations. In response to the Scandia accident, a regional risk assessment team (RRAT) was formed under the leadership of the Coast Guard and included representatives from the departments of environmental protection of the Northeastern States (Rhode Island, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York), the AWO, and environmental advocacy groups. In February 1997, the representatives completed a report titled Regional Risk Assessment of Petroleum Transportation on the Waters of the Northeast United States (RRAT report). In the report, the RRAT reviewed current industry practices, reviewed casualty and oil spill data, critiqued Federal regulations, and assessed industry programs that influence vessel operation. The RRAT's purpose was to develop recommendations to help the Coast Guard develop regulations to improve safety and reduce the risks of transporting petroleum products by tug-barges through the Northeastern States. The scope of the report was limited, as it did not address fire safety on towing vessels; the Towing Safety Advisory Committee21 (TSAC) later submitted recommendations on fire safety to the Coast Guard for consideration in its rulemaking.  Rulemakings after Accident The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 required the Coast Guard to develop regulations, in consultation with the TSAC, to reduce the number of oil spills from single-hull barges. The Act requires an oil barge to have at least one of the following features:  For more information on risk assessment as it applies to marine vessel operations, see Marine Accident Report--Allison of the Liberian Freighter Bright Field with the Poydras Street Wharf, Riverwalk Marketplace, and New Orleans Hilton Hotel in New Orleans, Louisiana, December 14, 1996 (NTSB/MAR-98/01). The TSAC provides the Coast Guard with industry and operations-related recommendations to assist with the development of regulations. The TSAC is authorized by Congress and represents a broad cross section of the towing industry. 21  20   Factual Information  32  (a) an operable anchor and a crewmember capable of stopping the barge from drifting ashore, (b) an emergency system that will allow the tug to retrieve the barge if the tow line breaks, and (c) any other means, equivalent to the above, to protect the barge from grounding. In addition, the Act requires that a tug engaged in towing barges have a fire suppression system or its equivalent. In response to the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, the Coast Guard issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in October 1997 to improve towing-vessel and tank barge safety in a variety of areas. The proposed rules were developed in consultation with the TSAC, as required by the Authorization Act, and were based on the recommendations made in the RRAT report. The Coast Guard proposed the following rules in response to the Scandia accident: For improving fire suppression measures aboard towing vessels, the Coast Guard proposed that all new tugs and, within 2 years, all existing tugs have the following:   A firemain system and fire pump that can be operated from the tug's pilothouse and locally at the pump. Fixed fire extinguishing systems in enginerooms on new tugs longer than 79 feet,22 in addition to the portable extinguishers that regulations currently require. For smaller new tugs and existing tugs of any size, semi-portable extinguishers are required in addition to the portable fire extinguishers currently required. Remote fuel and engine shutdowns. Muster list that identifies the crew's responsibilities and procedures in a firefighting emergency. Instruction and drills, including engineroom firefighting drills that are held at least once a month. Safety orientations to familiarize crewmembers with their vessel's safety features.       The NPRM solicited public comment on voyage planning requirements and mentions recommendations made by the RRAT and the TSAC to the Coast Guard on this Seventy-nine feet is used to differentiate between large and small tugs for application of the regulations and follows the same breakpoint used for fishing vessel regulations. The need for the differentiation is based on the practicality, space limitations, and cost effectiveness of installing certain equipment on small tugs. 22   Factual Information  33  subject. The recommendations include requiring documented company policies and procedures to take into account weather forecasts and the adequacy of vessel equipment before starting a voyage. The NPRM proposed any one of three methods for stopping drifting tank barges:  Operable Anchor for Manned Barges: In an emergency, a trained person on the barge can drop the anchor. The anchor system should be maintained and inspected to ensure that it is operable. The NPRM did not propose operable anchors for unmanned barges. Emergency Barge Retrieval System: The tug and barge are equipped with an emergency retrieval system that allows the tug to retrieve the barge if the towline breaks. The tug's crewmembers must be trained in the use of the equipment, and annual retrieval drills should be conducted. The system can be used on either an unmanned or a manned barge. Any Other Approved System: This option allows for the use of systems developed by industry in the future that offer a level of safety equal to or greater than the level offered by the other measures.      Pollution Response The method of coordinating the participating agencies; the Federal, State, and local governments; the trustees; and the industry, civic, and environmental groups that were involved in cleaning up the pollution are outlined in the area contingency plan. The pollution cleanup was coordinated by the Coast Guard acting as the Federal on-scene coordinator (FOSC). The FOSC set up a command post in Galilee, Rhode Island, and was assisted by the Coast Guard's Atlantic Strike Team (AST) and a regional response team composed of Federal, State, and local government representatives and the EMC. An estimated 700 people were involved in the pollution response and cleanup. The Federal Government billed the EMC about $1,900,000 for the cost of cleaning up the pollution. The DEM and NOAA were notified of a potentially major oil spill about 3 p.m. on the day of the accident, according to Coast Guard status reports on pollution response and notification activities (POLREPs). NOAA personnel estimated the trajectory of the potential spill to determine its probable impact on the coastline. POLREPs show that the AST was activated about 4 p.m. and arrived on scene around midnight. The AST assisted the FOSC by coordinating response, salvage, and lightering (pumping out remaining oil from the North Cape) activities, monitoring contractors, and assessing shoreline cleanup priorities. About 6:15 p.m., the EMC authorized its oil-spill cleanup contractors to deploy deflection booms, sorbent materials, and onshore/offshore oil skimmers to protect areas identified by the Coast Guard as being environmentally sensitive. About the same time, the EMC also engaged a marine salvage company and deployed three tugs and a 30,000barrel-capacity oil barge to lighter the remaining oil from the North Cape so that it would not exacerbate the pollution by continuing to leak. The lightering operations were   Factual Information  34  severely restricted over the next few days by intermittently stormy weather (winds up to 50 knots and 6- to 8-foot seas), which endangered the lightering and salvage crews. The AST report states that 74,550 barrels of heating oil were lightered from the North Cape. The North Cape was eventually re-floated off Nebraska Shoal on January 26, 1996, and removed from the scene.   35  Analysis  Exclusions The following factors were eliminated as causal to the accident: the crew's qualifications, fatigue, and use of drugs. The Coast Guard took the tug crewmembers to shore about 3 hours after the fire was detected. The opportunity to conduct chemical testing was further delayed because of the crewmembers' involvement in the salvage operations. During the salvage operation, two tug crewmembers tried to board the barge, and the captain and remaining crewmen were on shore monitoring the salvage and communicating with the salvage crew. Thus, all tug crewmen were involved in the salvage operation in some capacity. The last crewmember, who was airlifted from the barge, was returned to shore after 10 p.m. Shortly thereafter, all crewmembers were tested for alcohol. Because 9 hours had elapsed between the fire and the breathalyzer test, the Safety Board cannot conclusively determine that alcohol was not present in any of the Scandia crewmembers.23 24 On the day of the accident, none of the tug crewmembers reported suffering from any serious medical conditions. No evidence suggests that any of the crewmembers were impaired by alcohol or controlled substances. Tankerman 1 had been taking prescription medicine containing amphetamines. Although it could not be determined what, if any, effect the medicine had on him at the time of the accident, nothing about his performance suggests that he was impaired. Although the crewmembers had less than 6 hours of sleep before the start of their shift, it does not appear that their performance was impaired by fatigue or that fatigue played any role in this accident. 25  The qualifications of the crewmembers either met or exceeded the requirements of the Coast Guard. Because of the rate at which humans metabolize alcohol, evidence of alcohol is usually eliminated from the body in about 8 hours. Because problems and solutions associated with the timing of postaccident drug and alcohol testing were explored in a March 13-15, 1997, Safety Board Public Hearing and were comprehensively addressed in a subsequent Safety Board report, they are not discussed here. For more information, read Marine Special Investigation Report--Postaccident Testing for Alcohol and Other Drugs in the Marine Industry and the Ramming of the Portland-South Portland (Million Dollar) Bridge at Portland, Maine, by the Liberian Tankship Julie N on September 27, 1996 (NTSB/SIR-98/02). Because the crewmembers worked on a 6-hour-on-6-hour-off schedule, it is unlikely that they slept for a full 6 consecutive hours when they were off duty. 25 24 23   Analysis  36  Safety Issues In this accident, the Safety Board identified the following safety issues, which are examined in this report: Origin and cause of fire. Management oversight of vessel maintenance. Risk assessment: Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels. Search and rescue: Deployment of Coast Guard rescue boat. Hypothermia protective clothing. Decision to return to barge to drop its anchor. Environmental pollution and cleanup.  Fire Safety Board investigators analyzed the fire damage they saw in the Scandia's fidley to determine the fire's point of origin and cause. The investigators ruled out the exhaust gas turbocharger in the lower engineroom as a point of origin for several reasons. Because the turbocharger was separated by as much as 15 feet (aft) from the center of the fidley, which was the part that was most severely damaged by the fire, and because no burn path indicated that the fire had traveled between the two locations, the moderate heat discoloration of the paint on the turbocharger casing alone does not indicate that the turbocharger was likely to have been the place where the fire began. The absence of damage on the casing from flame impingement, together with the fact that the rubber vibration joint remained intact and unmelted, indicates that the turbocharger was not exposed to the large high-temperature fire that consumed the parts of the vessel above. Instead, the discoloration of the casing and the surface burns on the rubber joint are consistent with damage sustained during the long periods when the lube oil from the turbocharger leaked onto the adjacent hot engine manifold and onto the rubber joint and burned--a maintenance problem repeatedly mentioned on EMC   Analysis  37  discrepancy reports. However, the effects of heat from just above the rubber joint and turbocharger, would discoloration caused by the leaking oil. The Safety Bo leaking turbocharger oil was a serious fire hazard, it was the lower engineroom had no other damage from fire or out as the location of the origin of the fire.  the fire in the fidley, which was have exacerbated the burn and ard determines that although the not the cause of the fire. Because smoke, the Safety Board ruled it  The most intense heat damage was concentrated around the center and port areas of the fidley grating, where the steel had melted and sagged downward. The I-beam on the port side, which was above the sagging section of grating, was warped from the heat, showing that the hottest area was both below it and toward the port side. Because the natural convection of air causes heat to rise and fires to burn upward, the fire most likely originated at the grating and then traveled upward. Also, glass globes of light bulbs soften when heated and normally bulge out in the direction of the hottest temperature, providing a clue to where a fire has started. In this case, the bulb pointed to the sagging section of the fidley grating. Greater heat damage on the port-side ventilation louvers on the exhaust stack, compared to the starboard louvers, also indicates that the fire was more intense on the port side of the fidley. The testimony of the captain and the dayman, both of whom fought the fire, is also consistent with the physical evidence of the fire damage, in that they reported seeing scattered small fires near the center of the fidley and toward the port side but no fire in the engineroom below. All these factors lead to the same conclusion; consequently, the Safety Board concludes that the fire on the Scandia originated near the center of the fidley grating, which was above the main engine exhaust manifold. The Safety Board attempted to determine what may have caused the fire. Because laboratory tests failed to identify the blackened residue on the manifold where its insulation had come loose and on the sides of the engine below it and because the EMC and the crew could not provide any useful information, investigators considered substances that were likely to have been used aboard the tug at the time it caught fire.26 Because the Scandia was approaching the confined waters near Providence, the normal practice would have been to haul in the towline (barge) and put the Scandia in the pushing mode. The crew was probably preparing to apply grease to the steel towline before hauling it in, in keeping with common industry practice.  Various greases, lubricants, and paints were typically used by the crew of the Scandia for routine maintenance and operation of the tug's towline, machinery, and equipment. According to the manufacturer's data sheets, the greases and lubricants are petroleum based and pose a fire risk; consequently, they should be stored in sealed containers away from hot surfaces and areas of high temperature, such as the fidley.  26   Analysis  38  As part of the preparation, a crewmember may have placed a container of the towline grease (or a similar flammable lubricant) on the fidley grating to melt the grease before applying it. According to the EMC, the towline grease is normally stowed in a 5gallon container on the weather deck, where it was cold that day and where the grease might have solidified. The EMC did not have a documented and enforceable policy of prohibiting the storage of flammable liquids in the engineroom. Because the Scandia was rolling in 8- to 10-foot seas, the grease probably spilled from its container onto the grating. In this event, the grease-like substance would have melted and dripped onto the part of the manifold with loose insulation; the temperature of the manifold, 950  F, would have been high enough to ignite27 the substance on contact. The blackened residue observed on the manifold and on the sides of the engine below it was most likely the burned, grease-like substance. The substance that spilled is more likely to have been a high-viscosity grease-like material, such as towline lubricant, than a comparatively low-viscosity kerosene or diesel, as the latter would have run through the grating onto the engine and ignited. Such an event would have left evidence of a fire on the top and sides of the engine and, probably, also on the walkways around the engine. The Safety Board concludes that rough seas may have caused a container of flammable lubricant to fall onto the part of the engine manifold that had loose insulation, where the lubricant ignited on contact; however, the cause of the fire could not be precisely determined. After igniting at the manifold, the fire, because of natural convection, spread upward into the fidley and set fire to the puddles of spilled grease lying on the grating. The burning puddles provide a reasonable explanation for what the crewmen described as a number of small scattered fires on the grating. The flames from the burning grease then gradually set fire to the wooden storage cabinets attached to the bulkhead; from there, the fire progressed to the bulkheads themselves and then to the overheads. Because the tug's interior bulkheads were sheathed with combustible materials, the fire from the fidley continued to spread upward to the accommodations and to the remaining parts of the Scandia. Because the fire moved up and away from the manifold, the remaining sections of insulation on the manifold were not burned. The Federal Bureau of Investigation participated in the U.S. Department of Justice's criminal investigation of this accident but found no evidence to suggest that anyone had deliberately set the fire, and neither the EMC nor the vessel's crew was subsequently charged by the Department of Justice with deliberately setting the fire. (See appendix.) Safety Board investigators also found no evidence that the fire was deliberately set. The flash point of the towline grease/lubricant used on the Scandia was about 457 F, according to the EMC. 27   Analysis  39  Management Oversight of Vessel Maintenance After reviewing the Scandia's discrepancy reports, interviewing EMC operations department personnel responsible for the oversight of vessel maintenance, and evaluating the implementation of the EMC's VIP, the Safety Board determined that the EMC's management oversight of vessel maintenance was poor, which resulted in reducing the safety of its vessels. The VIP formed the cornerstone of the EMC's program of having its management oversee vessel maintenance. However, the Safety Board found that although the EMC had a VIP on paper, the EMC did not implement the VIP in practice, as evidenced by the discrepancy reports. Had the EMC followed its VIP, there would not have been the numerous instances of extended delays in repairing safety and maintenance items because the program required that serious safety deficiencies be repaired within about 2 weeks. Instead, safety and maintenance problems were not corrected for months, sometimes for more than a year. For example, when the Scandia's engineroom underwent extensive repairs after the 1995 fire in the boiler, the EMC could have fixed the long-outstanding problems noted on the discrepancy reports for the previous months.28 Instead, the EMC did not fix serious29 discrepancies, as evidenced by a subsequent discrepancy report that the turbocharger was leaking and by a leak in the exhaust system. Signi complaints management that repairs procedures. ficant delays in making repairs, as evidenced by the on their monthly discrepancy reports, demonstrate did not oversee the maintenance process and did not have were done in a timely enough manner to comply with crew's repeated that the EMC's controls to ensure the EMC's own  Because the EMC, by policy, did not keep maintenance or repair records, the operations department did not have a database with which to track the Scandia's history of repairs and maintenance. Without such a history, maintenance managers could not monitor trends in failure rates of the Scandia's equipment and could not make informed decisions about the vessel's need for preventative maintenance. The result was poor maintenance of the Scandia and repeated complaints from its captains. Lacking a proactive preventative maintenance approach, the EMC defaulted to making repairs only after systems broke down, hampering the vessel's operation and the EMC's commercial objectives. Not only did the absence of a planned maintenance program result in the Scandia being poorly maintained, the absence probably affected the maintenance of the entire  When a vessel undergoes extensive repairs and overhauls, it is generally economical, as well as convenient, to do other outstanding repairs. According to the ABS, exhaust leaks can be serious safety hazards and result in a vessel's safety classification status being withdrawn; however, ABS rules state that it is the vessel owner's responsibility to bring known deficiencies that could affect a vessel's classification status to the ABS's attention. There is no record in ABS survey documents of the turbocharger and exhaust leaks. Regulations do not require uninspected tugs to be classed with the ABS. 29  28   Analysis  40  EMC fleet. The EMC's process for exercising vessel maintenance (the VIP) was applied to all vessels in the EMC fleet and was enforced by the same personnel at the EMC. The EMC's practice of making repairs only after serious breakdowns had already occurred, rather than taking a preventive maintenance approach, and its poor oversight of maintenance resulted in a reduction of the Scandia's safety. Some of the discrepancies, such as missing safety guards, required relatively minor effort to fix; consequently, they should have been expeditiously repaired by vessel crewmen. By allowing the vessel's fire pump to corrode to the point of developing holes the size of a quarter, by permitting fire hoses with mismatched hose threads, and by sealing off emergency escape hatches, the EMC rendered these key safety features ineffective. Because the engineroom smoke described in the discrepancy report for June 1995 was severe enough to have been seen by passing vessels, the smoke was likely to have discouraged the Scandia's crewmembers from effectively monitoring the proper functioning of engineroom equipment during their engineroom tours. In addition to being an obvious safety hazard for the Scandia, the severe smoke also posed a health hazard for its crew. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that the EMC's oversight of vessel maintenance for its fleet was inadequate and that the implementation of its VIP was ineffective. The Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement an effective management oversight program that provides maintenance managers with enough information to track maintenance trends and to make informed maintenance decisions that will ensure the safety of the company's fleet and crews. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) adopted the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code) in 1993. The ISM Code provides important guidance to shipping companies for exercising oversight of the operation and maintenance of oil tankers in international trade. However, no comparable guidance applies to tug-barges involved in domestic oil transportation. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard and the AWO should cooperate to develop and implement an effective safety management code to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. The Safety Board notes that although the EMC is establishing a personal computer-based maintenance and repair database for its fleet, enough information is not yet available to judge its quality.  Risk Assessment The assessment and management of risk are the foundations of the Coast Guard's marine-safety and environmental-protection regulations, which are designed to prevent marine accidents and their effects on the public and environment.   Analysis  41  The RRAT's risk assessment, performed after the Scandia accident, was intended to assist the Coast Guard in developing effective towing vessel safety regulations. However, after analyzing the regulations proposed by the NPRM in light of this accident investigation, the Safety Board finds that a number of significant risks are not adequately addressed by the risk management strategies proposed in the NPRM. Some of the proposed risk management strategies include:     Weather and voyage planning. Barge retrieval systems. Anchors on unmanned barges. Fire safety of towing vessels.  Each of these risk management strategies is discussed below in light of the risks exposed in this investigation. Weather and Voyage Planning. The Safety Board analyzed the captain's vessel operations in light of the predicted weather and the actual on-scene weather and found that although a winter storm was rapidly approaching, the captain continued to proceed into the open seas of the Race, thus reducing his margin of safety for avoiding the storm. Further, the captain did not take into account updated weather information to reassess his decision to continue his voyage beyond the sheltered waters of Long Island Sound to the Race, and neither he nor the EMC had any plan to consider alternatives in case the vessel was endangered by the storm. The SMIBs, the NWS weather forecasts, and the Coast Guard's news release all predicted that the seas and winds would worsen rapidly later that afternoon. A comparison of the forecasts with accounts of actual on-scene weather, obtained from several SITREPs and from the MLB crewmen, shows that the forecasts were accurate in predicting that the storm would intensify in the late afternoon. Weather information from the MLB crewmembers is reliable because they were on scene both before and after the storm had reached its height. That the rapid change in on-scene weather was consistent with the forecast of a ""fast moving storm"" during the late afternoon is evidenced by the timeline below: 1:57 p.m.: winds S-SE/ 25 knots, seas 6 to 8 feet about 3 p.m.: winds 26 to 36 knots, seas 10 to 12 feet 4:30 p.m.: seas 25 to 30 feet 5 p.m.: winds S-SE /40 to 50 knots, seas 20 to 30 feet In the 1 1/2 hours after the fire started, the weather deteriorated significantly enough for the Scandia to be in danger of being swamped by 20- to 30-foot waves.   Analysis  42  Because the Scandia was just over an hour away30 from the shelter of Narragansett Bay (which lay en route to Providence) when the fire started, the captain might have reached the bay during the 1 1/2 hours if the fire had not broken out. However, the captain did not have detailed weather updates or information with which to plan or ""time"" his voyage; he simply proceeded toward the bay because it was the shelter closest to him and was en route to his destination. The captain's margin of safety was so narrow that he might have failed to reach the shelter of the bay even had there been no fire, because the timing of fast-moving storms usually cannot be predicted precisely. The weather also played a key role in the grounding of and pollution from the North Cape. After the Scandia's crew was rescued by the Coast Guard, the waves rapidly increased between 3 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. The crewmen who later boarded the barge to release its anchor discovered that the waves had increased to between 20 and 30 feet and were washing over the barge, making it impossible to release the ""jury-rigged"" anchor without risking severe injury. Had the weather not turned so severe, they may have been able to release the anchor, even though it would have taken longer than if the windlass had been in place. (The effect of releasing the anchor is discussed later under ""Anchors on Barges."") The severity of the weather also prevented other assist vessels, such as the tug Morton Bouchard, from reaching the scene in time to prevent the North Cape from drifting aground. The tug Catherine departed about 3:50 p.m. from New London, Connecticut, but was considerably slowed because the storm was reaching its peak about that time. Both tugs arrived after the North Cape had already run aground. After the storm gained intensity, 30-foot waves and 50-knot winds forced the Coast Guard cutter Point Turner to abort its attempt while en route to the North Cape. A small harbor tug at the station's harbor, the Capt Tom, overheard the Scandia's MAYDAY but was unable to assist because it was incapable of operating in such severe weather without endangering itself. Despite the prediction of a sharp deterioration in the weather, the captain of the Scandia allowed himself only a narrow margin in which to avoid facing such weather in open seas; consequently, the Safety Board analyzed the EMC's operations to determine whether establishing voyage planning procedures could increase the safety of the operations of the EMC's vessels. This investigation shows that the EMC had no procedures that would enable the crew to assess weather-related voyage risks or require the captain to obtain updated weather information or require the captain to consult the EMC's shoreside management about the risk of continuing the voyage under the prevailing weather conditions. The lack of participation by the EMC's shoreside management in evaluating and responding to the risks posed by the predicted storm reduced the operational safety of the tug and barge.  Based on a reduced speed of 5 knots due to the weather and a distance of 6.5 miles to the entrance of Naragansett Bay from the Scandia's location when the fire was reported.  30   Analysis  43  Because the captain did not obtain updated weather information, he did not have the information necessary to assess the risk involved in continuing his voyage into the Race. He may have underestimated how close he actually was to the storm front. Updated and long-term (48 to 72 hours) weather information would have helped him plan his voyage more prudently, significantly increasing the safety margin of his operations. The captain and the EMC's shoreside management did not consult about continuing the voyage from Long Island Sound into the Race. Had the EMC's management helped the captain to identify the risks, alternative courses of action could have resulted. An example of an alternative would have been the captain seeking safe harbor while the Scandia was sailing in the sheltered lee of Long Island Sound before proceeding into the exposed waters of the Race, where the vessel encountered rapidly worsening weather. The lack of an operable windlass may have deterred the captain from seeking shelter in the sound because once an anchor is dropped, it cannot be retrieved without a windlass. However, the need for an anchor in case the weather rapidly worsened should have been considered by the EMC through use of an equipment checklist as a part of voyage planning procedures. Although the EMC left all weather-related decisions entirely to the captain, the Safety Board points out that current maritime safety management practices, such as those embodied in the ISM Code, emphasize that responsibility for vessel safety cannot be limited to ship captains but must be shared by the upper levels of the company's shoreside management.31 Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement procedures whereby designated management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. The procedures should be directed toward facilitating the making of timely decisions that affect the safety of company vessels and crews. The Safety Board also believes that the Coast Guard should require towing vessel companies to develop and implement procedures whereby management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. Voyage planning does more than improve the communications between a captain and his company's shoreside management; voyage planning can significantly improve a company's oversight of operations and its evaluation of weather-related risks, thereby reducing, at the planning stages of a voyage, the risk of an accident. The Scandia accident shows that EMC's inadequate oversight of vessel operations resulted in the Scandia's lack of preparedness to encounter the predicted bad weather and contributed to the accident. For example, if the EMC had had a checklist to ensure that the loose equipment and material aboard the Scandia were secured in heavy weather, to ensure that flammable materials were not stored in the engineroom, and to ensure that the North Cape was adequately equipped for the anticipated weather, the crew might have thought through the  For more information, see Marine Accident Report--Near Grounding of the Liberian Tank Ship Patriot, Bay of Campeche, Mexico, October 15, 1995 (NTSB/MAR-97/01/SUM).  31   Analysis  44  process of preparing for heavy weather and taking the necessary precautions, thus significantly improving the safety of operations. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that because the EMC did not have adequate voyage planning procedures to ensure that adequate weather information and operational precautions were considered in its decisionmaking, the risk reduction measures that could have been taken before the voyage began were not taken. Consequently, the Safety Board believes that the EMC should develop and implement voyage planning procedures and checklists for its towing vessels to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. Further, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard, in conjunction with the towing vessel industry, should develop and implement requirements for voyage planning standards and checklists for towing vessel companies to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. Moreover, the AWO should encourage its member towing vessel companies to develop and implement such standards and checklists. The Coast Guard's NPRM solicited public comments on voyage planning, and the Safety Board's recommendations, based on the findings of this accident investigation, are particularly relevant to the Coast Guard's request. They highlight the importance of voyage planning to the safety of tug-barge operations. Barge Retrieval Systems. In its NPRM, the Coast Guard proposed the use of an emergency barge retrieval system as an acceptable method by which a tug can recover its barge if the towline breaks. If the towline between a tug and its barge breaks, the tug can use an emergency barge retrieval system to retrieve its barge, but only if the tug, itself, is operational. In this accident, however, even if the Scandia had had a retrieval system, the vessel could not have used the system because the vessel was completely disabled by the fire. The same consequence would also result if a tug were to suffer other casualties, such as flooding, sinking, capsizing in heavy seas, or grounding. In such situations, a tug that has a retrieval system and is dispatched from another location is needed to retrieve the drifting barge. While a number of tugs set out to assist the North Cape and were prevented by the weather from arriving on scene in time, the tugs were not strategically located when they started their journey to assist and were selected by chance. No organized system ensured that the tugs were strategically located so they could reach the accident scene in time or that the tugs were powerful enough or possessed the proper equipment to provide the assistance necessary. There was also no assurance that their crewmembers were trained to handle emergency retrieval operations without seriously endangering themselves and their tugs. A TOS or an alternative system, therefore, may be necessary to complement the proposed retrieval system:   Analysis  45  In this accident there was a 4 -hour period, from the start of the fire to the grounding of the barge, within which the barge could have been retrieved. The Safety Board concludes that the use of a tug assistance system in conjunction with a barge retrieval system would have significantly improved the chance of arresting the drift of the North Cape and preventing its grounding. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard and the towing industry should institute a pilot project in the northeastern United States to evaluate the benefits of using an organized tug-assistance system to complement the proposed barge retrieval system or, if appropriate, develop and implement an alternative system to ensure barge retrieval if a tug becomes incapable of performing that function. Anchors on Unmanned Barges. An appropriately designed and installed  anchoring system may have reduced the possibility of grounding and pollution. chosen Sound. way to valuabl option. The captain had probably long been aware of the oncoming storm and could have to wait out the storm by dropping anchor in a harbor of safe refuge in Long Island However, the lack of a windlass would have deterred him because there is no easy retrieve an anchor without a windlass, and he would have lost the anchor--a e piece of equipment. This fact may explain why the captain never considered this  It is difficult to say with certainty whether the drifting North Cape could have been completely stopped before running aground even if the anchor and windlass had been properly installed and operable. The ability of an anchor to stop a vessel depends on various unknown factors, such as the holding power of the sea bottom compared to the magnitude of the drag forces exerted on the barge by the seas and wind. While an anchor is often ineffective in stopping a self-propelled vessel within a limited distance when the vessel is traveling at speed, the North Cape was drifting slowly, and there was a considerable distance for the anchor to take hold on the bottom before the barge grounded. Having an anchor drag along the bottom would have slowed the barge down and may have stopped it before it reached shore, thus giving the assist tugs much more time to reach it. The Safety Board therefore concludes that an operable anchor may have reduced the chance of the barge grounding. Anchors are routinely used to hold (to ""anchor"") a vessel in a waterway and are safety devices. (Although anchors are also used in emergencies as a braking device to stop the motion of a vessel that is underway at speed, anchors are not designed for this purpose and are likely to fail.) Just as Coast Guard regulations require anchors on manned barges to enhance their safety, so would anchors increase the safety of unmanned barges. The Coast Guard, however, does not require an unmanned barge to have an anchor because the Coast Guard recognizes that normally there is no one on an unmanned barge to release the anchor. Nevertheless, the North Cape was not unique in having an anchor and windlass because many owners equip their unmanned barges with an anchor and windlass for operational convenience. On such a barge, a crewman jumps from the tug to the barge.   Analysis  46  While the jump is usually safe under routine conditions, in rough seas or unfavorable conditions, the probability of injuries and deaths can be unacceptably high. In this accident, the lives of two tug crewmen were seriously endangered by the turbulent seas when they jumped aboard the North Cape to release the anchor. Even if the anchor and windlass had been properly installed, the Safety Board would have considered the risk to the crewmen's lives to be just as excessive. The Board's determination is supported by Coast Guard accident statistics, which show that slips and falls overboard are the largest cause of deaths and injuries in the towing industry. The Safety Board thinks that such risk reduction strategies as remotely operated quick releases for barge anchors should be considered as a way of avoiding the risks associated with transferring people to an unmanned barge. An example of using conventional technology for a remote anchor release is the trailing trip wire system that was used on the Weeks. The Safety Board notes that a trailing trip wire is not effective unless the tug is functional enough to be able to approach the trip wire to trip it. The Safety Board concludes that when a tug is disabled, modern devices, such as radiofrequency transmitters, that are suitably located on the tug may be effective in releasing the barge's anchor by remote control and that the use of such transmitters does not involve imposing risks on the crew. A remotely operated mechanism can be designed to operate independently of the tug's primary power systems so that the device is not dependent on the tug's ability to propel or steer itself. A remote device can be activated quickly even if a tug has lost propulsion or steering, is involved in a fire, or is sinking. In its NPRM, the Coast Guard invited readers to propose technological solutions to the problem of arresting drifting barges that are better than the existing techniques, which are often hazardous to the crews. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard, in conjunction with the towing vessel industry, should develop modern remote anchor release devices for barges in emergencies that do not expose crewmen to unnecessary risk. Further, the Safety Board believes that the AWO should encourage its members to work with the Coast Guard to develop a means of releasing anchors on unmanned towed barges by remote control from the towing vessel. Fire Safety of Towing Vessels. The safety of the Nation's fleet, about 30,000 barges, and its personnel and cargo, as well as the safety of the marine environment, depends to a large extent on the fire safety of the vessels that tow the barges. The fact has been consistently demonstrated by accident statistics for towing vessels, which show that fires are the second largest cause of towing vessel accidents. The statistics also show that almost all fires occur in the engineroom, where ignition sources, such as hot operating machinery and electrical equipment, are close to flammable fuels and oils and to the combustible materials used in the vessel's construction. The Scandia fire demonstrates how rapidly a fire on a tug can get out of control and cause a second accident involving a barge in its tow. The second accident caused large-scale pollution that significantly damaged the environment and drew public attention to this accident. The Safety Board determines that the chances of preventing pollution from towed oil barges would be greatly enhanced if Coast Guard regulations adequately addressed the fire safety of towing vessels.   Analysis  47  Despite the fact that the Scandia had firefighting equipment, such as the semiportable fire extinguishing system and the fire pump, that exceeded the Coast Guard requirements, the crew could not reach the equipment during the emergency. The intensity of the smoke and heat prevented the crewmembers from entering the fidley, and they could not reach the controls for the semi-portable extinguisher, which were only a few feet inside the fidley door. Consequently, the equipment was ineffective in fighting the fire. To use the semi-portable system, crewmembers would have had to enter the fidley and move close to the fire so that they could manually unreel the hose and direct its nozzle toward the base of the fire. To enter the fidley, however, the crew would have had to wear firemen's outfits and SCBAs. (A fireman's outfit provides protection from the heat, and an SCBA provides smoke-free, breathable air.) Firemen's outfits and SCBAs would also have significantly increased the effectiveness of the portable extinguishers, as the crewmen would have been able to get the extinguishers closer to the fire. The Safety Board notes that after the earlier fire on the Scandia (in 1995), the captain recommended that the EMC equip the vessel with two sets of firesuits and SCBAs and that the EMC did not comply. (The Safety Board also notes that the EMC has now provided its fleet with the equipment, but only after being directed to do so by a court.) The Safety Board concludes that the Scandia accident demonstrates the need for SCBAs and firesuits on towing vessels. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should require SCBAs and firesuits aboard all towing vessels, as well as training in their use. The crew would have been safer if the Scandia had had a fixed firefighting system in the engineroom that could be remotely operated from outside the engineroom. Crewmembers would not have been subject to the physical risks involved in entering a fire- and smoke-filled fidley, and the firefighting would have been more effective. The Safety Board supports the NPRM in proposing the requiring of fixed fire extinguishing systems in the enginerooms of new tugs but notes that the NPRM does not require fixed fire extinguishing systems aboard existing tugs. Also, the NPRM would not require tugs such as the Scandia to have firefighting equipment beyond what is already aboard the vessel, which the crew could not operate in this accident because the equipment controls were located in areas made inaccessible by the fire. The Safety Board concludes that the NPRM proposes a lower level of safety for existing tugs than for new tugs and would not make existing tugs any safer from the kind of fire that the Scandia experienced in this accident. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should require approved fixed firefighting systems in the enginerooms of existing towing vessels. (The EMC, under court order, has equipped its existing vessels with fixed fire extinguishing systems.) Although the Scandia had a fire pump, it could only be operated from the pump in the lower engineroom. The crewmembers could not reach the lower engineroom because they could not even enter the smoke-filled fidley. (They needed to go down the stairway   Analysis  48  in the fidley to the lower engineroom, engage the clutch, and start the pump.) The Safety Board concludes that because the Scandia's fire pump could not be started from outside the engineroom, it could not be used for fighting this fire. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should implement the requirement in its NPRM that fire pumps on towing vessels also be operable from outside the engineroom. Neither the chief engineer, who led the firefighting, nor any other crewman was aware that the emergency remote shut-offs for the engineroom ventilation fans were just outside the fidley's aft door. The fans continued to supply the fire with fresh air, causing the fire to grow and spread rapidly. None of the crewmen activated the remote fuel pump or fuel valve shut-offs to the engineroom, which were also outside the aft door of the fidley. Basic marine firefighting requires that all ventilation and fuel supply to the engineroom be shut off in the event of an engineroom fire. Although the chief engineer had completed a Coast-Guard-approved basic firefighting course, his statements to Safety Board investigators and his actions during the emergency show that he was not familiar with the location of the Scandia's emergency shut-offs. Although the crewmembers told Safety Board investigators that they had participated in emergency drills, they showed a lack of familiarity with the Scandia's emergency firefighting systems. None of the crew had participated in engineroom firefighting drills on the Scandia, and none had been assigned specific duties in the event of a fire emergency. The chief engineer was the only crewman who said he knew how to operate the Scandia's fire pump. The Safety Board supports the proposals in the NPRM about requiring muster lists, drills on using SCBAs and fireman's outfits, and safety orientations that will familiarize crewmembers with their vessel before they sail. The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should incorporate these proposals in its regulations. The Safety Board notes that it will be up to the vessel owners to comply with the regulations and that, for uninspected vessels, the Coast Guard intends to rely on spot checks rather than on an inspection program. Therefore, the Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should require vessel owners to keep detailed, signed logs of all on-board drills to assist the Coast Guard in its spot checks.  Risk Assessment--Summation. Because oil spill statistics from 1992 to 1996 show that oil barges spilled eight times more oil than tank ships, the Safety Board questions whether the Coast Guard's safety regulations for tug-barge systems are adequate when compared to those for tank vessels. A comparison of some of the fire safety regulations that are relevant to the Scandia accident shows that tank ships are subject to significantly higher safety regulations than tug-barge systems, although both carry similar cargoes. Regulatory   Analysis  49  differences in fire safety, as well as in other areas, such as vessel inspection and equipment redundancies, may explain why the pollution from tug-barges is so much greater than that from tank ships. If risks for tug-barge systems and tankers had been assessed with equal rigor, then the resulting regulations would probably have been comparable and would have provided an equivalent level of safety against pollution. Even though the RRAT conducted a risk assessment, based on which the Coast Guard issued the NPRM for improving tug-barge safety, the Board's investigation of this accident uncovered significant issues that were not addressed by the NPRM; thus, the proposed regulations may not be effective in reducing pollution. Even if the NPRM were adopted, it would not significantly reduce the overall regulatory discrepancy between tank vessels and tug-barges in many areas of safety, because the NPRM focuses only on safety issues relating to the Scandia accident. The Safety Board concludes that the large difference in the oil pollution data for the two vessel types quite likely results from the discrepancy in risk mitigation regulations that apply to them. The Coast Guard has both the authority and the responsibility to direct a comprehensive risk assessment to mitigate the effects of marine accidents on the public and the environment. The Safety Board therefore believes that the Coast Guard should conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to develop risk mitigation regulations for tugbarge systems that provide a level of safety against marine pollution equivalent to that provided by regulations for tankers.  Deployment of Coast Guard Rescue Boat The Coast Guard rescue boat crew lost 20 minutes in reaching the accident scene because the sea was unsafe for the 41-foot UTB, forcing the SAR crew to return for a 44foot MLB. The delay did not prevent the Coast Guard from rescuing the Scandia's crew. However, the delay allowed the fire to progress and caused a more dangerous situation to develop for the crewmembers while they waited for the Coast Guard to arrive. The delay also forced the SAR crew to conduct a more difficult in-the-water rescue because the wheelhouse windows on the tug had ""exploded"" by then, forcing the tug crew to enter the water. If the SAR crew had initially deployed in the MLB, the crew would have arrived 20 minutes sooner than it did, and the coxswain would been able to conduct a direct vessel-to-vessel transfer of the tug crew as he had earlier envisioned. With an out-of-thewater transfer, the swimmer would not have suffered from hypothermia, and the crew of the Scandia would have been exposed to less risk. The coxswain explained that he initially selected the UTB instead of the MLB because the UTB was significantly faster and more maneuverable and offered greater protection from the weather. The coxswain's points are valid, but he did not recognize that the wind and sea were too severe for a UTB until he was some distance out to sea.   Analysis  50  The coxswain made the decision to use a UTB instead of an MLB. According to the Coast Guard`s SAR plan, the selection of the boat is the responsibility of the officerin-charge (OIC) at the boat station. Because the OIC was not present at the time of the accident, it became the officer-on-duty's (OD's) responsibility. However, the OD did not give the coxswain any guidance about the type of boat to use. Although the coxswain morning, he did not check a m his knowledge of the weather When the coxswain launched, update. had ore on the seen a weather report posted at the station earlier that recent weather report at the station. Instead, he based what he could readily see from the station windows. duty watchstander did not supply the latest weather  In the Safety Board's opinion, the Coast Guard's procedures for deploying the proper boat were adequate. However, the Coast Guard station personnel did not adequately follow the procedures. For instance, the OD did not give the coxswain the necessary guidance for selecting the boat, and the coxswain failed to check the latest weather information. The Safety Board concludes that the OD and the coxswain did not consider the weather and sea conditions sufficiently in selecting the rescue boat, and the result was a 20-minute delay in arriving on scene. The Safety Board believes that Coast Guard stations should conduct a mandatory pre-deployment briefing for all SAR missions to ensure that the on-scene weather and sea conditions are assessed accurately so that the proper rescue boat is selected.  Hypothermia Protective Clothing The coxswain decided it was necessary to return to the station immediately so that the swimmer could be treated for hypothermia. The coxswain stated that had the swimmer not become hypothermic, the coxswain would have proceeded directly to the barge and attempted to drop its anchor before the weather worsened. Coast Guard procedures32 prescribing the use of hypothermia protective clothing specify that in cold-water areas, a surface swimmer should don either a wet suit or a dry suit and a safety harness en route to the scene of the accident if the coxswain or boat crew has prior knowledge that someone must be rescued from the water. The coxswain is responsible for selecting the swimmer from the boat crew. During the initial response to the Scandia, the coxswain did not tell the swimmer to outfit himself because the coxswain did not anticipate that a rescue from the water would be necessary. As a result, when the swimmer entered the water, he was wearing only anti-exposure coveralls, which were inadequate to protect him from hypothermia. In the Safety Board's opinion, it is likely that someone, either a Coast Guardsman or a civilian, will fall into the water during any small-boat rescue operation in rough seas. 32  U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Instruction M10470.10C ""Hypothermia Protective Clothing.""   Analysis  51  Therefore, the need for a swimmer to enter the water should always be anticipated under such conditions. Since it is extremely difficult to remove anti-exposure coveralls and don a dry or wet suit on a rolling and pitching small boat in rough seas, a pre-designated swimmer should don appropriate thermal protective garments before the boat leaves the station in cold-water areas. The Safety Board concludes that had the swimmer been properly attired, he probably would not have become hypothermic. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should establish and implement procedures to require a pre-designated swimmer to don suitable thermal protective clothing before launching a small boat on a SAR mission in cold water.  Decision to Return to Barge The Safety Board analyzed the group commander's decision to send a Coast Guard crew, along with two Scandia crewmen, to the North Cape to drop its anchor. This decision required an analysis of the potential risks of injury or death to the Coast Guard and civilian personnel, an assessment of the risk of loss of or damage to Coast Guard resources, and a judgment about the probability of success. The group commander learned that assistance from commercial tugs would not be available in time; consequently, he knew that using a tug to re-establish control over the drifting barge was no longer an option. Then, after the air station declined to provide a helicopter to deliver the two tug crewmen to the barge, the group commander decided to send the MLB to the barge. He said that he believed because of several factors that the mission was likely to succeed: the EMC had assured him that the crew was capable of dropping the anchor, the coxswain had agreed to deliver the crewmen to the barge, and the tug crewmen themselves were confident they could drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. Although the group commander believed he had made a reasonable decision, in the Safety Board's view, the decision was based on incomplete facts and was not fully justified. Even though the EMC told the group commander that the tug crew could drop the anchor, the EMC did not fully understand either the condition of the surf in which the attempt would be made or the condition of the anchoring gear on the barge. The EMC had no knowledge of the limitations of the Coast Guard vessel or of the stress on the crew. While the EMC's advice may have been well intended, it was based upon incomplete knowledge of the conditions and should not have been a basis upon which the group commander made his decision. Although the coxswain agreed to the group commander's decision, the coxswain had no way of knowing that the sea and weather had become much more dangerous or that the barge would be in the surf when he arrived on scene. According to the group commander, the return trip to the barge would not have been attempted without the coxswain's consent. However, it is possible that the coxswain was so tired from having   Analysis  52  just completed a strenuous rescue operation in rough seas that he may have been incapable of accurately judging his own fitness for continued duty. The chief engineer and mate of the Scandia both volunteered to return to the barge and believed that they could be successfully drop the anchor within 5 minutes of boarding the barge. However, neither man knew what condition the anchoring equipment would be in when they boarded the barge or had any information about how treacherous the onscene conditions had become. Their belief that they could accomplish the task quickly was more a matter of wishful thinking than a matter of fact. Thus, the three criteria on which the group commander based his decision were little more than opinions with no basis in fact. Of particular concern to the Board was his decision to place civilian lives at risk to conduct this dangerous mission. The Safety Board, therefore, concludes that although the coxswain, the Coast Guard boat crew, and the tug crew volunteers made a heroic attempt to prevent an oil spill, the decision to allow them to do so was ill-conceived and not justified. The Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod had informed the group commander that the air station would not provide a helicopter to deliver anyone to the barge because aviation risk assessment criteria specify that SAR personnel should only be placed at risk if human lives are in danger. When the group commander proceeded with the salvage mission, he did not tell the air station. Had he told the air station, its personnel may have reviewed the criteria for launching and may have made a decision not to place civilian and Coast Guard personnel at unnecessary risk. While the group commander thought he had assessed the risks fully before he ordered the attempt to drop the barge anchor, in the Safety Board's view he had not. He did not fully recognize the severity of the sea and weather conditions or anticipate that another life-threatening rescue would be necessitated as a result of the dangers encountered by the salvage crew. Such an assessment has been identified in previous Safety Board investigations. As a result of its investigation of the 1991 capsizing and sinking of the U.S. commercial fishing vessel Sea King,33 the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation M-92-54 to the Coast Guard: Incorporate into the training of SAR personnel procedures to ensure the gathering and dissemination of pertinent information by all appropriate SAR personnel to facilitate a thorough assessment of the potential risks to persons involved in a SAR mission. As the result of the investigation of three 1993 accidents34 involving Coast Guard SAR responses that proved unsuccessful because of the inadequacy of the risk For more information, read Marine Accident Report--Capsizing and Sinking of the U.S. Fishing Vessel Sea King Near Astoria, Oregon, January 11, 1991 (NTSB/MAR-92/05). 34 33  For more information, read Marine Accident Brief Reports--Grounding of the U.S. Sailing Pleasure   Analysis  53  assessments, the Safety Board issued Safety Recommendation M-94-7 to the Coast Guard: Provide risk assessment training to all Coast Guard personnel directly involved in SAR missions. On November 21, 1994, the Coast Guard Commandant stated: I concur with these recommendations. The Coast Guard has taken action to add risk assessment training for SAR personnel at appropriate levels in the operational chain of command, and full implementation is expected by May of 1995. The Commandant's response further indicated that, as a result of the Board's recommendations, risk assessment training had been included in training courses for small-boat coxswains, for pilots and aircrews, for small-boat station commanders, for cutter commanders and executive officers, for operations-center watchstanders, and for group and station commanding officers and executive officers. As a result of the Commandant's response, Safety Recommendations M-92-54 and M-94-7 were classified ""Closed--Acceptable Action."" While the Safety Board is gratified that the Coast Guard has incorporated risk assessment training in the training for all levels of SAR activity, from small-boat coxswain to group commander, training in and of itself does not ensure that proper risk assessments will be made in all cases. To be truly effective, training must be reinforced by pertinent operational guidelines. According to the pilot of the second rescue helicopter, the operations officer at the air station declined to provide helicopter assistance for the salvage mission after consulting personnel from the Group. The request was denied because the formal risk assessment guidelines, which are in the Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710, Air Operations Manual, prohibit the placing of a Coast Guard helicopter and air crew at grave risk for any operation, such as a salvage mission, that is not a life-threatening emergency. (The risk of losing the aircraft or the air crew is considered a grave risk.) The group commander did not have any comparable published formal risk assessment guidelines to follow in making his assessment of the risks presented by the salvage operation. In the Board's opinion, it is just as necessary to provide guidelines for placing Coast Guard surface craft and surface personnel at ""grave risk"" as it is to provide such guidelines for aircraft and aviation personnel. The guidelines should clearly explain the procedures for conducting risk assessments and analyses that are necessary before conducting SAR and salvage missions, for identifying grave risk to surface craft and personnel, and for obtaining concurrence and approval from the respective district commands. In particular, the guidelines should emphasize the need to protect civilian Craft Rite of Passage, Isle of Palms, South Carolina, August 4, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-023); Sinking of the U.S. Pleasure Craft Big Abalone, Coos Bay, Oregon, August 20, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-029); and Sinking of the U.S. Tug Duke Luedtke, in Lake Erie, Near Cleveland, Ohio, September 21, 1993 (DCA-93-MM-030).   Analysis  54  lives from unnecessary ""grave risk."" The Safety Board concludes that developing and implementing risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface SAR units that are similar to those for the deployment of aircraft would enhance the quality of risk assessments by Coast Guard operational commanders. The Safety Board, therefore, believes that the Coast Guard should develop and implement risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface SAR units that are similar to those published in Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710.  Coxswain's Decision to Leave Mate on Barge After returning to the scene, the chief engineer and the mate successfully boarded the barge. After their attempt to drop the anchor had failed, the coxswain was able to retrieve only the chief engineer. The coxswain spent about half an hour attempting to maneuver the MLB near the barge so that he could retrieve the mate, but he was unable to do so because the sea had worsened considerably. He was faced with an extremely difficult decision in weighing the dangers faced by his crew and vessel against the safety of the stranded crewman. The coxswain realized that the MLB was at risk of capsizing in the rough surf and that some of the MLB's electronic equipment was functioning erratically because of the rough seas. He asked for a Coast Guard helicopter to rescue the stranded crewman. He then left because there was nothing more that he could do other than endanger his vessel and crew. The Safety Board concludes that the coxswain's decision to leave after asking for a rescue helicopter for the stranded crewman was reasonable, considering the need to protect his own crew and vessel and his inability to retrieve the crewman.  Pollution Response Because the weather was rough enough to move the oil deflection booms from their intended locations and to hamper cleanup activities, some oil seeped into environmentally sensitive areas, resulting in a significant short-term impact on the fishing grounds and local fisheries. Because the spilled oil was light grade, much of it weathered and evaporated into the atmosphere under the action of sunlight and the turbulent waves, as demonstrated by the tests conducted by the EPA 5 days later, which showed that the level of petroleum hydrocarbon was well below the level considered harmful to marine life. Most of the remaining oil was corralled by the floating booms and mechanically skimmed from the surface by vacuum hoses. However, NOAA is still assessing the degree of long-term environmental damage, including the impact on fish and bird populations, which are expected to need several years to return to the numbers they had reached before the accident. As required by the area contingency plan, the responsible governmental agencies, parties, and environmental cleanup resources were notified soon after the crew abandoned the tug that a major oil spill was anticipated. Consequently, pollution cleanup resources were being transported to the scene well before the North Cape's tanks were breached.   Analysis  55  The Safety Board concludes that the notifications and the pollution cleanup response were adequate, considering the adverse weather following the accident.   56  Conclusions  Findings 1. Drugs, fatigue, and crew qualifications were not causal to this accident. 2. The fire on the Scandia originated near the center of the fidley grating, which was above the main engine exhaust manifold. 3. Rough seas may have caused a container of flammable lubricant to fall onto the part of the engine manifold that had loose insulation, where the lubricant ignited on contact; however, the cause of the fire could not be precisely determined. 4. The Eklof Marine Corporation's oversight of vessel maintenance for its fleet was inadequate, and the implementation of its vessel inspection program was ineffective. 5. Because the Eklof Marine Corporation did not have adequate voyage planning procedures to ensure that adequate weather information and operational precautions were considered in its decisionmaking, the risk reduction measures that could have been taken before the voyage began were not taken. 6. The use of a tug assistance system in conjunction with a barge retrieval system would have significantly improved the chance of arresting the drift of the North Cape and preventing its grounding. 7. An operable anchor may have reduced the chance of the barge grounding. 8. When a tug is disabled, modern devices, such as radio-frequency transmitters, that are suitably located on the tug may be effective in releasing the barge's anchor by remote control, and the use of such transmitters does not involve imposing risks on the crew. 9. The Scandia accident demonstrates the need for self-contained breathing apparatus and firesuits on towing vessels. 10. The Coast Guard's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposes a lower level of safety for existing tugs than for new tugs and would not make existing tugs any safer from the kind of fire that the Scandia experienced in this accident. 11. Because the Scandia's fire pump could not be started from outside the engineroom, it could not be used for fighting this fire. 12. The large difference in the oil pollution data for tug-barge systems and tankers quite likely resulted from the discrepancy in risk mitigation regulations that apply to them.   Conclusions  57  13. The Coast Guard officer-on-duty and the coxswain did not consider the weather and sea conditions sufficiently in selecting the rescue boat, and the result was a 20-minute delay in arriving on scene. 14. Had the surface swimmer been properly attired, he probably would not have become hypothermic. 15. Although the coxswain, the Coast Guard boat crew, and the tug crew volunteers made an heroic attempt to prevent an oil spill, the decision to allow them to do so was illconceived and not justified. 16. Developing and implementing risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface search and rescue units that are similar to the guidelines for the deployment of aircraft would enhance the quality of risk assessments by Coast Guard operational commanders. 17. The coxswain's decision to leave after asking for a rescue helicopter for the stranded crewman was reasonable, considering his need to protect his own crew and vessel and his inability to retrieve the crewman. 18. The notifications and the pollution cleanup response were adequate, considering the adverse weather following the accident.  Probable Cause The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the fire damage aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of and pollution from the barge North Cape was the Eklof Marine Corporation's inadequate oversight of maintenance and operations aboard those vessels, which permitted a fire of unknown origin to become catastrophic and eliminated any realistic possibility of arresting the subsequent drift and grounding of the barge. Contributing to the accident was the lack of adequate Coast Guard and industry standards addressing towing vessel safety.   58  Recommendations As a result of this accident, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the following safety recommendations: to the U.S. Coast Guard: Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to develop risk mitigation regulations for tug-barge systems that provide a level of safety against marine pollution equivalent to that provided by regulations for tankers. (M-98-103) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop and implement an effective safety management code to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. (M-98-104) Require towing vessel companies to develop and implement procedures whereby management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. (M-98-105) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop and implement requirements for voyage planning standards and checklists for towing vessel companies to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. (M-98-106) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry in the northeastern United States, institute a pilot project to evaluate the benefits of using an organized tug-assistance system to complement the proposed barge retrieval system or, if appropriate, develop and implement an alternative system to ensure barge retrieval if a tug becomes incapable of performing that function. (M-98-107) In conjunction with the towing vessel industry, develop modern remote anchor release devices for barges in emergencies that do not expose crewmen to unnecessary risk, and require their utilization. (M-98-108) Require self-contained breathing apparatus and firesuits aboard all towing vessels, as well as training in their use. (M-98-109) Require approved fixed firefighting systems in the enginerooms of existing towing vessels.

(M-98-111) Require that towing vessels have muster lists, drills on the use of selfcontained breathing apparatus and fireman's outfits, and safety orientations to familiarize crewmembers with their vessel before sailing. (M-98-112) Require vessel owners to keep detailed, signed logs of all on-board drills to assist the Coast Guard in its spot checks. (M-98-113) Require Coast Guard station search and rescue personnel to conduct a mandatory pre-deployment briefing for all search and rescue missions to ensure that the on-scene weather and sea conditions are assessed accurately so that the proper rescue boat is selected. (M-98-114) Establish and implement procedures to require a pre-designated swimmer to don suitable thermal protective clothing before launching in a small boat on a search and rescue mission in cold water. (M-98-115) Develop and implement risk assessment guidelines for the deployment of surface search and rescue units similar to the guidelines published in Coast Guard Commandant's Instruction 3710. (M-98-116) to Eklof Marine Corporation: Develop and implement an effective management oversight program that provides maintenance managers with enough information to track maintenance trends and to make informed maintenance decisions that will ensure the safety of the company's fleet and crews. (M-98-117) Develop and implement procedures whereby designated management officials communicate with ship captains at sea in times of potential or actual emergencies and during safety-critical periods of a voyage. (M-98-118) Develop and implement voyage planning procedures and checklists for your towing vessels to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of operational precautions. (M-98-119) to American Waterways Operators, Inc.: Develop an effective safety management code for your member companies to implement to ensure adequate management oversight of the maintenance and operation of vessels involved in oil transportation by barges. (M-98-120)   Recommendations  60  Encourage your member towing vessel companies to develop and implement voyage planning standards and checklists to ensure that adequate risk reduction measures are taken before starting a voyage, including an assessment of weather risks, of the adequacy of the vessel's equipment, and of the operational precautions. (M-99-121) In cooperation with the Coast Guard, develop a means of releasing anchors on unmanned towed barges by remote control from the towing vessel. (M-98-122) BY THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD  JAMES E. HALL Chairman ROBERT T. FRANCIS II Vice Chairman  JOHN A. HAMMERSCHMIDT Member JOHN J. GOGLIA Member GEORGE W. BLACK, JR. Member  July 14, 1998  Vice Chairman Robert T. Francis submitted the following statement: I have concurred in the probable cause of this accident because I believe it adequately addresses the chain of events that ultimately led to the fire aboard the tug Scandia and the subsequent grounding of the Scandia and the tank barge North Cape. However, I can not concur in our criticism of the U.S. Coast Guard coxswain of Station Point Judith for his choice of the 41-foot utility boat for the initial response for the rescue of the crewmembers of the Scandia. The report acknowledges valid reasons for the coxswain's initial choicethe utility boat was significantly faster, more maneuverable, and offered greater protection from the weather for the crew and, presumably, for the six rescued passengers from the Scandia tug. According to our investigation, the multi-mission, 41-foot utility boat is used most often to perform most missions, although the 44-foot motor life boat is available for more difficult sea conditions. The coxswain's decision to take the faster and more agile boat to rescue civilians in serious, life-threatening and immediate danger comported not only with the experience of the coxswain and station command, but also with the Coast Guard's procedures for deploying the appropriate boatprocedures that the Safety Board finds to be ""adequate.""   Recommendations  61  Of necessity, our accident investigation process reviews actions taken in such incidents with 20-20 hindsight, which enables the Safety Board to make considered decisions and thoughtful recommendations. However, I can not concur in the use of this distant and cool review to criticize the coxswain's decisions made under immediate, urgent, and critical circumstances on which the lives of the crew of the Scandia depended. The coxswain could have been better informed about the current weather and sea conditions before he left Station Point Judith. Yet, his decisions, the assembly of the duty boat crew, and the launch for the rescue operation all occurred within approximately 5 minutes. I am reluctant to criticize that sort of timeliness where lives are at stake. And, while outcome-determinative analysis is not desirable for Safety Board investigations, this mission was successfulthe crew of the Scandia was rescued and the crew of the Station Point Judith 44-foot motor life boat all returned to the station despite the 20minute delay to return to the station for the 44-foot motor life boat. The Coast Guard performs the difficult and dangerous job of search and rescue admirably. For the Coast Guard, the answer to the question of initiating a search and rescue operation on our Nation's waters is not ""whether"" but ""when."" I want to ensure that our investigation and report here do not discourage prudent, courageous action or dampen the enthusiasm and commitment of those who choose to serve in the U.S. Coast Guard.   this page intentionally left blank   63  Appendix The National Transportation Safety Board was notified of this accident on January 19, 1996. Four investigators from the Safety Board's Washington, D.C., headquarters were dispatched to the scene, arriving on January 20. Investigators met with representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, with local emergency response agencies, and with the operator of the Scandia and arranged to board the grounded tug as soon as possible. Sworn testimony was taken from the crew of the Scandia and from relevant Coast Guard personnel between January 22 and January 25. The barge North Cape was boarded and examined after the pollution abatement activities were completed and the vessel had been towed to a safe location. The initial on-scene investigation was completed on January 26. Eklof Marine Corporation (EMC) (operator of the Scandia and the North Cape) and the U.S. Coast Guard were parties in the investigation. The Safety Board investigated the accident under the authority of the Independent Safety Board Act of 1997 under Safety Board rules. In September 1997, the EMC and affiliates, the president of the EMC, and the captain of the Scandia pled guilty to a series of State and Federal criminal charges of having been negligent in the operation of the Scandia and its tow. The pleas were the culmination of a coordinated criminal investigation involving the U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Attorney General, in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Coast Guard participated. Those who pled guilty admitted that the firefighting apparatus was inadequate, that operating the tow without a serviceable anchor had jeopardized safe operation, and that the vessels had been poorly maintained and operated in weather for which they were unfit. Additionally, they admitted to giving misleading information to Safety Board investigators. The Safety Board's investigation was deferred until the defendants were sentenced in January 1998, after which additional testimony was obtained from the EMC. The EMC agreed to pay $8.5 million in fines for spilling oil and causing substantial harm to the marine environment. In addition, the EMC agreed to undertake the following $1 million remedial safety program:   Install Coast Guard-approved, remotely operated, fixed CO2 fire suppression systems in the enginerooms of its tugs and tankers. Equip each towing vessel with two fireman's outfits and SCBAs and start a company program to train and periodically drill its vessel captains and crews in the proper use of firefighting equipment.   Appendix  64     Install operable anchors and windlasses on all its barges. Accept a court-approved consultant to oversee the implementation of these measures.  In February 1998, the EMC told Safety Board investigators that, in addition to implementing the directives ordered by the courts, the company is in the process of setting up a personal computer-based system that will keep records of vessel maintenance and repairs in the future. In February 1998, the Safety Board resumed its investigation by re-interviewing EMC personnel about vessel maintenance. No ""at risk"" testimony on vessel maintenance obtained in January 1996 has been used in this report. Only those parts of eyewitness testimony from the crew that were not contradicted by information from other sources have been retained in this report. Use of eyewitness testimony was necessary for describing the sequence of accident events and for maintaining continuity in the report. The use of the eyewitness testimony did not affect the validity of the analysis in this report. The report is based on the information developed as a result of the investigation and on additional analysis done by the Safety Board. The Safety Board has considered all facts in the investigative record that are pertinent to the Board's statutory responsibility to determine the cause or probable cause of the accident and to make recommendations.   65  Acronyms and Abbreviations  AB able-bodied seaman ABS American Bureau of Shipping AST Atlantic Strike Team AWO American Waterways Operators air station Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod CBBT Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel CFR Code of Federal Regulations DEM Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management EMC Eklof Marine Corporation EPA Environmental Protection Agency FleetWeather FleetWeather Ocean Services FOSC Federal on-scene coordinator IMO International Martime Organization ISM International Safety Management MLB motor life boat MMD merchant mariner's document MRO medical review officer NOAA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NPRM notice of proposed rulemaking NWS National Weather Service OD officer-on-duty OIC officer-in-charge OPA 90 Oil Pollution Act of 1990 POLREPs pollution response and notification activities RCP responsible carrier program RRAT regional risk assessment team SAR search and rescue SCBA self-contained breathing apparatus SITREP situation report SMIBs safety marine information broadcasts station Coast Guard Station Point Judith TOS tug of opportunity system   Acronyms and Abbreviations  66  TSAC UTB UTV VIP  Towing Safety Advisory Committee utility boat uninspected towing vessel vessel inspection program"
GX010-49-11768728	Final Recommendations To The Commissioner           Bureau of Motor Vehicles   Driver Evaluation Task Force       Testing Procedures and Screening Protocols for Detecting Impairments That Affect Driver Performance      Submitted August 24, 1999   Alvin Hayes, Chair        Background and Summary    In February, 1999, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles Commissioner Gary A. Gibson announced the formation of the BMV Driver Evaluation Task Force. The task force was created to review existing laws and regulatory procedures for the purpose of recommending modifications that will enable the Bureau to more accurately detect the presence of an impairment that could affect a person’s ability to operate a motor vehicle. Task force members were guided by the Commissioner’s preference for policies that are age neutral. This report contains the final recommendations from the BMV Driver Evaluation Task Force.  The task force met seven times between February 24 and July 3, 1999. During its five-month tenure, the task force reviewed regulatory protocols from driver licensing agencies in Indiana and other states. The panel solicited opinions and research from leading experts in the fields of optometry, psychology, geriatric medicine, physical therapy and other relevant disciplines. As well, task force members reviewed statistical data and reports from state, federal and private traffic safety agencies.  Following its review of relevant information, the task force debated a variety of recommendations to be offered to the commissioner. The issue of age-based testing or screening methods divided the group. All proposals involving age-based testing or screening were decided by slim margins and nearly all proposals using age-based criteria were defeated. After consideration of the recommendations, members approved five proposals. These proposals represent a significant departure from previous BMV policies in that they avoid using age-based qualifying criteria.  The task force expressed interest in new testing protocols and procedures that are being tested in other states. During several task force presentations, cognitive testing and initial screening protocols were presented as alternatives to traditional evaluation tools. While members found these new methods to be worthy of serious consideration, the task force concluded more testing is needed to verify that these screening tools are reliable in a field office environment.  Task force recommendations are subject to review and approval by the commissioner.  In August, 1999 the Bureau will allow Indiana citizens to comment on the task force recommendations during public hearings to be held in Indianapolis, South Bend and Evansville, Indiana. These hearings will assist the Commissioner in assessing public opinion. Once the Commissioner completes his review of the task force recommendations and comments expressed during the public hearings, the following steps will be required to enact any or all of the proposals:      Adoption by the Commissioner;     Promulgation of rules and regulations by the Bureau where a proposal is permitted under the Indiana Code; or     Approval by the Indiana General Assembly, if a proposal is not currently authorized under the Indiana Code.                Policy Recommendations    TERMINATION OF AGE-BASED DRIVE TESTS -  The task force recommended that the Bureau  should not  reinstate its requirement that Indiana driver license renewal applicants aged 75 and older take a driver skills test. This procedure was discontinued on December 5, 1998, after the Commissioner released a finding that neither the Indiana Code nor the Indiana Administrative Code grants authority to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to require testing for a driver license renewal applicant based on that person’s age.  Opinions were nearly evenly divided regarding the issue of age-based testing. A majority of task force members favored discontinuing age-based testing because of the following factors:      Americans Leading Longer, Healthier Lives . Improvements in health care, pharmaceuticals, and other quality of life factors have delayed the onset of physical and mental impairments that could negatively affect driver performance.      Low Drive Test Failure Rate.  Fewer than 10 percent of driver license renewal applicants fail the driver skills test. A majority of task force members concluded that the low failure rate indicated that the skills test is unnecessary in a majority of cases. BMV driver examiners told the task force that failure rates do not show significant change until a driver reaches 85 years of age.      Improvements in Testing, Screening Techniques.  There are increasing numbers of researchers who are developing new testing procedures, screening protocols and technology that can be applied by driver licensing agencies to determine driver fitness. These screening tools are gaining acceptance among leading state and federal driving regulators as being reliable and accurate predictors of driver impairments. As a result, task force members consider it preferable for the Bureau to conduct driver impairment screening procedures where advisable in lieu of mandatory driver skills tests, with age as the sole qualifying criteria.      Age-Based Testing Not Fair.  Some members oppose age as a qualifying factor for screening drivers as age is not a reliable predictor of driving ability, in their opinion. Although drivers ages 75 and older may be overrepresented among persons involved in traffic collisions, an individual driver should not be categorized based on a statistical category.     A minority of task force members opposed the prevailing recommendation regarding age-based drive testing. Those members expressed the following concerns:          Risk of Driver Impairments Increase With Driver Age  The minority task force view holds that age is not a predictor of driver performance, but as there is no method available for the Bureau to proactively screen drivers for impairments prior to a collision or other incident, age-based skills tests will prevent accidents.      Accident Rates -  State and federal statistics indicate that drivers over age 75 have the highest collision rates of any age group except for persons under age 21.         REQUIRE DRIVE TESTING BASED ON DRIVER PERFORMANCE -  The task force voted to replace age-based testing with a screening procedure that is based on driver performance. This recommendation requires any driver, regardless of age, to submit to a drive test after exceeding an unspecified number of accidents, driver license points or traffic convictions. By adopting this requirement, the task force would establish a new state policy that makes operator performance as the primary criteria that requires a driver to submit to the Bureau’s screening and evaluation process.  This proposal was presented as a counterproposal to the Bureau’s previous testing requirement for drivers aged 75 and older. A majority of task force members favored this type of screening criteria because it is perceived to be age-neutral and fair to all drivers. If this procedure is adopted, a commissioner’s designee (e.g., the BMV Point Study Commission) would have to establish a minimum standard for convictions, accidents and/or license points that would generate a mandatory drive test requirement prior to promulgating new regulations.  REFERRALS FROM PUBLIC WITH IMMUNITY FROM LIABILITY -  Currently, the Bureau accepts written referrals from the public citing specific unsafe behavior or medical condition that poses a traffic safety risk. However, some task force members suggested that many medical professionals may not report an impairment that may affect a person’s driving ability because such action might be considered a breach of patient confidentiality.  Task force members expressed an interest in adopting measures that would increase reporting of physical and mental impairments by medical professionals. Therefore, the task force recommended the state adopt rules that would protect physicians, nurses, psychiatrists and other health workers from legal action resulting from a medical professional reporting information about a patient’s driving impairment.  ADOPT PERIPHERAL VISION STANDARD -  Adding a peripheral vision standard was the third task force recommendation. Currently, the Bureau conducts a vision screening that only measures a driver’s visual acuity. Several experts suggested that a peripheral vision standard is a necessary component for effective driver screening. This proposal was the only recommendation that was unanimously approved.  ESTABLISH TASK FORCE TO EXPLORE YOUNGER DRIVER ISSUES -  Some task force members expressed concern that the task force did not address issues specific to drivers under age 18. Factors that cause collisions in which a younger driver is involved include a lack of structured driver training, poor decision making, risk-taking behavior and driver immaturity. While the task force acknowledged that Indiana lawmakers recently approved a Probationary Driver license statute that restricts operating privileges for persons ages 16-18, members said additional measures are needed that provide training and improve decision-making capacity.  The task force suggested that a panel should be created to study critical issues involving younger drivers, which includes behavior patterns, statistical data, new technology and screening procedures, judicial and administrative policies in other states and other methods that would help the Bureau identify young problem drivers.  ESTABLISH PILOT SCREENING AND EVALUATION PROJECT -  The task force reviewed a wide variety of research projects and technology-based tools that have been designed to assist state agencies in screening driver licensing applicants for physical and mental impairments. Currently, none of these tools are being used for regulatory purposes by a driver licensing agency.  The only state agency that is using the new technology-based screening tools is Maryland’s Motor Vehicle Administration. The agency is participating in a pilot project, sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is designed to test the validity of the screening and evaluation tools in a license branch environment. To date, no information is available regarding the success of the pilot project, and which, if any, of the screening and evaluation tools should be used.  However, task force members agreed that the Bureau should conduct its own pilot study to measure the effectiveness of screening and evaluation tools. The task force suggested that the pilot project should be conducted based on the following criteria:       The study should be conducted for a period of two years;      Persons ages 75 and older should be required to participate in the study;      Normal regulatory provisions would be applicable to the results of an applicant’s screening procedure (e.g., if a possible impairment is discovered, the applicant would have to submit to a driver skill test or a physician would be required to provide a report regarding the applicant’s condition. )      The project should be monitored by an independent panel of physicians and scientists.
GX107-69-16304086	"Testimony of   Jim Hall, Chairman   National Transportation Safety Board   before the   Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure   Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation   House of Representatives   Regarding   Coast Guard Search and Rescue Communications   November 3, 1999         Good morning Chairman Gilchrest and members of the Committee.  It is a pleasure to represent the National Transportation Safety Board before you today regarding the subject of Coast Guard search and rescue (SAR) communications.       The Coast Guard’s 1998 Annual Report states that ""The Coast Guard seeks to save all mariners in imminent danger.""  And, they have a good record of achieving that goal.  In 1998, the Coast Guard responded to approximately 38,700 distress calls and saved more than 4,000 lives.  However, in December 1997, the distress call from the 34-foot recreational sailing vessel  Morning Dew  was not responded to, and the lives of the four individuals aboard were not saved.  The Safety Board’s investigation of that accident found serious deficiencies in the Coast Guard’s communication system.  My testimony will focus on those findings and our recommendations to correct the problems we found.     In addition to the accident involving the  Morning Dew,  the Safety Board has investigated five additional marine accidents involving Coast Guard communications since 1993.        August 4, 1993  – At 12:08 a.m., the operator of the sailing vessel  Rite of Passage  notified the Coast Guard that the vessel was disabled near the Isle of Palms, South Carolina, with engine problems and that he needed assistance.  Believing that the operator was in no immediate danger, the watchstander classified the incident as a non-distress situation, issued a marine assistance request, and a local towing company advised that they would respond.  At 1:00 a.m., the Coast Guard received a telephone call from the Isle of Palms Police Department reporting that an unidentified sailing vessel was aground and listing badly.  The Coast Guard then dispatched a 41-foot utility boat to respond to what was thought to be a second vessel in distress. At 5:50 a.m., a local rescue squad recovered the operator’s body from the surf.  If the watchstander had asked the operator the questions on the SAR checklist, he would have learned that the operator was a 67-year-old man with a heart condition requiring medication, and may have increased the urgency of the situation and indicated a need for an immediate Coast Guard response.     August 21, 1994  – A disabled 18-foot Questar motorboat with the vessel’s owner and one passenger on board capsized while being towed by the Coast Guard Auxiliary vessel  Puppet  near Juneau, Alaska, resulting in one fatality.  Events surrounding this accident suggest that the SAR response was hampered by the undisciplined use of VHF-FM channel 16 by participants in a fishing derby.  The Safety Board found that the Coast Guard made no attempt to minimize inappropriate use of channel 16 by the approximately 1,000 vessels participating in the fishing derby.  The sheer volume of inappropriate radio traffic on a channel that was supposed to be reserved for calling out and distress severely compromised the Coast Guard’s ability to receive and respond to distress calls.  As a result of this accident, the Safety Board issued recommendations to the Coast Guard regarding radio reception capability, the use of Coast Guard Auxiliary resources, SAR policies, and post-accident toxicological testing of Coast Guard Auxiliary personnel.       April 14, 1995  – An 18-foot-long Thunderbird Cheyenne motorboat capsized in about 16 feet of water, in Oswego, New York, resulting in the deaths of all three occupants.  Another boater saw the capsized vessel and reported the sighting and the location to someone at a local marina.  The marina operator called Coast Guard Station Oswego and relayed the report.  The watchstander at Station Oswego notified the duty officer of the call, but the duty officer decided that no immediate action should be taken.  The boat was found the next day by a local law enforcement marine patrol boat after the boat was reported overdue.     June 13, 1998  – A distress call from the recreational boat  Florida Air Specialist,  which was in Apalachee Bay, Florida, for recreational fishing with three people on board ,  was logged by Coast Guard Auxiliary watchstanders as a hoax.  The Coast Guard did not initiate a review of the recorded radio communications until after the only survivor of the accident reported that a distress call had been transmitted.  Had no one survived the  Florida Air  accident, the Coast Guard may not have known that the distress call had been made.  The investigation into this accident is on going.     January 18, 1999  – About noon, the  Adriatic , with four people on board, completed clam harvesting operations and began the trip from the fishing grounds off the coast of Long Beach Island, New Jersey to Atlantic City, New Jersey.  At about 2:58 p.m., the operator radioed a mayday to the Coast Guard.  Watchstanders from three units converged onto the airwaves all within the first few seconds, overlapping one another.  In addition, another Coast Guard unit made an unscheduled marine information broadcast at the same moment the call outs were initiated.   All four people are missing from this vessel.  The Board’s investigation is on going.     Like these accidents, the  Morning Dew  tragedy involved Coast Guard communications.  The Safety Board was first informed about this accident in April 1998, when several Members of Congress asked that we conduct an independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident, and to review the Coast Guard's actions following the accident.  I want to point out that under our current agreement with the Coast Guard, we were not initially informed about the accident because it did not meet the notification criteria.      As a result of the Congressional requests, we proceeded to conduct an extensive marine accident investigation.  More than 35 witnesses were interviewed, and extensive factual information was gathered from the Coast Guard, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), the Charleston Pilots Association, the Charleston Coroner, and family members of the victims.  We also contracted with the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center to survey the communications system serving Coast Guard Group Charleston, including two subordinate stations and six antenna high sites stretching from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Savannah, Georgia.  The Navy also transcribed more than 300 hours of radio and telephone communications recorded at the Charleston station.  In addition, the Board held a public hearing in Charleston in February 1999.  The final report was discussed at the October 5, 1999, Board meeting.     The Accident Investigation     The owner of the  Morning Dew  was moving the vessel from a marina near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, via the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), and had purchased the appropriate charts for that trip.  The group on board, comprised of the owner, his two sons, ages 16 and 13, and his 14-year-old nephew, got underway a little after noon on December 27, 1997.   On the afternoon of December 28, 1997, in Winya Bay, South Carolina, the  Morning Dew  was seen proceeding outbound in the main shipping channel, past the entrance to the ICW, and toward the open ocean.      In order for the  Morning Dew  to exit the bay and reach the open ocean, it had to continue in or near the shipping channel for about seven miles, during which time the boat would pass 12 or more channel markers before reaching the mouth of the bay.  Once there, the vessel had to navigate past a 2.2-mile-long jetty before turning right to follow a southwesterly course, along the coast, toward Charleston, South Carolina, about 43 miles away.       From all available evidence, just after 2:00 a.m., the  Morning Dew  struck the north side of the north rock jetty extending from the harbor at Charleston.  The paint markings and debris path documented by the SCDNR show that the vessel was carried over the jetty, probably by waves in combination with the rising tide, resulting in the vessel’s coming to rest submerged in about 12 feet of water on the south side of the jetty.       At 2:17 a.m., a Coast Guard Group Charleston communications watchstander received a static-filled radio message -- the only words he heard were ""U.S. Coast Guard.""  Although he tried to raise someone on the radio, he received no response.  Despite having the capability to do so, the watchstander did not replay the recording of the message to determine the nature of the call, nor did he wake his duty officer.  Much later, when the tape was finally replayed, the voice of an excited adolescent male was heard saying ""May ... mayday, U.S. Coast Guard come in.""        About 6:20 a.m., the boatswain of the inbound freighter  Pearl Ace  reported hearing cries for help coming from the water near buoy 22 as the ship entered Charleston Harbor. He immediately reported it by radio to the master on the bridge, and the pilot in turn contacted the pilot dispatcher and asked him to relay the information to the Coast Guard.  The pilot also asked the operator of the pilot boat  Palmetto State  to search the area where the calls for help had been heard.  The search by the  Palmetto State  was unsuccessful.     When the Coast Guard duty officer was contacted regarding the cries for help he decided to take no action, even though Coast Guard resources were available to initiate a search.  He later told investigators that he thought the pilot boat could handle the situation.      A full Coast Guard search was not initiated until the bodies of two teenagers were discovered near the beach about 11:00 a.m. The other teenager was found soon after, and the owner was not found until about three weeks later.     Following the accident, the SCDNR initiated a death and boating safety investigation.  Despite an SCDNR request to the Coast Guard regarding possible distress calls, the Coast Guard was not forthcoming with information because they were conducting an administrative investigation into the watchstander's actions.  In fact, although Coast Guard officials were aware of the mayday call on the evening of December 29, 1997, no one outside the Coast Guard, including the SCDNR or the victims' families, was told about it for more than 2 1/2 months.  That failure hampered the SCDNR's investigation. The information regarding the distress call was not released by the Coast Guard until  Boating News  filed a Freedom of Information Act request in February 1998.       Mr. Chairman, the results of the Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident were distressing, particularly with regard to the following areas:  the need to upgrade Coast Guard SAR communications equipment; the adequacy of watchstander duty time, and the need to upgrade watchstander procedures for responding to an emergency; the need for additional training for communications watchstanders; and the lack of investigation coordination.     SAR Communications      The Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  accident sought to evaluate the equipment resources available to the Coast Guard communication center watchstanders when they receive a call for assistance from a distressed mariner.  Specifically, we were interested in determining if the radio and recording equipment were adequate, and what means were available to the watchstander to locate a distressed boater when the boater did not or could not provide his location to the Coast Guard.  The Board contracted with the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to assist in this effort.  Unfortunately, a number of significant deficiencies with the communication systems at the Charleston and Mobile group offices, the only two offices surveyed, were found, and suggested that similar problems may exist throughout the Coast Guard.  Group Mobile was studied to provide another data point, and because of its connection with the  Florida Air Specialist  accident previously mentioned.      Operational testing on the direction finding (DF) equipment at group Charleston showed it was very inaccurate, had limited features, and thus was not being used.  This DF system was designed to only provide a line of bearing to, rather than the geographic location of, the transmitting radio.  In addition, it could not record the bearing information for later review and correlation to recorded audio transmissions.        The Navy’s assessment of the communication system included an evaluation of the audio recording equipment used in the Coast Guard’s communication centers.  We found that the recorders in use at Charleston and Mobile were difficult to operate when searching for specific recorded communications.  In addition, the recorders were not suitable for quickly replaying recently received messages.        Some antennas and towers needed maintenance, and there was no program to specifically inspect antenna towers.  A continuous frequency swept voltage standing wave ratio measurement, which can be used to document antenna bandwidth and identify nulls, had not been performed on the antennas.  The antenna at Mount Pleasant, which picked up the  Morning Dew  transmission, was found to be located on a tower along with several other commercial antennas, and tests found some interference from these other antennas at certain frequencies.  The noise levels on the telephone lines connecting the Charleston Group Communications Center to the antenna high sites were not being routinely monitored, and the quality of the telephone lines used to connect the group communications centers to the antenna high sites were less than optimum.     As a result of their findings, the Naval Surface Warfare Center recommended the following improvements to optimize the efficiency of the communication system:        Institute a programmed antenna maintenance program that would improve the early detection of faults;         Institute a frequency management program to reduce the possibility of signal interference from other transmitters;         Install a condition-based monitoring system that would provide continuous monitoring of remote equipment; and         Upgrade the class of telephone service to reduce the possibility of signal degradation through the existing phone lines.       Safety Board staff visited the Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, Canada for information about Canadian Coast Guard SAR communications.  We learned that the Prince Rupert radio station has been successfully using a commercially available DF system in SAR operations since 1992.  The Prince Rupert Station is one of three Canadian Marine Communications and Traffic Services stations that have radio DF equipment for use in SAR  cases.  These off-the-shelf commercial DF systems are reasonably priced and are currently being manufactured by several companies in the United States and elsewhere.       The officer-in-charge reported that the Canadian DF system is easy to use, accurate, and  capable of determining the geographic location of a transmitting radio to a distance of sixty to eighty miles through triangulation.  The system can also digitally record bearing information for later retrieval and analysis.  According to the Canadian Coast Guard, the DF system has reduced SAR response time by eliminating time-consuming searches for vessels in distress.  As soon as the station receives a transmission, it also knows the vessel’s location.  The system can locate vessels in distress when incomplete maydays are transmitted, and can provide navigation information to vessels lost in fog, and locate vessels with open microphones.  Because the equipment can also identify and locate a hoax caller, it has reduced nuisance calls and unnecessary SAR missions, resulting in a cost savings.      The Prince Rupert Marine Communications and Traffic Services Station also has recording equipment to record all incoming and outgoing radio communications.  The recording equipment consists of separate units for instant playback and for longer term archival recording. Unlike the equipment at Group Charleston, it allows for quick replay of a message if there is any doubt about its content.      The Safety Board is aware of the U.S. Coast Guard’s national distress and response system modernization project, which has been in various stages of development for 20 years.   Unfortunately, the initial operational capability is not scheduled until fiscal year 2003, and full operational capability will not be until the 2005-2006 timeframe.  In the interim, the Coast Guard intends to install new DF equipment at selected communication centers in areas having significant SAR activity, and has allocated $2 million in fiscal year 2000 for the procurement of the equipment.       It is our understanding that the interim DF equipment will be similar to equipment now in place at communication centers, and will only provide a line of bearing to the transmitting vessel and will not likely have the ability to record the DF data.  The Board believes that this equipment will not significantly improve the Coast Guard’s SAR response capability.      Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation requesting that the Coast Guard immediately provide all SAR communications centers with the capability for watchstanders to easily and instantly replay the most recent recorded radio transmissions, and that they immediately begin to equip all SAR communications centers with currently available, commercial, off-the-shelf DF systems that provide, at a minimum, the capability to establish a position fix and to record position data for later retrieval and analysis.     Group Charleston’s Personnel Duty Time, Equipment, and Procedures for Responding to an Emergency      The Board expressed concern that current Coast Guard duty policy does not provide redundancy for listening to communications.  Such a procedure is typical during the night, for example, when the operations duty officer is sleeping.     At the time of the  Morning Dew  accident, a newly qualified and inexperienced communications watchstander was on duty, alone, for 6 to 8 hours, and it was during this time that he failed to detect the word ""mayday"" in the 2:17 a.m. transmission and consequently  misidentified the call.     In addition, the Coast Guard is currently operating under an interim staffing policy, pending the results of an analysis of workload and staffing of all group and activity functions, that codifies practices in existence at the time of the  Morning Dew’s  sinking.  It permits communications watchstanders to work 12-hour shifts and sets a supervisory ratio of 1-to-5 for each watchstanding position.      In many communications centers, including Group Charleston, there is only one communications position; thus, the watchstander always stands a solo watch.  This leaves watchstanders with no backup if they need to use the restroom; are unable to sustain attention or wakefulness; or benefit from a ""second opinion"" in the case of an unclear call, a unique situation, or concurrent SAR cases.     While the 12-hour watch duration may facilitate scheduling, the Board does not feel it adequately considers the watchstander’s ability to perform.  Work schedules must not only ensure that duty positions are covered at all times, they must ensure that continuous vigilance by watchstanders is possible and feasible.  They must also take into account the need for oversight and supervision of novice watchstanders, so that sleep loss and fatigue do not degrade performance.  Sleep loss has immense potential to exacerbate the problems of excessive shift length, monotony, and boredom. Coast Guard telecommunications specialists endure long hours of tedium, make routine radio broadcasts, perform routine administrative tasks, and listen to a drone of routine radio chatter.  Without a mechanism for effectively monitoring their performance, a 12-hour watch can result in decreased alertness and diminished vigilance.       The Safety Board believes that the Coast Guard should develop permanent staffing policies that would require redundancy to monitor incoming radio traffic.  This would provide oversight and supervision of relatively inexperienced watchstanders, have a backup in evaluating incoming radio calls, and generally provide redundancy in the overall listening and decision-making process.  As a result, we adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to ensure that the workload and staffing analysis contracted with the Center for Naval Analysis fully incorporates existing human performance research on vigilance, attention, and fatigue in the determination of shift length, shift rotation, and staffing levels at all Coast Guard SAR communications centers.     Communications Center Watchstander Training     The Board’s investigation of the  Morning Dew  also examined the training received by the communications center watchstander on duty at the time of the accident.  Since his entire experience as a communications watchstander at the time of the accident consisted of 6 months’ duty at Group Charleston, we were particularly interested in whether his training adequately prepared him for the position.       Regular Coast Guard communications watchstanders attend a 10-week telecommunications school, during which they learn the operation of various communications equipment, radiotelephone protocols, and procedures for handling different types of communications, including distress messages.  After completing the formal classroom training, they must complete the  Group and Stations Communications Watchstander Qualification Guide  and on-the-job training at their assigned communications center.  The guide contains five divisions of qualification tasks comprising reading assignments and a number of tasks in each of the 22 divisions to be completed and practiced in sequence by the student, with the help of the instructor.  Once candidate watchstanders complete the local on-the-job training, they are required to pass an oral examination by a qualifications review board before they are considered qualified to stand watch unsupervised.     The communications watchstander on duty at the time of the accident had completed on-the-job training on the qualification guide in 3 to 4 weeks, and spent only 20 to 30 minutes before his oral qualification review board.  In order to complete his guide in 4 weeks, the candidate watchstander had to complete and master more than 4 to 6 tasks weekly, including completing the associated reading assignments.       The Safety Board believes that novice watchstanders should be provided with ample opportunity to practice what they were taught during their formal schooling and on-the-job training, and to demonstrate a suitable level of proficiency before they are deemed qualified to stand watch.       In addition, the current focus of the training for communications watchstanders is on the proper operation of hardware and the use of standardized responses to typical situations.  However, communications watchstanders do not handle only typical situations.  They also encounter atypical situations that require them to use analytical skills to make judgments and formulate decisions that may have life-and-death implications.  For example, the watchstander in the  Morning Dew  accident failed to take into account such factors as the urgency in the voice of the caller, the time of night, and the prevailing weather when he concluded that the 2:17 a.m. call from the vessel did not require action.  Similarly, in regard to the report of cries from the water, the operations duty officer at Group Charleston did not take into account the nature of the report, the credibility of those making the report, or the potential effectiveness of the pilot boat when he allowed that vessel to conduct an independent search even though Coast Guard resources were available.     The Safety Board adopted a safety recommendation to the Coast Guard that calls for implementation of a course or training program for all operations and communications center watchstanders designed to develop or enhance those individuals’ judgment and decision-making skills.     Investigation Coordination     Because of questions raised in the months after the  Morning Dew  accident regarding investigation coordination, this issue was of interest to the Board.  Throughout the initial response to the accident, the SCNDR, the coroner, and local agencies participated in an Incident Command System (ICS) that allowed them to effectively manage their personnel, resources, and communications.       The ICS allows different agencies with d operating procedures to work together in one system to accomplish a common goal.  The ICS also reduces the duplication of effort and the burden that can be placed on people involved in an accident investigation who must obtain similar information from different parties.  The fact that the Coast Guard did not participate in this system resulted in a lack of coordination between the Coast Guard and local agencies.  For example:        Both the coroner and the Coast Guard needed information from the families of the deceased.  The Coast Guard needed to know how many people had been on the vessel, and the coroner needed to establish their identities and made death notifications.  Had the Coast Guard participated in the ICS, Coast Guard representatives would have been aware of the coroner’s procedures, and the process would have been much better coordinated.         The SCDNR investigator-in-charge arrived on scene and was told that the Coast Guard had already requested that a commercial salvage operator send divers to identify the name on the sailboat.  The SCDNR investigator-in-charge, wanting to preserve any evidence in case of a criminal investigation, had to tell the divers not to disturb any of the evidence.  The preservation of evidence should have been discussed before divers were deployed.         Although a Coast Guard representative was in telephonic contact with an SCDNR representative and police officials during different phases of the response, the absence of a Coast Guard representative at the command post where decisions were being made resulted in the Coast Guard representative’s not being able to efficiently track the progress being made in the joint investigation or to answer any questions.  In addition, he was not able to provide information known to the Coast Guard that may have facilitated the SCDNR investigation.  For example, the investigator-in-charge learned from the newspaper about a witness who saw the  Morning Dew  and about the reports to the Coast Guard of a boatswain hearing cries from the water.       The problems in coordination that arose during this accident could have been avoided if the Coast Guard, the SCNDR, and local responders had used a system that allowed them to manage a joint SAR operation.  Therefore, the Safety Board adopted a recommendation that asks the Coast Guard to implement a program whereby Coast Guard emergency response personnel participate in drills with local agencies within their area of responsibility in order to exercise their role in the incident command structure, and gain experience in using the incident command system.      When reviewing the initial accident investigation coordination, the Board was distressed to learn that the commanding officer of Group Charleston was unaware of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Coast Guard and the State, even though it had been in place since 1984.  The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 specified that cooperative agreements between the Coast Guard and each of the states within the district’s area of responsibility be in place to foster cooperation between State and Federal governments in reducing deaths, injuries, and property damage from recreational boating accidents.  These agreements usually cover such subject areas as law enforcement, public education and training, boating casualty reporting and investigative reports, SAR, aids to navigation, and use of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.     Although the agreement between the Coast Guard and the State of South Carolina had been reviewed in 1994, personnel changes have occurred in both the state agencies and the Coast Guard, and telephone numbers and points of contact may also have changed.  Coast Guard Headquarters issued a message to all district commanders in February 1999 directing a review of all existing agreements or MOUs between the districts and other agencies within their areas of responsibility.  The guidance, however, did not provide a timeframe for the completion of the reviews, nor did it provide for follow-up periodic review and updating, which is necessary to ensure that the agreements are kept current.        The Board Members have asked staff to draft safety recommendations to the Coast Guard and the Governors of the 50 states to review and revise, within 6 months and at least biannually thereafter, all boating safety agreements between the Coast Guard and the States to ensure that those agreements are coordinated between local Coast Guard authorities and the appropriate agencies within the States and accurately reflect current responsibilities and jurisdictions of each entity in such areas as boating casualty accident investigation and reporting, SAR, and related boating safety issues.        The Safety Board believes that if the commanding officer of Group Charleston had knowledge of the agreement and its provisions, the coordination between the Coast Guard and the SCDNR in the aftermath of the accident may have been significantly improved.      Mr. Chairman, it is noteworthy that the  Morning Dew  investigation did not identify the actual search by Coast Guard boat and helicopter crews as an issue in this accident.  Once the SAR was initiated, it proceeded well.  But, in order for an SAR to take place, Coast Guard communications and operations personnel must receive, acknowledge, and act upon a distress situation.  In the case of the  Morning Dew , this did not occur until after the Coast Guard was notified by the Sullivans Island Police Department that bodies were discovered near the beach 11:15 a.m. on December 29, 1997, some eight  hours after the first mayday call from the vessel.        We recognize that over the last few years the Coast Guard has had its budget and personnel significantly reduced, and still maintained its high level of response to distress calls and lives saved.  However, we believe the Coast Guard should reexamine its priorities and make the necessary investment in infrastructure and personnel that will help ensure the safety of Americans on our waterways.  We believe rapid action in response to our safety recommendations by the Coast Guard will prevent the recurrence similar accidents.      Mr. Chairman that completes my statement and I will be happy to respond to whatever questions the Committee may have."
GX239-96-14995035	"CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY REVIEW FALL 1998 VOL. 3, NO. 1  Fast-Track Recalls U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Ann Brown, Chairman Mary Sheila Gall, Commissioner Thomas H. Moore, Commissioner  Recalling dangerous products from the marketplace is one of the most important responsibilities of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). And CPSC's efforts to improve this process -- with its fast-track consumer product recall program -- were recently recognized nationally. (See box below.) No company likes to recall one of its products. But when a safety problem makes a product recall necessary to prevent injuries and save lives, it is to everyone's benefit to move quickly. The CPSC fast-track product recall program speeds up the recall process and gets more dangerous products out of people's homes. This saves industry and government both time and money, and reduces the potential for injuries and deaths to the public. Since CPSC instituted a pilot fast-track program in August 1995, more than 315 recalls involving about 50 million potentially defective products have been conducted. About half of CPSC's recalls are now done under this streamlined system.  How Fast-Track Works The fast-track recall program is provided for companies willing and able to move quickly with a voluntary recall of their product. The fast-track program eliminates procedural steps from the traditional recall process. This includes CPSC staff's technical evaluation of a product to determine if a defect exists that could harm consumers. This procedure, called a preliminary determination, can take several months.

The specific recall actions to be taken, including notice of the recall to consumers, distributors, and retailers, must be part of the plan. The recall process must get underway within 20 days. If CPSC staff accepts the above information, the preliminary determination is waived, and the fast-track recall proceeds.  Many Companies, Many Products All kinds of products have been included in the fasttrack recalls. For example, a major manufacturer recently recalled tens of thousands of humidifiers that could potentially overheat or catch fire. A leading manufacturer of children's products recalled tens of thousands of baby monitors that could smoke and flame. A prominent clothing retailer recalled more than 100,000 children's jackets with zipper pulls containing unacceptable levels of lead. A well-known company recalled tens of thousands of gas grills because a defective hose could leak gas or cause fires. Other fast-track recalls have included such products as computer monitors, baseball batting aids, bicycle cranks, and play equipment. Recalls for all of these products were initiated in 20 or fewer days.  the percentage of products returned has climbed to nearly 60%. This is because it is easier to effectively recall a potentially hazardous product when the problem is identified early and action is taken quickly. Manufacturers and retailers can stop sales of products and return them before the products get into consumers' homes. In addition, recalls handled under the traditional recall process at CPSC also have speeded up since the fasttrack program was implemented. With the time saved using the fast-track process, CPSC staff can spend more resources on those cases that are better handled under the traditional recall program. (See Running the Recalls, page 3.)  What's a Recall? A product recall is a generic term for removing a product from the marketplace, as well as a repair, replacement, or refund of a product. The exact form a recall takes depends on the specific problem and the specific fix. For example, some products are potentially so dangerous that they need to be taken off the market and destroyed. Other products can be made safe by a simple repair. One important benchmark of a successful recall program -- whatever remedy it entails -- is that it reaches as many people as possible who own, use, sell, or distribute the product. To that end, CPSC and companies work closely together to alert consumers, retailers, and distributors to the product recall. This usually includes a joint press release with CPSC, a point-of-purchase poster, and other notices. Among these are paid advertisements, direct mail, video news releases, website postings, posters for display at medical offices, hospitals, child care centers, and repair centers, and incentives targeted to likely product owners.  Genesis of Fast-Track Since CPSC's inception in the early 1970s, consumer product companies have been required to report product defects that could create a substantial risk of injury to CPSC. Later, Congress also required firms to report unreasonable risks of serious injury or death. In recent years, CPSC has received 250 to 300 such reports each year. Companies who do not report product defects in a timely manner could be subject to civil penalties of up to $1.5 million. For many companies, reporting such problems carried with it negative connotations, as well as opened up possible product liability issues. Many companies did not readily come forward with recall programs. Other companies willing to do recalls felt that CPSC's required preliminary determination procedure actually slowed down the process. To speed up the recall process and to offer industry an opportunity to avoid the perceived stigma of CPSC's preliminary determination of a product hazard, CPSC staff suggested a pilot fast-track process in 1995. CPSC made the pilot program permanent in 1997.

Under the fast-track process, 2   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  Running the Recalls CPSC's Office of Compliance negotiates product recalls with industry. In an interview, Marc J. Schoem, Director of the Recalls and Compliance Division, talked about the process. What are the benefits of the fast-track product recall program? Our primary job is to reduce injuries and deaths from consumer products, and the fast-track program allows us to get dangerous products out of the marketplace and out of people's homes faster. These fast-track recalls take an average of just nine days from initial report of a problem to initiation of the recall activity. A traditional recall may take months. Why is the fast-track recall process faster than CPSC's traditional recall process? The fast-track recall program eliminates many technical steps. In a traditional recall, for example, it can take months to adequately evaluate a product to determine if there's a product defect and, if so, whether this presents a substantial risk of injury to consumers. This may lead to our preliminary determination -- or ""PD"", as we call it -- that a product has a problem. If so, companies are understandably concerned that the PD could be used against them in a product liability suit. The fast-track program eliminates the ""PD."" If companies come to us already willing to do a recall, then our staff doesn't have to spend valuable time determining whether the product has a defect. We can immediately begin working with the company to develop a recall plan to get the product out of the market. Why does CPSC still handle some recalls under the traditional process? Not all recalls lend themselves to the fast-track process. For example, we may believe a product has a problem, but the company doesn't agree with us. Another company may admit there's a problem, but hasn't identified a specific cause or can't figure out how to fix it. Some recalls are just too complex to do in 20 days. We then have to take the time to test and evaluate the product to make our case. In these instances, we'll handle the recall under our traditional process. How do you find out about products that may need to be recalled? Under the law, companies have to report product safety problems to us. If a company discovers that its product has a defect that could create a substantial hazard or presents an unreasonable risk of serious injury or death, the company must let us know immediately.  Do you find out about all dangerous products this way? Unfortunately, no. Not all companies report these problems to us, even though they're supposed to. We get a lot of information from other sources -- including trade complaints, state and local governments, fire and police departments, emergency medical personnel, and from consumers who use the products. In addition, we have great resources at CPSC, including our national hospital injury database, called NEISS, and our ability to receive complaints via our telephone hotline, web site, and e-mail. If, under the fast-track recall program, you rely on the company's evaluation of a product, how do you confirm that the information is accurate? We carefully review the information the company gives us. And, it's in a company's interest to give us complete information. If not, companies could put themselves in the position of having to do a recall twice. In addition, they might subject themselves to a substantial penalty under the law for not providing accurate information. So far, we have not had any problems of this kind. What has industr y had to say about the fast-track recall program? We've had a lot of positive feedback from industry. A fast-track recall means that companies can be ""in-andout"" in 20 business days. For them, that boils down to spending less time dealing with government and more time focusing on their business. The best indication of fast-track's success is that we've had ""repeat business"" by a number of companies under this program. Overall, it's a much less adversarial process than the traditional recall program. Is there any particular type of company that benefits most from using the fast-track recall program? We've found that fast-track works for just about any kind of company. We've used it successfully with small companies that have a limited number of products in the marketplace and with major manufacturers with millions of products that need to be recalled. Any negatives to the fast-track recall program? I think it puts more pressure on CPSC staff to meet these compressed deadlines. But I also think there's a greater sense of staff satisfaction in being able to get dangerous products out of the marketplace faster. After all, the fast-track program was suggested and implemented by CPSC staffers who wanted to improve the recall process.  3   Consumer Product Safety Review Spring 1998  Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  NEISS Data Highlights -- 1997 CPSC's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) collects current injury data associated with 15,000 categories of consumer products from hospital emergency departments across the country. Consisting of a national probability sample of hospitals of differing sizes and locations, NEISS provides national estimates of the number and severity of consumer product-related injuries. The 1997 NEISS estimates have been produced from an updated sample of 101 hospitals, including children's hospitals. Information from NEISS is available to the public through CPSC's National Injury Information Clearinghouse (phone: 301-504-0424).

Hosp. & DOA  * Estimated Number of Cases: Since NEISS is a probability sample, each injury case has a statistical weight. National estimates of product-related injury incidents are derived by summing the statistical weights for the appropriate injury cases. * CV (Coefficient of Variation): The CV, the standard error of the estimate divided by the estimate, is a measure of sampling variability (errors that occur by chance because observations are made only on a population sample).  * Number of Cases: This is the actual number of injury cases collected from the hospitals sampled. Since injury cases have different statistical weights, these ""raw"" numbers should not be used for comparative purposes. * Product-Related Injuries: These are national estimates of the number of persons treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments with consumer product-related injuries during the given time period. The data system allows for reporting of up to two products for each person's injury. Therefore, a person's injury may be counted in two product groups.  6   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  Consumer Product Incident Repor t Please contact us about any injur y or death involving consumer products.

Product: About 8.4 million Omega brand fire sprinklers manufactured since 1982 by Central Sprinkler Corp. and its subsidiary Central Sprinkler Co. The sprinklers are installed in homes, schools, hospitals, dormitories, nursing homes, and many other buildings. Most recalled sprinklers have 3 flat round metal disks stacked one above the other with a small space between each disk. Problem: CPSC alleges that the sprinklers are defective and could fail in a fire. CPSC alleges that, on average, between 30% to 40% of Omegas removed from various locations across the country for testing failed to activate as they should. The recall follows the resolution of the lawsuit filed by CPSC on March 3, 1998. CPSC has reports of Omega sprinklers not functioning in 17 fires with at least four persons suffering injuries and over $4.3 million in property damage. What to do: Call 1-800-896-5685 any time or access the Omega recall website at Omegarecall.com for information about identifying recalled sprinklers and getting free replacement glass bulb sprinklers and reimbursement toward cost of removal and replacement.

No injuries have been reported. What to do: Stop using the pajama sets and return them to a Limited Too store for a full refund. Call 1-800-934-4497 between 8:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. ET Monday through Friday for information. Product: About 200,000 AIWA mini home audio systems distributed by AIWA America, Inc. The recalled audio systems have model number CX-NA303U on the back of the unit. The systems are about 10 by 12 by 13 inches and include a combination radio, tape, CD player, and speakers. They were sold in electronics, department, and discount stores nationwide from March 1998 through July 1998 for about $200 to $250. Problem: These audio systems could contain a faulty transistor that can cause the unit to smoke, presenting a fire hazard. AIWA has 100 reports of smoking or emitting a burning odor and three reports of units catching fire. No injuries were reported. What to do: Stop using these mini-home audio systems and call AIWA America at 1-888-619-9353 between 6 a.m. and midnight ET seven days a week for instructions on returning the units for free repair. Product: About 58,000 wooden bunk beds made by Lexington Furniture Industries. The bunks are twin size and sold under the brand names, Lexington, Devan, YoungHinkle, Dixie, and Henry Link. The brand name is stenciled on the inside frame of the bed. These beds were sold in furniture stores and department stores nationwide from January 1980 through August 1997 for about $200 to $1,200. Problem: If the top bunk is mis-assembled, there could be a space between the end of the mattress and the end of the bed that could be large enough for a child's body to fall through, but small enough to entrap a child's head. Lexington Furniture has one report of a child falling through the space when the bunks were set up as twin beds; no injury was reported. What to do: Slide the mattress to either end of the top bunk and measure the space between the end of the mattress and end of the bed. It should not be 3-1/2"" or greater. If there is a space of 3-1/2"" or more, stop using the bed and call Lexington at 1-888-463-0111 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday through Friday for a free kit to close the gap.

What to do: Stop using the bassinet and call Century at 1800-583-4092 anytime for a free repair kit.   Consumer Product Safety Review Fall 1998  NHTSA Recalls The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is the government agency responsible for improving safety on the nation's highways. As part of its efforts to achieve this goal, NHTSA is authorized to order manufacturers to recall and repair vehicles or items of motor vehicle equipment (including air bags, tires, and child safety seats). The following safety recall campaigns are being conducted in cooperation with NHTSA. For more information about NHTSA recall activities, you can access NHTSA on the Internet at http://www.nhtsa. dot.gov or by calling the NHTSA Auto Safety Hotline at 1-888-DASH2-DOT (1-888-327-4236). American Honda Motor Company Honda is recalling 967,771 1995-1997 Accord sedans, coupes, and wagons (except the DX model and models with V6 engines) manufactured from April 1994 through May 1997. The factory installed air-conditioner wire harness was improperly routed allowing some wires to rub against each other, eventually causing a short circuit. The short circuit can possibly cause the underhood wiring to overheat and smoke, causing a fire in the engine compartment. A short circuit can also result in a blown fuse or dead battery. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Honda at 1800-999-1009. [NHTSA Recall 98V231] AmTran Corporation AmTran is recalling 2,293 1997-1999 Conventional school buses built with Code G47AODM outward opening service door and Code G47ACDC or G47A5DC manual door control and manufactured from February 1997 through August 1998. Certain clothing articles such as draw strings can become lodged between the door control rod clevis attachment as a person is exiting the bus. If the driver is unaware of this situation, the entrance door may be closed, capturing the item in the door, causing death or injury to the person exiting the bus. Owners who do not receive the free repair kit within a reasonable time should contact AmTran at 1-800-843-5615. [NHTSA Recall 98V200/AmTran Recall 98-303] BMW BMW is recalling 340,000 1992-1995 318i, 318iA, 318is, 318iSA, 318C, 318iCA, 325i, 325iA, 325is, 325isA,325ic, 325iCA, M3; 1989-1995 525i, 525iA, 525iTA, 535i, 535iA, 530i, 530iA, 530iTA, 540i, 540iA,M5; 1988-1995 735i, 735iA, 735iLA, 740iA, 740iLA, 750iLA; and 1991-1995 840CiA, 850i, 850iA, 850Ci, 850CiA, 850CSi manufactured from January 1988 through November 1994. A malfunction or failure of a coolant system component, such as a thermostat, water pump, or fan belt, can result in significantly increased coolant temperature and system pressure. If the indications of a critical overheating condition is not noticed by the driver, it is possible a coolant system component could be damaged or fail. If a crack were to form or a seam were to separate in the heater core end piece, hot coolant could suddenly be expelled inside the car, increasing the risk of personal injury to a car's occupant. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact BMW at 1-800-831-1117. [NHTSA Recall 98V178]  Chrysler Corporation Chrysler is recalling 685,000 1995-1998 Cirrus, Dodge Stratus and 12,996 1998 Plymouth Breeze and Chrysler Sebring passenger vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions and manufactured from July 1994 through January 1998. If the cable connecting the console shifter mechanism to the ignition key is improperly adjusted and the operator applies pressure to the release button on the console shifter to shift out of Park with the key in the locked position, the connecting pin in the shifter can break. If this happens, the ""ignition-park"" interlock system will be nonfunctional, and the vehicle can roll away if the parking brake is not set. Dealers will test and inspect for proper operation of the system. Any vehicles that are not functional after the inspection will have the shift mechanism and cable replaced with a ""self-adjusting"" design. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Chrysler at 1-800-992-1997. [NHTSA Recall 98V183/Chrysler Recall 789] Chrysler Corporation Chrysler is also recalling 157,000 1996-1997 Chrysler Town & Country, Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, and Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager mini vans equipped with integrated child seats and manufactured from January 1995 through July 1997. The shoulder harness restraint on the integrated child seat can become difficult to release when the safety belt latch plate becomes contaminated. This can cause difficulty in removing a child from the restraint. Dealers will clean the latch mechanism. An extender will be added to the emergency release anchor for the child seat safety belts so that the release clips are more visible and accessible to the operator in the event that the retractor mechanism cannot be unlocked. In addition, an instructional owner's manual supplement card will be provided. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Chrysler at 1-800-9921997. [NHTSA Recall 98V185/Chrysler Recall 791] Ford Motor Company Ford is recalling 175,000 1995-1998 Contour and Mercury Mystique vehicles manufactured from July 1994 through January 1998. The floor shift automatic transmission control can be damaged if subjected to certain interior cleaning products. The gear position indicator can deteriorate and not correctly indicate the actual gear position resulting in incorrect gear selection. Owners who do not receive the free remedy within a reasonable time should contact Ford at 1-800-3923673. [NHTSA Recall 98V233/Ford Recall 98S26] Volkswagen of America, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The  Commission  has received correspondence  from Carol Pollack-Nelson, Ph.D., requesting that the  Commission  issue  regulations that would establish a mandatory standard for hunting tree  stands to address the risk of falling, and ban waist belt restraints  used with the tree stands. The  Commission  is docketing this request as  a petition under the  Consumer   Product   Safety  Act. 15 U.S.C. Secs. 2056  and 2058. The petitioner states that incident reports and medical  literature show that serious injuries and death are associated with  hunting tree stands and waist belt restraints. She states that  ``regulation is needed to ensure that stands are designed with optimal  materials and instructions in order to reduce the likelihood of a  fall.'' She also states that, although waist belts are intended to  prevent injury, they have been involved in four fatalities where  hunters were asphyxiated by them.

Why it is important for everyone to wear a lifejacket while boating 5. Two factors that increase the possibility for hypothermia and frostbite 6. Two factors that increase the possibility for heat exhaustion 7. The causes, prevention, symptoms, and field treatments of hypothermia, heat exhaustion, and frostbite 8. How to create a hunting plan    Physical conditioning The creation of a hunting plan Knowledge of first aid 1. Anticipated weather 2. Altitude 3. Terrain Topography, or the changes in elevation, such as hills and valleys, is important for a hunter to consider when planning an exercise program. Walking up and down hills requires much more energy than walking on flat ground. Also, y ou w ill place added demands on your body if you carry a backpack. If you will be hunting at higher elevations you will need to remember that the air will have less oxygen. This, too, will reduce your strength and endurance.  Physical Conditioning Physical conditioning is the strengthening of your hear t, lungs, and muscles. Physical conditioning takes time to accomplish. Don't put it off until the last minute! You should develop an exercise program that takes into consideration your age, weight, and general health condition. You may want to consult with your doctor when designing your exercise program. Listed below are some general health concerns to consider: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Age Weight Heart condition Allergies Physical limitations Medications  S  TUDENT  P  ERFORMANCE  OBJECTIVES  OUTDOOR SAFETY KEY TERMS Physical conditioning Topography First Aid CPR Hypothermia Frostbite Heat Exhaustion PFD  Long before the hunting season arrives, a hunter should start preparing himself or herself mentally and physically. This will help to provide a safe and enjoyable hunting experience. Important things to consider include:  The type of hunting that you plan to do will also have an effect on your exercise program. You should consider the environmental conditions you will encounter when getting in shape for a hunting trip. Some of these include:  57   Creating a Hunting Plan Some hunters don't consider their hunt until they step into the field. These hunters are missing out on a very important part of the hunt, the hunt plan. There are many benefits in taking time to plan a hunting trip in advance. You will increase your chances of having an enjoyable and successful outing when you carefully plan each hunt. Planning in advance with your friends and hunting partners also builds excitement and increases everyone's knowledge. Most importantly, a hunting plan could save your life by helping you be prepared and by letting others know your location and time of return. A hunting plan should address many different things. For example, the area where you will be hunting and the type of weather you may encounter will determine what type of clothing you need to take with you. Remember that weather conditions may change quickly. A wise hunter will be prepared for these sudden changes. Obviously, a long and distant hunting trip will require much more planning than a one-day hunt close to home. For a single day's hunt, you may choose to take a snack with you.  For longer hunting trips, especially those that include setting up a campsite, you will need to plan much more carefully for food and shelter needs. This may not be a problem if you will be driving to your hunting area. If you will be backpacking, however, you will need to plan much more carefully. For these trips you will need to take into account the amount of weight you will be able to carry. Make a list of all the hunting equipment you will need so that you will not forget any important items. Carefully check all your equipment to be sure it is in good condition. Make sure that you are familiar with the use of all your equipment. Become familiar with the habits of the game you will be hunting, and be able to accurately identify the game. Study the hunting laws for the area where your hunt will occur. Know what licenses or permits are needed. You may also need to learn about the altitude and topography of the location where your hunt will take place. Write out a detailed schedule for your hunt and leave a copy with someone who will not be going with you. This becomes very important when emergencies develop or if you fail to call or return on time.  Things to Consider in a Hunting Plan:                Hunting licenses Proper clothing Expected weather conditions Food Water Shelter Necessary equipment Method of travel Educational preparation Hunting law familiarization Detailed schedule First-aid kit Survival kit Signaling devices Watch  Someone should know when you plan to return and your actual hunting location.  58   If you have done a good job of planning, it is likely that you will have a safe and enjoyable hunt. It then becomes important that you stick closely to your plan. There is much truth in the old saying, ""Plan your hunt and hunt your plan."" When you return home, you should review your plan to see what changes you should make for your next trip. This will help to make your next outing more enjoyable and successful than your last.  Hunters should also learn how to properly perform CPR. CPR (cardio-pulmonary r esuscitation) is a combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing. Severe injuries, such as a victim of a heart attack or a person whose injury causes breathing or heartbeat to stop, will need CPR. An injury can occur while hunting even when we are careful. It is important to know what to do, and what not to do, in such medical emergencies. Improper care could worsen the victim's condition. Anytime first aid or CPR is needed you should remember the three basic steps:  First Aid Everyone, especially hunters, should take a class in first aid. First aid is the immediate and temporary care of the victim of an accident or sudden illness until a professional medical person arrives. In order to give first aid, it is essential that you carry a first-aid kit. A good first-aid kit includes:  Latex gloves  Sterile gauze dressings  Roller bandages  Tape  Triangular bandages  Space blanket  Rescue barrier for CPR  Maintenance medications  First-aid book  CHECK  CALL&  CARE  CHECK the area to be sure it is safe to attend the victim. If it is safe, CHECK the victim to find out what happened and determine their condition. If possible, CALL for help. After help has been contacted, you should then CARE for the victim, using the knowledge you learned in a first-aid / CPR class. A first-aid kit that you have with you will help greatly in providing care for the victim. 59  Review your hunting plan carefully and often. You should add information as you have new ideas and eliminate things that are unnecessary or excessive. As the time for your hunt approaches, you will need to finalize your hunt plan.   Understand that mild bleeding and fractures are not usually life threatening. However, a person who is not breathing or has no pulse is at great risk of dying. A victim who is unconscious should also be considered at risk of dying.  Extreme Conditions Extreme weather conditions can also create dangerous health situations for hunters. Proper precautions can greatly reduce a hunter 's risk of injury or even death. Hypothermia is a condition where your body loses heat faster than it can produce heat. This may be the greatest threat to a hunter 's safety. If your body temperature drops too much in your vital organs, especially your brain and heart, they will stop functioning. Hunters may be at risk of hypothermia due to exposure to cold air or cold water. Wet clothing, wind, exhaustion, and cold water greatly increase the danger of developing hypothermia. It is important to remember that hypothermia can occur at any time of the year. Hypothermia has been called ""The killer of the unprepared."" Hypothermia is a common condition and the number one killer of outdoor recreationists. It is important to plan ahead before going into the field. 60  While hypothermia is a reduction of your overall body temperature, frostbite is the freezing of body tissue (skin). Frostbite most commonly affects your fingers, toes, ears, nose, and face. It is usually caused by direct exposure to cold or to high wind. Frostbite may lead to the loss of skin and tissue, and may cause blisters. The resulting damage may be permanent. To avoid frostbite, keep skin surfaces covered in cold weather and take the same precautions as given for hypothermia. Heat exhaustion is a condition when your body becomes overheated. Increased air temperature, poorly ventilated clothing, loss of body fluids, low physical fitness, or being overweight can cause heat exhaustion. If severe, death may occur from damage to vital organs. You can help prevent heat exhaustion by avoiding too much activity on hot days. Also, be sure to wear loose clothing and wear a hat when in the sun. Drink plenty of water even when you are not thirsty.  HYPOTHERMIA Prepare 1.

This is especially true when hunting in an unfamiliar location. In a populated area, this will not usually be a serious problem. However, becoming lost could become a survival situation in a wilderness region that is far removed from towns and homes. You should always plan ahead to be prepared when going hunting. The greater the chance of becoming lost, the more detailed your preparation should be. Preparation should start with a personal survival kit that should be carried every time you go hunting. A belt pouch or fanny pack can hold items needed in a survival situation. A good survival kit should include the following:                62 Pocket knife Compass Plastic whistle Matches in a waterproof container Second fire making method Fire starter Soap Water purification tablets Medication (If needed) First-aid kit Drinking container Nylon cord Extra glasses (if needed) Sunglasses Signal mirror  If you do become lost or injured while hunting, remember to  STOP. S = Sit T = Think O = Observe P = Plan First, SIT and rest for a while. Being rested will help you to THINK more clearly. OBSERVE your surroundings and PLAN your course of action. By following these steps, you will be more calm and prepared to evaluate your situation more realistically. Panic is the worst thing you can do when lost. By admitting that you are lost, you will know to follow the steps outlined below. You are less likely to make mistakes that will make your situation worse if you follow these steps. 1. Wait for help as long as possible. Wandering through the woods to try to find your way back to camp will most likely result in being further off course. Since a hunter should always tell his hunting partners where he will be going, they will be better able to find you if you stay where you are. 2. Before it gets dark, make preparations for an overnight camp. Start a campfire and build  M S      ETHOD OF  IGNALING FOR  H  ELP  3 blasts on a whistle 3 fires in a triangle Signaling mirror SOS in snow or sand  BELIEVE IT OR NOT. You CAN get lost in Ohio or become injured! Survival knowledge should be important to every hunter.   a shelter. Take a inventory of your supplies and plan on how you will make the best use of each item. Plan on making your supplies last for three days. 3. Remember that the international signal for help is three of anything. 4. Three loud blasts on a whistle will alert those within hearing distance of your need for help. The proper response when hearing this signal is two return whistle blasts. Anyone going into the field should always carry a whistle for such emergencies. 5. If for any reason you do not have a whistle, you may fire three shots from your gun. Use extreme care to be sure your shots will be in a safe direction. 6. At night, three fires located in a triangle will give notice of your emergency. In daylight, a small mirror may be used to reflect the sun's rays and attract attention. You may also spell out ""SOS"" in snow or sand. When you are hunting alone, or if all of your hunting party becomes lost, remember that you left a hunt plan with someone. When you don't return or call on time, they will start looking for you. This is why it is very important for you to closely follow your hunt plan. That way your  rescuers will know where to search for you.  Water Safety A to an sible also a boat can help a hunter get area that would be imposto get to by foot. A boat is n easy way to carry your gear.  Before getting into your boat, you should check the local laws for any required equipment that must be carried aboard your boat. One such item that the law requires is a PFD, or a personal flotation device sometimes called a life vest. Everyone in the boat must wear a PFD. If you should ever fall overboard, a PFD will keep you afloat until you reach safety. You should never stand up in a boat. Any quick motion or wave could cause you to fall out of the boat. Always remember to load equipment and passengers evenly in the boat and do not overload the boat. This could cause the boat to turn over or sink.  When hunting near water or from a boat this device can SAVE YOUR LIFE!
