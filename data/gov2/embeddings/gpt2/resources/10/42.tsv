GX026-54-15678861	"Attorney          General Files Lawsuit Against Illegal Pyramid Promoters in Tri-Cities         Pasco  -March 1, 2000- Washington Attorney General          Christine Gregoire today filed a lawsuit against 13 promoters of Renewal          Celebration, a large-scale illegal pyramid scheme operating out of the          Tri-Cities.          The lawsuit stems from a Renewal Celebration meeting          in Kennewick last September. Plain clothes police officers estimate as          many as 1,800 people attended and as much as $2.1 million was put in circulation          during the evening. The officers broke up the meeting and with court authorization          seized various records and about $50,000.          Pyramid schemes are an old consumer fraud and have          been reappearing recently in Washington State.          ""Pyramid schemes are illegal,"" Gregoire          said. ""People are enticed to join in with the promise they will get          more cash back than they contribute, but the reality is, the vast majority          of the people involved lose everything they invest.""          Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller endorsed the          filing of the lawsuit stating, ""Even after money and records were          seized from the committee, they simply moved their illegal scheme outside          Benton County. The Attorney Generals action is exactly the step needed          to attack this problem on a statewide basis.""          Gregoire praised the efforts of Benton County law          enforcement officials in investigating the Renewal Celebration. She said          the lawsuit is a cooperative effort between her office, the Benton County          Prosecutors Office, and the Kennewick and Richland police departments.                    Kennewick and Richland detectives conducted an extensive          investigation and attorneys from Gregoires office prepared the lawsuit,          which alleges violations of the Consumer Protection Act and Chain Distributor          Schemes Act.          Gregoire said the 13 defendants formed a committee          to promote illegal pyramid games under the guise of ""gifting""          programs. Since pyramid schemes are illegal, many operators today are          labeling them as gifting groups or clubs, often with family, church or          self-help themes. The defendants have previously used the names ""Northwest          Gifting,"" ""Friends and Family,"" ""Northwest Family,""          and ""Jubilee Celebration.""          ""These 13 individuals have cloaked their scheme          in feel-good words like gifting and renewal celebrations, but it is nothing          more than an age-old scam that separates a lot of people from their money,""          Gregoire said.          The lawsuit seeks to stop the defendants from operating          pyramid schemes, pay restitution to those who lost money, pay civil penalties          of up to $2,000 per violation and reimburse the state for legal fees.          The states lawsuit contends the defendants invited          people to attend the Renewal Celebration and participate in ""boards""          or ""reports."" In a typical board, eight individuals would be          recruited to join seven existing members in a 15-member board. The board          is registered by event organizers in a pyramid configuration, with the          eight new recruits at the bottom, four members above them, two more at          the next level, and a single person at the head of the board.            The eight new recruits would each pay $2,000 to the          person at the head of the board. The top person then moves off the board          with $16,000 cash. The board is then split in half, with the two people          who were on the second tier now moving to the top of the new pyramids.          The two new boards now must recruit eight new members, so it takes 16          people to pay off the top two people.                  Organizers also ran seven-member pyramids which required          an investment of $6,000 and pay $24,000.         Gregoire said people who get in first are usually the only ones who make          money because the deeper you go into a pyramid, the harder it is to find          new participants.          ""The 13 defendants we have sued today are perpetuating a fraud,""          Gregoire said. ""They have given it a new name, but its the same          old game, and despite the rosy promises, only a few people here will walk          away winners. The vast majority will lose everything.""          Members of the committee falsely claimed that the          payoffs were tax free because the IRS code permits gifts of up to $10,000          a year without tax liability. They also falsely implied the Attorney Generals          Office ruled the program was legal.          Gregoire said her office is beginning to hear stories          of pyramids collapsing around the state. There are stories of fist-fights          and people who could ill-afford losing money realizing they have lost          everything. ""Pyramids are especially insidious because in the end,          people are likely to victimize their friends and loved ones,"" she          said. ""They divide families and they splinter our communities.""                             -30-                       Index"

Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal pyramid. How do Pyramids Work? Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot. Why do Pyramids Fail? Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality, however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money. How is a Typical Pyramid Organized? A simple pyramid -- for example, a five level program built on recruitment by fours -- might work like this:  A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization. That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company -- $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter 's ""upline"" in the form of $10 payments to the recruiter 's recruiter, and so on through five levels. continued  Minnesota law prohibits all pyramid schemes because they deceive and cheat people. But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to get-rich-quick promises.  What is a Pyramid Scheme? Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually, there is no legitimate product being sold.

From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done by the four recruits and their recruits.  Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid? Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.    Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the people r e quir ed to support the pyramid.

Michigan has more land open to public hunting than any state in the eastern half of the U.S, and hunters in this state continue to be among the safest in North America.   During the 16-day firearm deer season, Nov. 15-30, nearly 760,000 hunters will spend tens of millions of hours afield hunting white-tailed deer. Last season, nearly one-third of the 19 hunting-related incidents resulted in tragedy. Two hunters died as the result of self-inflicted injuries, and four other deaths occurred because hunters violated the law and/or safe hunting practices.    Hunters can take simple, practical measures to avoid becoming a statistic:     Wear hunter orange--a hat, cap, vest, jacket or rain gear. This color is highly visible to other hunters but not to deer. Wearing hunter orange is not only a good idea--it's required by law.   Know where your hunting partners are at all times before shooting. A large percentage of hunting-related injuries involve members of the same hunting party.   Be sure of your target and beyond. If in doubt--don't shoot!   Handle firearms safely--handle every firearm as if it were loaded. Keep the muzzle of the gun pointed in a safe direction, your finger off the trigger and the safety on until ready to shoot.   Never load your firearm before you are ready. When traveling to and from your hunting blind, take down or have your actions open, and always carry your firearms unloaded in their cases.  Respect the rights of landowners. Request permission to hunt on private lands--it's the law!  Although no fatalities related to falls from elevated stands were reported during the 2000 firearm deer season, three fatal falls occurred during last year's archery deer season. Deer hunters electing to hunt from elevated platforms this fall should observe the following rules of safe tree stand hunting:     Practice setting up your stand and safety equipment at ground level first. Remember, only portable stands are allowed on public land and screw-in steps are prohibited on public land.   Make sure all equipment is in good working order.   Always use a safety belt and/or harness.   Always use a haul line when raising or lowering your firearm or crossbow; keeping the line away from trigger mechanisms and hauling stock first. Lower equipment into a safe position-- not directly in your line of descent.   Always unload your firearm or crossbow before pulling it up to, or lowering it from, an elevated platform.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

Throughout the 16-day season, one firearm fatality and 17 non-fatal injuries occurred. This follows the previous safest season on record, 2001, when one fatality and 14 non-fatal injuries occurred and 1996, when one fatality and 15 non-fatal injuries occurred.      The lone firearm-related fatality, as well as three non-fatal injuries, resulted from violations of law   and/or safety practices. The non-fatal firearms incidents included 12 self-inflicted injuries. One individual died as a result of a tree-stand fall.     Any fatality or serious injury related to hunting is tragic; however, most of these incidents are preventable. Michigan's overall safety record continues to be the best in the nation. Credit belongs to hunter education efforts, safety laws (especially hunter orange, now in its 25th year) and to those individuals who volunteer their time to instruct students or who work to enforce the natural resources laws. Michigan hunters, by observing the laws and safety guidelines, have helped contribute to a 50% reduction in hunting-related injuries over the past decade.

But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit         new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to         get-rich-quick promises.            What is a Pyramid Scheme?             Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and         small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who         recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value         (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the         promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join         the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually,         there is no legitimate product being sold.            How are Pyramids Disguised?             Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational         companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call         themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what         distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new         members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal         pyramid.            How do Pyramids Work?             Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of         promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them         to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from         there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain         the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number         of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the         ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial         ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune         because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.            Why do Pyramids Fail?             Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members         are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would         have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality,         however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has         less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.            How is a Typical Pyramid Organized?            A simple pyramid — for example, a five level program built on recruitment by         fours — might work like this:            • A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.            • That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company —         $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in         the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.            • The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more         people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.            • From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done         by the four recruits and their recruits.            Pyramid Reality             • Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature         deceptive, they have been made illegal by the Minnesota legislature. There is a real risk         that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to         fines and possible arrest.            • Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not,         are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them         were fully explained.            • Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many         losers pay a few winners.            Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?             Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a         frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play         upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind         of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.            Protect Yourself            • Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any         contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear         overnight.            • Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its         officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees;         buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.            • Get copies of all available company literature.            • Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find         out if the products are actually being sold to customers.            • Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Minnesota Attorney General's         Office, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the         Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid         scheme.            Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the         people required to support the pyramid.

But promoters continue to hype pyramid schemes and recruit         new people. con artists running the scams are looking for people who are vulnerable to         get-rich-quick promises.            What is a Pyramid Scheme?             Pyramid schemes are illegal money-making ventures for individuals, businesses, and         small groups of people. A typical pyramid scheme involves a few individuals at the top who         recruit participants who, in turn, recruit other participants to offer something of value         (usually money, but in some cases, time) to the organization. Recruits are offered the         promise of large sums of money if they successfully bring in others to pay money to join         the pyramid. Pyramid schemes focus on the exchange of money and recruitment. Usually,         there is no legitimate product being sold.            How are Pyramids Disguised?             Pyramid schemes may be disguised as games, chain letters, buying clubs, motivational         companies, mail order operations, or investment organizations. Some pyramid schemes call         themselves multi-level marketing operations. The sale of legitimate products is what         distinguishes multi-level operations from pyramids. When the emphasis is on recruiting new         members rather than selling something of value the organization is probably an illegal         pyramid.            How do Pyramids Work?             Basically, a pyramid scheme is formed when a single promoter (or small group of         promoters) collects money from a certain number of ""friends"" and instructs them         to collect more money from more of their ""friends."" The cycle goes on from         there. As the pyramid grows, the number of people involved becomes too large to sustain         the pyramid. Some people will fail to send in their money, or recruit the required number         of ""friends,"" and the pyramid crumbles. The majority of people end up on the         ""bottom"" of the pyramid and inevitably will lose their initial         ""investment."" They won't get their money back or earn their promised fortune         because no one is beneath them in the pyramid adding new money to the pot.            Why do Pyramids Fail?             Pyramid schemes collapse when a few people drop out or refuse to pay, and new members         are not recruited in their place. In order for a pyramid scheme to profit, there would         have to be a never-ending supply of potential (and willing) participants. In reality,         however, the supply of participants is limited, and each new level of participants has         less chance of recruiting others and a greater chance of losing money.            How is a Typical Pyramid Organized?            A simple pyramid — for example, a five level program built on recruitment by         fours — might work like this:            • A new recruit would pay $100 to ""join"" the organization.            • That money would then be disbursed at regular intervals by the company —         $25 to the recruiter, $25 to the company, and $50 to the recruiter's ""upline"" in         the form of $10 payments to the recruiter's recruiter, and so on through five levels.            • The new recruit would recover the $100 ""fee"" by recruiting four more         people, each of whom would pay the recruiter $25.            • From this point a participant is supposed to make money from all recruiting done         by the four recruits and their recruits.            Pyramid Reality             • Pyramids are illegal. Because pyramid sales plans are by their very nature         deceptive, they have been made illegal by the Minnesota legislature. There is a real risk         that a pyramid operation will be closed down by police and the participants subject to         fines and possible arrest.            • Pyramids are deceptive. Participants in a pyramid, whether they mean to or not,         are deceiving those they recruit. Few would pay to join if the odds stacked against them         were fully explained.            • Pyramids are losers. Pyramid Schemes are based on simple mathematics: many         losers pay a few winners.            Why Would Anyone Pay to Join a Pyramid?             Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. At recruiting meetings they create a         frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of easy money play         upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. It is difficult to resist this kind         of appeal unless you recognize that the scheme is rigged against you.            Protect Yourself            • Take your time. Don't be rushed into any business deal. Show your attorney any         contracts you receive from the company. A legitimate business opportunity won't disappear         overnight.            • Ask questions about the competency and experience of the company and its         officers; the products, including the potential market in your area; start-up fees;         buy-back provisions; and actual earnings of current distributors.            • Get copies of all available company literature.            • Check with others who have experience with the company and its products. Find         out if the products are actually being sold to customers.            • Investigate and verify all information. Contact the Minnesota Attorney General's         Office, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, your local Chamber of Commerce, or the         Better Business Bureau if you suspect a company may be engaged in an illegal pyramid         scheme.            Pyramids inevitably collapse because it is mathematically impossible to recruit the         people required to support the pyramid.

Lansing, December 31, 1997 – A  Holt  man thought he was dreaming, but it was no dream – he won the top prize in the Michigan Lottery's Keno game!     After matching 10 of the Keno numbers drawn Monday, Nov. 24 – 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78 and 79 &150; the lucky winner was thrilled to learn it was true: he won the game's top prize of  $250,000 .     ""I didn't believe it,"" he said.  ""I taped the drawing and played it over and over.  I had to pinch myself because I thought it might be a dream!""     The winner, who requested anonymity, picked his own Keno numbers.  The winning ticket was purchased at  7-Eleven 028E, 1997 Aurelius Road, in Holt.      A regular Michigan Lottery player for 25 years, the winner is a State of Michigan employee.  He is the director of a Scrabble® club which competes in tournament play.  The winner said he plans to use his Keno winnings to pay bills, upgrade his computer, make home repairs and invest for his retirement.     The Keno game is designed to appeal to players wanting better odds of winning a prize.  To play Keno, a player selects 10 numbers between 1 and 80.  The Lottery draws 22 numbers from the field of 1 to 80.  Players win prizes if they match six, seven, eight, nine or all ten of their numbers to the 22 drawn by the Lottery, or even if they match no numbers at all. A player matching 10 numbers wins $250,000; nine numbers wins $2,500; eight wins $250; seven wins $25; six wins $7; and matching zero numbers wins a free $1 instant game ticket.

A representative earns commissions from retail sales he or she makes, and also from retail sales made by other people he or she recruits. Examples of well-known multi-level marketing companies include Amway and Mary Kay Cosmetics.           Some companies call themselves multi-level marketing when they are really operating pyramid schemes that violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act. Even when a multi-level plan does not violate Michigan's Pyramid Promotion Act, the marketing of the plan may violate Michigan's Consumer Protection Act, if the acts, methods, or practices are unfair, unconscionable, or deceptive.           It is understandable that consumers often have difficulty telling the difference between an illegal pyramid scheme and a legitimate multi-level marketing opportunity. Governmental regulators and the industry continue to debate where the legal lines are drawn. Multi-level marketing is a lawful and legitimate business method that uses a network of independent representatives to sell consumer products. Commissions should only be paid on the sale of goods or services to nonparticipant end-user consumers.           Pyramid schemes claim to be in the business of selling products to consumers in order to look like a multi-level marketing company. However, little or no effort is made to actually market the product. Instead, money is made in typical pyramid fashion . . . from recruiting other people to  market the program . Sometimes, new ""distributors"" are persuaded to purchase inventory or overpriced products/services when they sign up.           Pyramid companies make virtually all their profits from signing up new recruits and often attempt to disguise entry fees as the price charged for mandatory purchases of training, computer services or product inventory.           Pyramid schemes are not only illegal; they are a waste of money and time. Because pyramid schemes rely on recruitment of new members to bring in money, the schemes often collapse when the pool of potential recruits dries up (market saturation). When the plan collapses, most people, except the few at the top of the pyramid, lose their money.           Market Saturation           Although pyramid promoters claim that the possibility to earn is endless, this possibility cannot materialize due to market saturation. For example, if a program begins with one person who recruits two persons, each one of whom recruits two more persons, and so on, in only 28 levels practically the entire population of the United States - every man, woman and child, - would be involved as illustrated below.                      Level                 Number of New Participants         Total Number of Participants          1   1   1        2   2   3        3   4   7        4   8   15        5   16   31        6   32   63        7   64   127        8   128   255        9   256   511        10   512   1,023        11   1,024   2,047        12   2,048   4,095        13   4,096   8,191        14   8,192   16,383        15   16,384   32,767        16   32,768   65,535        17   65,536   131,071        18   131,072   262,143        19   262,144   524,287        20   524,288   1,048,575        21   1,048,576   2,097,151        22   2,097,152   4,194,303        23   4,194,304   8,388,607        24   8,388,608   16,777,215        25   16,777,216   33,554,431        26   33,554,432   67,108,863        27   67,108,864   134,217,727        28   134,217,728   268,435,455                           When investigating a multi-level marketing opportunity, you should ask about market saturation and determine the saturation levels in your area of distribution. Legitimate companies do not have too many distributors in one area.           Warning Signs           Pyramid promoters are masters of group psychology. Recruitment meetings create a frenzied, enthusiastic atmosphere where group pressure and promises of a large sum of money play upon people's greed and fear of missing a good deal. Promoters also openly discourage thoughtful consideration and questioning of the scheme. Victims often find themselves tricked into participating. At recruitment meeting you might hear phrases like ""this is a ground floor opportunity which will change your life"", ""opportunities don't go away, they go to other people"", and ""if you act now and work hard for three to five years, you can retire and live off of the residual income."" Another warning sign is a confusing compensation plan.           Claims by a company that their plan has been ""approved"" by the Michigan Attorney General should be bright red flags and you should report such a claim immediately to our office. A company that misrepresents one fact will likely misrepresent others. While our office is able to tell you if we have taken any legal action, we will not comment on any specific investigation of multi-level marketing companies. Additionally, we do not provide any advance form of approval for any company and if you want legal advice on whether a multi-level marketing opportunity is actually an illegal pyramid, you need to seek private legal counsel.           Chain Letters           The simplest form of pyramid scheme is the chain letter that asks the recipient to pay $1.00 or more to each of five names on a list, copy the letter, and then send it out to new people with the recipient's name added to the list. Many chain letters claim to be legitimate because they offer a product. Upon close examination, the product is just be a pretense. Often the newsletter simply describes additional ""get rich quick"" schemes and may be the only item that new members ""purchase."" Alternatively, the newsletter may be offered for ""free"" to every new paying member. In either case, the scheme is just a pyramid if it pays distributors to recruit new members rather than sell a real product to the wider public. In recent years, pyramid schemes have become more sophisticated, and many have surfaced on the internet.           Use Common Sense and Consider These Tips           The pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing opportunity is not always easy to spot, but is just as much of a scam as the chain letter. Here are some tips to consider before participating in a multi-level marketing program:          •  Avoid any program that focuses more on recruitment of new people rather than the sale of a product or service to an end-user consumer. If the opportunity for income is primarily derived by recruiting more participants or salespersons rather than by selling a product, the plan probably is illegal. Several courts interpret greater pressure on members to sponsor new recruits than to market company merchandise as evidence of an illegal pyramid.           •  Be skeptical of plans that claim you will make money through continued growth of your ""downline"" -- the commissions on sales made by new distributors you recruit -- rather than through your own sales of products.           •  Be cautious about specific income or earnings claims. Many programs boast about the incredibly high earnings of a few top performers (""thousands per week"" or a ""six figure income""). The reality is that most of the people recruited into the organization are not making anywhere near those amounts and most actually lose money.           •  Beware when presented with ""testimonies"" from other distributors. These ""success"" stories rarely reflect reality.           •  Be cautious about participating in any program that asks distributors to purchase expensive inventory. There are horror stories of people with a basement or garage full of merchandise that no one will buy.           •  Make sure the product or service offered by the company is something you would buy without the income opportunity and the product or service is competitively priced. Illegal pyramid schemes often sell products at prices well above retail or sell products that are difficult to value, such as health and beauty aids, new inventions or ""miracle"" cures.           •  Never sign a contract or pay any money to participate in a multi-level marketing program, or any business opportunity, without taking your time and reading all of the paperwork. Talk the opportunity over with a spouse, knowledgeable friend, accountant or lawyer. If you feel that you are being subjected to high-pressure sales tactics or are not being given enough time to review the details, go elsewhere.           •  When questions are raised about pyramids, comparisons may be made to corporations where there is one person at the top who makes the most money. What they fail to state is that corporations do not seek to recruit an unlimited number of employees or pay employees based on recruiting new employees.           •  Beware when the products or services are simply vehicles for recruitment. The products may be gimmicks and/or overpriced, but even high quality products may serve as a cover for recruitment activities.               Your Responsibilities           If you decide to become a distributor, remember that you are legally responsible for the claims you make about the company, its product, and the business opportunities it offers. That applies even if you are simply repeating claims you read in a company brochure or advertising flyer. If you decide to solicit new distributors, be aware that you are responsible for any claims you make about a distributor's earnings potential. Be sure to represent the opportunity honestly and avoid making unrealistic promises. If those promises fall through, remember you could be held liable.           If you join a pyramid scheme disguised as a multi-level marketing program, your decision will affect not only you, but also everyone you bring into the program. Many people devote a substantial amount of time trying to market these worthless ventures. Ultimately, if a multi-level marketing opportunity sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
