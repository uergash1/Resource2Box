Posted 1 week ago  #                                   The Other Parker       Member                      One of the things I love about music is that, like language, it evolves. I think it's a bit simplistic to think one person or group is ""responsible"" for the ""invention"" of rap music. Different aspects of it have been influenced by the amalgamation of different cultures of the world.   Scottish flyting evolved into rap battles? Maybe. A little web searching suggests influences as varied as Arabic naqa'id, Lebanese zajal, the Norse poem  Lokasenna , and Japanese Haikai.   Rap beats themselves are more obviously derivative from the jazz/funk scene, which in turn derived from African slave spirituals and tribal dances before theat.   And breakdancing battles may have their roots in  Russian folk dances ! Or in the tribal cultures of Africa (like  these traditional Nigerian dances ).   The most interesting thing to me is that there's really nothing new under the sun. Similar things came about in cultures far removed from one another. These are just Things People Do, and while they do evolve over time they're never completely original. Our ancestors have been doing similar things all through history and all over the world.

In episode one, Michaels does his usual bit: snaps photos of the ladies, then watches them drink and fight. Though one of his delicate flowers takes a test-tube shot where no test-tube shot has ever gone before. …   (more…)          Caryn Ganz          Comments (28) Link to this   E-Mail     More  Rock Reality Show Recaps ,   ""Rock of Love""                   Sebastian Bach, Jermaine Jackson to Compete for Nashville Fame on “Gone Country 2″      8/7/08, 10:35 am EST        Next week marks a very special occasion for us at Rock Daily: the season premiere of CMT’s  Gone Country 2 . On the reality series,  John McCain fan  John Rich of Big & Rich invites a bunch of very non-country B-list celebrities to his Nashville mansion to try and convert them into marketable country stars. Last season ended with  Julio Iglesias Jr.’s stunning victory  over favorites Bobby Brown and  American Idol ’s Diana DeGarmo. Leading the charge for this season’s cast is Sebastian Bach, who crossed genres brilliantly on MTV’s  Celebrity Rap Superstar  and stands as the early favorite. Also ready to rock a cowboy hat are Chris Kirkpatrick of ‘NSYNC (and VH1’s  Man Band ), Jermaine Jackson and this season’s prerequisite  American Idol  reject, Mikalah Gordon. Rounding out the cast is actors Lorenzo Lamas (who you’ll recognize from those terrible action movies HBO airs at roughly 3:15 in the morning) and recently rehabbed Sean Young of  Blade Runner  and  Ace Ventura  “Finkle is Einhorn” fame. The season two premiere will air next Friday, August 15th, at 8 pm.

For their final test, the girls had to write an original song to be performed with L.A.’s coulda-been Dap-Tones, Breakestra. Byata came a little granola, telling a backpacker-friendly story about the path to her hip-hop greatness. Celebrity judge  Missy Elliott  asked fellow judge Mona Scott (an industry vet) if she could even remember the hook and eventually came up blank. The usually fierce Rece Steele didn’t disappoint, running around the stage and coming so hard that even challenger Byata was singing along — eventually taking the $100,000, the title of Miss Rap Supreme, a week of MySpace hits and, most importantly, the honor of being serenaded by Kool Keith!

A Supreme Hour In Three Sentences:  After shooting some targets at the Los Angeles Gun Club (Ms. Cherry — out on bond — had to sit this one out), the girls spit a 16-bar verse about bringing peace to the streets. Byata totally blanked (”uh huh. yeah. we gotta do it for the children”), Ms. Cherry stumbled on her words and Rece Steel stared at her feet. Chiba was the only femcee that brought it, so of course now was the perfect time for everyone to jump down her throat at her about using pre-writtens.   (more…)          Christopher R.

Serch made everyone show off their hidden talents — though Nicky2States’ pathetic hula-hooping and Chiba’s abortive double-dutching assured whatever talent they had remained hidden. Finally, with the help of Just Blaze, the teams had to make a clean hip-pop song for the radio — promptly judged, live on the air, at L.A. hip-hop station KDAY. Byata led her team to victory for a third time, but if anything was ultimately decided, it’s that a Just Blaze beat can make anyone sound dope.   (more…)          Christopher R.

So what happened? David Archuleta’s  right hand reached out even more than usual  (perhaps he was grasping for his  backstage-banned dad ?), David Cook brought the big notes (and some  Switchfoot  love) and the judges told Syesha Mercado she was beautiful but sucked (in almost as many words). Here’s what you may have missed, in five quick clips:   5. Archuleta tries to sass it up and dance to a  Chris Brown  song. We have never missed Danny Noriega more.

Rock Daily sorts through the nepotistic wreckage.   Children’s Story:  We finally arrive at our last live episode, which opens in rapid fire fashion with Crosby Loggins shrugging his way through the Raconteurs’ “Steady As She Goes,” Chloe Lattanzi getting all twitchy on “Should I Stay or Should I Go” and Jesse Blaze Snider shouting along with Good Charlotte’s “The Anthem.” It only went downhill from there, as there were conversations with the rejects, collaborations with parents and an endless barrage of flashback montages for things that happened a mere five weeks ago.    Baby Geniuses:  While Jesse Snider was performing “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” the only thing the audience could be thinking was, “This is fine, but I would prefer if Dee was here.” And then he showed up!

Literally. From Syesha Mercado’s teary make-up-running interview to Jason Castro’s dreads a’flyin’ rendition of “I Shot the Sheriff,” nearly everything about last night’s homage to the 500 songs that shaped rock (as deemed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) was in poor taste — special props to Paula Abdul for this gem: “I think your ‘Hungry Like the Wolf’ has left me with a big appetite.” For the night’s best moments, watch these quick clips:   5. Is Jason Castro trying to tell us something? Read his lips: “Don’t vote.” Or was that “Don’t toke”? Either way kids, this man is a walking lesson.

A Supreme Hour In Four Sentences:  Director John Singleton stops by for “Hip-Hop Hamlet” if only to help us all cringe at what a stupid exercise this is — “Whether ’tis nobler in the domepiece to suffer the ballin’ and fallin’ of some outrageous fortune.” Cherry brags that she’s in three upcoming films and then blows it. Once split into teams, the girls worked out a dance routine at the famous Lulu Washington Dance Theatre. Team Lady Twist lost since the heavyset Twist was out of breath, the scrappy Bree was a showboater, but everyone learned their hot new dance that evokes images of fun things like sweeping the floor.

Children’s Story:  After getting record scores last week, Crosby Loggins doled out some dull trash talk about getting an automatic bye to the finale next week. This frustrated both Jesse Snider and Lucy Walsh, despite the fact that both seemed pretty confident they were also in the clear. Lara Johnston and Chloe Lattanzi panicked, probably because they weren’t very good. In the performance portion of the show, each remaining hopeful got to sing two songs, save for the two who were eliminated. Lara Johnston was sent packing, and in what could be considered a minor upset, Lucy Walsh was also shown the door. There were no tears in either of their exits; they probably remembered that even though they lost, they’re still both rich and able to score record deals.    Baby Geniuses:  In a week where everybody stunk, the highlights were few and far between.

David Archuleta pulled the Kristy Lee Cook card and performed “America,” Ryan Seacrest creepily played with a kid in the audience’s hair before Syesha Mercado’s second song and something happened in Paula Abdul’s mind that cannot be explained by simple science. For those moments and more, check out these quick clips:   5. Due to a tear in the space-time contiuum, Paula Abdul actually did see Jason Castro perform twice (her analysis of his phantom second song was  dead on , folks!).

A Supreme Hour In Three Sentences:   Too $hort  will be the first to tell you (over and over again… over the course of twenty-five years) that he truly knows the inner workings of women. So the ladies had to respond to his sixteen bars, or as Lady Twist put it: “Now is the time to get vulgar and ignorant.” Then  Ghostface Killah  showed up and hung with the spazzin’-out ladies for no particular reason — but who are we to complain about a Ghostface cameo?

Children’s Story:  Dull non-controversy continued in the Cradle Lounge this week, as Jesse Blaze Snider said something vaguely opinionated and everybody flipped out. Nobody flipped out better than  Bobby Brown , however, who was irate that his son Landon earned such low scores for his performance of “My Prerogative” last week. As for the show, the viewers said goodbye to both Lil B. Sure and Landon Brown, which prompted Bobby Brown to announce “We’re all going on tour”; the prospect of a show that included sets from Landon & Bobby Brown and Lil & Al B. Sure gives Rock Daily night terrors.    Baby Geniuses:  Jesse Snider continues to rule this show; his version of  Johnny Cash ’s “Ring of Fire” was uniformly excellent despite some middling scores from the judges.

Ryan Seacrest made a buffoon of himself (seriously, is this getting worse each week or what?), Syesha Mercado prepared for her future Broadway career, Brooke White goofed and started her song again, and Sir Webber had a grand chuckle over boys singing songs written for girls — let’s forgive him, he’s British. For the night’s best moments, watch these quick clips:   5. Lloyd Webber never thought he’d see a man with dreadlocks sing “Memory”?

A Supreme Hour In Four Sentences:  Veteran Khia demanded respect last week, even going so far as rhyming respect me with respect me a dozen times and calling it her sixteen-bar challenge. Whatever respect she gained was lost a mere three minutes into this episode when the  Miss Rap Supreme  staff discovered her entire challenge verse was lifted from Respect Me (of course), a song from her 2006 album  Gangstress . So German reim-spitter Lionezz got a second chance and the nine remaining femcees entered the So Seductive Rap Challenge, rhyming about whats personally seductive and alluring to you (something co-host Yo-Yo did just fine without ever doing) in front of the ladies at the Moonshadow lesbian bar. We barely noticed the change in scenery since theres already so much gratuitous kissing on this show.   (more…)          Christopher R.
