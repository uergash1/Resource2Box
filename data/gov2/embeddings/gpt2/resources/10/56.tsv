One of the most important tasks of paralegals are to help the lawyers to prepare for hearings, trials, corporate meetings and closings. Paralegals perform the background investigation into the facts of the case and make sure that all the important information has been considered. In addition to this preparatory work, they perform a number of other important functions. For instance, they help in drafting contracts, separation agreements, instruments of trust and mortgages.  Areas Of Work Many organizations require the expertise of paralegals. Law firms, legal departments of large corporate houses and government offices employ the services of paralegals. Within these organizations, they work in different aspects of applied law, such as corporate law, personal injury, real estate, family law, employee benefits and even criminal law. Since law has increased in complexity, paralegals now also specialize in their services. Paralegals in corporations and the public sector usually work a standard 40-hour week.  Training There are a number of ways to become a paralegal. The most common is a paralegal program at a community college that matures into an associate's degree. The other common method is through a program of certification in paralegal studies. Bachelor's and master's degrees in paralegal studies are also available at a number of schools. Some employers also train paralegals. They hire college graduates with no legal experience and train them hands-on.  Nearly 1000 colleges and universities, proprietary schools and law schools offer formal paralegal training. Graduation from a program with ABA (American Bar Association) approval can enhance employment opportunities. Familiarity with technical knowledge and the working of computers are also essential in paralegal work. The Internet and computer software are regularly used to research legal literature and save databases. Therefore, a course in computer operations can be extremely useful and is virtually essential. Job Outlook Employment for paralegals is expected to grow much faster in the future. Employers are trying to cut costs by hiring paralegals to take care of a number of tasks that were earlier performed by lawyers. Experienced and formally trained paralegals have the best employment opportunities. Insurance companies, banks, real estate agencies and title insurance firms are now hiring paralegals. The demand for paralegals will increase with the expanding population's demand for legal services. Earning Prospects Earnings of paralegals and legal assistants vary. Salaries are based on experience, education, training, the type and size of the employing company and the geographic location. In general, paralegals working for large legal firms or in large cities and metropolitan areas usually earn more than those who work within smaller firms or in remote regions. In addition to the salary, many companies offer a system of bonus to paralegals. The average starting salary can be anything around $30,000. Even the lowest paid is close to $26,000, while the top make as much as $60,000 or more. After five years of experience, the average salary increases. The average paralegal salary for the top bracket can increase to as much as $80,000 in five years.  If you have an analytical mind, and like law, then a career as a paralegal can prove to be immensely satisfying.    About the Author     Tony Jacowski is a quality analyst for The MBA Journal.

Web.com's services included do-it-yourself and professional website design, web hosting,  e-commerce , web marketing, and e-mail. As of March 2007, there were approximately 166,000 paid hosting subscribers in 2007 [ 1 ] .   Along with various web products and services, Web.com provided small businesses, entrepreneurs and consumers with advice and tips for developing a strong online presence. [ 2 ]  It owned the brands Web.com, Interland,  Trellix , and Hostpro.   On September 30, 2007, Web.com merged with  Website Pros . [ 3 ]           Contents       1   History   2   Legal   3   Website Pros   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   History   The Company was founded as  MicronPC , a multi-billion PC manufacturer but later merged with Interland, which was another public company based in Atlanta, GA. The combined company changed its name to Interland and sold the PC business to focus on Internet hosting. Interland's primary business was providing web services, such as shared and dedicated hosting. Interland acquired numerous hosting companies between the years 2001 and 2006, including HostPro, Innerhost, Dialtone, Interland, Burlee,  Trellix , Communitech and WazooWeb. The company acquired Web.com in December 2005 for $4.8 million and changed its name from Interland to Web.com.  [ 4 ]  In August 2005, Interlands Board of Directors decided to bring in new management with the goal of turning around the company. It removed its former CEO,  Joel Kocher , and replaced him with  Jeff Stibel .  [ 5 ]  Over the next several months the company also brought in a new Chief Technology Officer, Vikas Rijsinghani (former founder and CTO of VerticalOne) and a new Chief Marketing Officer, Judy Hackett (former CMO of CareerBuilder).  [ 6 ]   Web.com held 21 registered patents and claimed to have the primary underlying technology for various aspects of web hosting, software as a service, customer-facing control panels, and website builders.  [ 7 ]  Some of these patents were licensed to Hostopia, a wholesale web hosting provider.  [ 8 ]  On  February 1 ,  2007 ,  Netcraft  named Web.com one of the most reliable hosting companies.  [ 9 ]   When the company was known as Interland, the stock had risen to meteoric levels and then suffered with the "" Dot-com bubble "" and was ranked among the 10 worst performances for a United States listed company.  [ 10 ]  But since the company brought on new management and changed its name to Web.com, the stock price recovered. At the time of the merger with Website Pros, the company's stock closed at $7.15, which represented more than a threefold increase since new management joined in August of 2005. [ 11 ]  According to the companys financials, the last four quarters showed revenue and subscriber growth at Web.com, despite having consistently lost revenues and subscribers prior to the turnaround.  [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ]  During the first quarter of 2007, the company announced a profit and earnings growth but the second quarter of 2007 the company reported a loss, mainly due to merger related costs [ 15 ] .     [ edit ]   Legal   The company had been involved with various lawsuits, some of these predate the web.com acquisition:     Novell brought an action against Interland in 1999 claiming underpayment of royalties. It made an out-of-court  settlement  in 2005. [ 16 ]   The company made a claim against an insurer in 2000. The amount was settled, and Web.com received $6 million dollars. [ 17 ]   In June 2006, Web.com filed a law suit against  GoDaddy , which alleges that GoDaddy's hosting and domain plans infringed on Web.com's patents. [ 18 ] [ 19 ]   WebSource Media was acquired by the company on  May 24 ,  2006 [ 20 ]  but by  June 23 , Web.com filed to rescind the acquisition when it learned that WebSource had engaged in ""unfair and deceptive acts and business practices"". Web.com was appointed to manage the business operations as an agent of the receiver when the court ordered that it be managed by a receiver. [ 21 ]       [ edit ]   Website Pros   On June 26, 2007, Website Pros and Web.com announced that ""the two companies have signed a definitive merger agreement"". Website Pros, as the bigger of the two companies, acquired Web.com for a total of approximately ~$130 million, consisting of $25 million in cash and the rest in stock. Web.com representatives, including Jeff Stibel as the new  President , will hold two of seven seats on Website Pro's Board. [ 3 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ]  The merger was completed on October1st, 2007. [ 24 ]  Prior to the Web.com merger, Website Pros had acquired: 1ShoppingCart.com,  LEADS.com , NetObjects,  Renovation Experts.com , and Submitawebsite.

But theyre tough to write, so people either tell themselves that not sending one doesnt matter, or they procrastinate until its too late and almost pointless anyway.  But anyone who tells themselves that foregoing a fundamental rule of etiquette doesnt matter, not only taints themselves in the mind of the interviewer, but misses two additional opportunities to sell.    A thank you letter is an additional sales piece.  As Ive said before, youre selling a product and the product is you.  So beyond the reason of etiquette, the letter sells you as a polite person who recognizes that the interviewer gave them something valuable:  time and consideration.     A fundamental rule of sales is to keep the product in front of the buyer and reinforce its benefits.  So beyond the etiquette, the letter gives you ample space to comment on what you liked about the company, why your skills are of benefit to them, and how much youre interested.   If something wasnt tied up, or was left unsatisfactorily, you should use the space to further address the issue.   When you miss the opportunity to reinforce your skills and tie them to the job requirements, you miss a chance to sell.  When you fail to address a concern or answer a question and leave it to fester in the mind of the interviewer, youve failed to overcome an objection.  And if a buyer has an objection to the product, if it isnt addressed, the likelihood of the sale is slim.   The third opportunity missed by skipping the thank you letter is the chance to keep your name in front of the buyer.  Read newspapers?  Watch TV?  See the same ads over and over and over again?  Its somewhat the same principle  if you keep your name in front of the hiring authority, theyre more likely to remember you.     Thank you letters are one of the reasons its important to take notes during an interview.  Not only does it show good attention to detail, it saves you from having to scrunch your face up trying to remember some of the information you learned about the company and position during the interview.  Because if you met with three separate people during one visit to the company, thats three thank you letters&.three different thank you letters.   So lets look at how to create one of these so that it becomes a less odious task.    "" First paragraph  Open with the obligatory thank you and include how you enjoyed the meeting.  Say why.  Maybe the people you met were exceptional.  Perhaps their company philosophy was exactly what you had hoped for.  Or they need to overhaul a department and you cant wait to sink your teeth into it because thats what youve got a stellar track record of doing.  It doesnt matter.  Pick something out, and put it down.  But make it real.     "" Second paragraph  What took place during your interview?  Pull out a piece of information that pleased you, say what it was, and tell them why.  For instance:  I was particularly pleased to find that X company/the opportunity/your management style has/was/is/does whatever.  This is exciting because&& .  You can expand on whatever it is for a few sentences by elaborating:  how it relates to something youve experienced and liked -- or didnt like.  Discuss a particular aspect of the job you find appealing and reiterate why youd be successful at it or how long youve been performing it or how similar it is to something youve done in the past.       "" Third paragraph  You can add a similar paragraph if the second was fairly short.  Or you can wind it up if it was a bit lengthy.  If there was something that came up that needed clarification or about which they were dubious, address it and clear it up here.   "" Fourth paragraph  Wind it up. Re-iterate your interest.  Be enthusiastic!  Leave the job speak behind.  If you really want to be hired, let your interest shine through.  Theres nothing wrong with coming right out and saying, Id love  to work with X company!       Caution:  Dont start every sentence with I.  It may be the easiest way to write the letter but its not only repetitive, its a turn off and egotistical.   This process is about you getting a job, but its about what they get out of it if they hire you.   If you really want the job, the letter will be easy to write because it will contain genuine impressions and sentiments.   If you choose to skip the letter, perhaps you dont care if youre hired or not. But make that decision yours and withdraw from the process instead of letting the decision be made for you.

As a result, they disregard any additional information, such as certifications they have in their field, that would enhance their qualifications and assure that they stand out from the competition.                                     5:  English Spelling Rules: Adding Prefixes and Suffixes                    Knowing proper spelling is very important for a number of reasons. First of all, when words cannot be spoken from our mouths we can write them down. If these words are not spelled properly, then that communication is compromised.

It is not necessary, in the  financial accounting  sense of the term, for control of assets to the benefit to be legally enforceable for a resource to be an asset, provided the entity can control its use by other means.   It is important to understand that in an accounting sense an asset is not the same as ownership. In accounting, ownership is described by the term ""equity,"" (see the related term  shareholders' equity ). Assets are equal to ""equity"" plus "" liabilities .""   The  accounting equation  relates assets,  liabilities , and  owner's equity :     Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity     The accounting equations are the mathematical structure of the  balance sheet .   Assets are usually listed on the  balance sheet . It has a  normal balance , or usual balance, of  debit  (i.e., asset account amounts appear on the left side of a  ledger ).   Similarly, in  economics  an asset is any form in which  wealth  can be held.   Probably the most accepted accounting definition of  asset  is the one used by the  International Accounting Standards Board   [ 6 ] . The following is a quotation from the IFRS Framework: ""An asset is a resource controlled by the enterprise as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the enterprise.""  [ 7 ]   Assets are formally controlled and managed within larger organizations via the use of asset tracking tools. These monitor the purchasing, upgrading, servicing, licensing, disposal etc., of both physical and non-physical assets. [ clarification needed ]  In a company's  balance sheet  certain divisions are required by  generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP), which vary from country to country.     [ edit ]   Current assets       Main article:  Current asset       Current assets are cash and other assets expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed either in a year or in the operating cycle. These assets are continually turned over in the course of a business during normal business activity. There are 5 major items included into current assets:     Cash and cash equivalents   it is the most  liquid asset , which includes  currency ,  deposit accounts , and  negotiable instruments  (e.g., money orders, cheque, bank drafts).   Short-term investments   include securities bought and held for sale in the near future to generate income on short-term price differences (trading securities).   Receivables   usually reported as net of allowance for uncollectable accounts.   Inventory   trading these assets is a normal business of a company. The inventory value reported on the  balance sheet  is usually the historical cost or fair market value, whichever is lower. This is known as the ""lower of cost or market"" rule.   Prepaid expenses   these are expenses paid in cash and recorded as assets before they are used or consumed (a common example is insurance). See also  adjusting entries .     The phrase  net current assets  (also called  working capital ) is often used and refers to the total of current assets less the total of current  liabilities .     [ edit ]   Long-term investments   Often referred to simply as ""investments"". Long-term investments are to be held for many years and are not intended to be disposed in the near future. This group usually consists of four types of investments:     Investments in securities, such as bonds, common stock, or long-term notes.   Investments in fixed assets not used in operations (e.g., land held for sale).   Investments in special funds (e.g., sinking funds or pension funds).   Investments in  subsidiaries  or affiliated companies.     Different forms of  insurance  may also be treated as long term investments.     [ edit ]   Fixed assets       Main article:  Fixed asset       Also referred to as PPE (property, plant, and equipment), these are purchased for continued and long-term use in earning  profit  in a business. This group includes  land ,  buildings ,  machinery ,  furniture ,  tools , and certain wasting resources e.g., timberland and  minerals . They are written off against  profits  over their anticipated life by charging  depreciation  expenses (with exception of land). Accumulated depreciation is shown in the face of the balance sheet or in the notes.   These are also called  capital assets  in  management accounting .     [ edit ]   Intangible assets       Main article:  Intangible asset       Intangible assets lack physical substance and usually are very hard to evaluate. They include  patents ,  copyrights ,  franchises ,  goodwill ,  trademarks ,  trade names , etc. These assets are (according to US GAAP) amortized to expense over 5 to 40 years with the exception of goodwill.   Websites  are treated differently in different countries and may fall under either tangible or intangible assets.     [ edit ]   Tangible assets   Tangible assets are those that have a physical substance, such as  cash ,  equipment  and  real estate .

A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) plan, is a retirement plan for certain employees of public schools, employees of certain tax-exempt organizations and certain ministers. Individual accounts in a 403(b) plan can be any of the following types: - An annuity contract, which is provided through an insurance company. - A custodial account, which is invested in mutual funds. - A retirement income account set up for church employees. Generally, retirement income accounts can invest in either annuities or mutual funds.

(Hi, Dad!)  Our conversations got me to thinking about retirement account limits for 2008.  My wife makes mandatory contributions to a pension plan, I have a 403b account, and we both have Roth IRAs.  We are both in our 30’s.  I do not receive any ‘matching’ contributions from my employer.  We have a modified AGI of less than 150K.  For more information about  403b contribution limits, refer to IRS Publication 571 .  For more information about  IRA contribution limits, refer to IRS Publication 590 .  (By the way, I know very, very little about taxes or retirement accounts.  Please, do your own research and consult a qualified financial professional before making any financial decisions, especially decisions about taxes and retirement accounts.  I’m simply writing a  post about what I’m doing and I am in NO WAY suggesting that you should do as I do.  Seriously, I don’t even trust myself with a credit card, so what do I know? :))  After doing a little research, the actual limit for 403b contributions for 2008 is a little difficult to figure out.  Most sources report the 2007 limit of $15,500 but then suggest that the limit, starting in 2008, will go up by $500 per year.   So, for 2008, my retirement account contribution goals will be (based on assumed contribution limits):       2008   Under 50   Over 50       403b   $15,500   Up To $20,500       Roth IRA   $5,000   Up To $6000       I included the “Over 50″ numbers for my Dad!  So, in 2008, my goal will be to put $25,500 into our retirement accounts.  By the way, if you are wondering if you should focus on your 403b (or 401K) or a Roth IRA,  may I suggest that you read this excellent article over at Consumerism Commentary ?  Flexo does a great job of addressing the 401K/Roth IRA question!   Side note:  I was very happy to learn that the contribution limits are based on how much the employee contributes.  If your company ‘matches’ a portion of your contribution, that ‘match’ does not count against your contribution limit!  Also, the 403b limit is based on the assumption that the limit will go up by $500, based on cost-of-living increase.  The limit for 2007 is $15,500,  and many sources indicate that the limit for 2008 will be $16,000 .   (Edit: It looks like the 403b contribution limit will remain unchanged for 2008. It will be $15,500)                        Filed under:  Retirement    Share:  add to tip'd   -   digg this   -   stumble it   -   save to del.icio.us                  14 Responses               Rxforfinance    June 21st, 2007 at 11:47 pm    1         I believe the minimum adjustment for 2008 (and consecutive years) will be $500, but it is based on some gage of inflation or cost of living.  The IRS will give figures later this year.                     Mia    June 23rd, 2007 at 5:47 pm    2         Just an FYI - some companies set their own contribution limits.  We have a 401k and our company only allows for a max 15% employee contribution.  Unfortunately, we can’t reach the 2007 IRS limit  (same as 403b) without contributing more than 20%.  It’s still a pretty good plan though (100% match up to 6% plus an additional 4% company contribution).   The Consumerism article you link to advises to fund your 401k or 403b up to your employer match and then to fully fund your IRA’s.  But the author loses me when he states to then fund the 401k (to the max, I assume - another 9% in my case) “if your company offers you low-cost options”.  Anyone know what he means by “low-cost options”?  Isn’t investing with pre-tax dollars about as low as you can get?                     NCN    June 23rd, 2007 at 6:12 pm    3         Mia… You are correct, your employer can limit the amount you can contribute… fortunately for me, my employer allows me to setup my salary in any way that I wish and places no such limits… As for low-cost options… several 401K plans and 403B plans charge large management fees, and should be avoided…  NCN                     Mia    June 24th, 2007 at 9:30 am    4         Ah, thanks NCN.  We aren’t charged any fees so I guess we’re in the clear on that.  We are working on fully funding both of our IRA’s this year, and I’m curious about our next retirement funding step - fully funding the 401k, etc.  I appreciate reading about the steps you’ve decided to take.

Are the Roth IRA limits simply doubled for a married couple? My best guess is that each person individually opens a Roth IRA and they each have a $4000 annual contribution limit, but I haven’t explicitly read this anywhere.

Non-profit employees may contribute both to a 403(b) and a 457 and the limits are the same, except that the tax code is structured such that you can contribute the maximum to both plans.  In other words, you can put 16k into the 403(b) as well as up to 16k into the 457.  Very few public sector employees are aware of this powerful option to defer taxes.                     Anonymous    July 10th, 2007 at 5:37 pm    11         In response to Mia, it is incredibly unlikely you are not getting charged any fees — you may not be getting charged account maintenance fees but more likely in the form of fund management fees. Some retirement plans have funds which charge over 1% for “fund management” which is pretty outrageous in today’s investment marketplace where index funds with fees lower than .25% are common. However, some plans make it hard for you to find out the management fees; you may have to ask your plan administrator for a prospectus.
