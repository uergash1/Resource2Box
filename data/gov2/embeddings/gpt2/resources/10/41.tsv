GX233-95-8328018	"CONDIT HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC NO. 2342  REMOVAL PLAN SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Parties to the Condit Hydroelectric Project Settlement Agreement (""Settlement Agreement"") reached agreement on a proposed removal plan for Condit Dam and demolition and removal of all Condit Hydroelectric Project (""Project"") facilities with the exception of the Project's powerhouse. The proposed removal plan described as the ""Selected Approach"" in the Condit Hydroelectric :Project Removal Summary Report (May 1998) submitted to the Commission in 1998 as supplemented by removal activities and cost modifications listed in the Cost Removal Worksheet, a copy of which is attached hereto, collectively are the ""Removal Plan."" This document, the ""Removal Plan Summary,"" describes the basic elements of the proposed Removal Plan and includes a schedule of the removal activities. The demolition and removal of Condit Dam and other Project facilities, except for the Project powerhouse, are estimated to take one (1) year. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, PacifiCorp's contribution to planning, engineering, design, mobilization, demobilization, construction and demolition costs for Project removal in accordance with the Removal Plan shall not exceed $13,650,000 (1999 dollars). In the event of any conflict between this Removal Plan Summary and the Settlement Agreement or the Removal Plan, the Settlement Agreement and the Removal Plan shall control.  Removal Plan Summary Page - 1   The method for Project removal agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement was not reviewed in the Commission's October 1996 Final Environmental Impact Statement. The Settlement Agreement contemplates that before the Commission takes final action on PacifiCorp's application for the Amended License that the Commission needs to prepare a supplement to the October 1996 Final Environmental Impact Statement, engage in consultation as appropriate under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and take other actions as appropriate. REMOVAL PLAN ELEMENTS Dam Removal. The removal of Condit Dam would be accomplished by excavating a drain tunnel through the concrete base of the dam to rapidly drain the reservoir and to allow the dam to be removed in quarried blocks of concrete using conventional construction techniques. The drain tunnel is to be 12 feet high by 18 feet wide and would be excavated using drilling and explosives at the base of the dam, at elevation 174. The tunnel size is capable of passing 10,000 cfs. Concrete excavated from the tunnel would be transported to a spoil area adjacent to the dam by trucks that are loaded by a rough-terrain crane. An access road would be constructed to the existing spillway apron deck. The last 15 feet of the tunnel would be drilled and blasted, allowing the reservoir and impounded sediments to be sluiced through the tunnel, lowering the reservoir to stream level in about 6 hours. Prior to this final tunnel blast, a barge mounted clamshell crane would be floated in front of the dam to excavate sediment and debris from the area in front of the projected tunnel hole-through. When the area has been sufficiently cleaned out, the crane and barge would be  Removal Plan Summary Page - 2   removed from the reservoir and the final tunnel blast would be detonated to drain the reservoir. Should the tunnel plug with woody reservoir debris, measures will be taken to clear the jam. To allow anadromous fish to pass the site during the dismantling of the dam, a series of protective fish pockets would be excavated in each of the walls of the tunnel to allow a place for fish to rest during their passage upstream. Concrete excavation of the dam would proceed in the dry and start at the East End of the dam. Using drilling and explosives, concrete blocks with dimensions of 10 feet high by 4 feet deep by 6 feet wide would be removed with a highline yarder-type system to trucks for transport to the spoil area. The block size was selected to minimize the cost of excavation and hoist capacity, which would require average lifts of about 33,600 lbs. Construction would proceed across the dam in a series of top slicing cuts at ten-foot vertical intervals. The (very top cut and the front and back faces of the dam in each cut would be drilled and blasted into blocks and loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. As the top slice cuts progress downward and the dam widens, the center section would be drilled and blasted into rubble much like a highway rock cut excavation. The concrete rubble would be loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. This procedure would significantly decrease the cost of concrete demolition. As the top slice cuts across the top of the dam progress downwards below elevation 225, the existing river channel gets narrow and steep. At this point a crane would be set up on the spillway slab to hoist concrete from this lower area. As the excavation reaches the level of the drain tunnel, the center portion of the area adjacent to the tunnel would be excavated down to bedrock leaving sections of intact concrete along the edge of the tunnel and along the front and back faces of the dam to hold the water out. When the center section is completely excavated to Removal Plan Summary Page - 3   bedrock, the edge sections are blasted into blocks and hoisted out of the river channel. This should put the river down to its original channel. Lastly, the area around the drain tunnel is excavated in a similar method. This work must be scheduled during low river flows in order to perform a good job of removing the concrete from the footprint of the dam in this lower section. An earlier proposal for Project removal called for a gate to be fitted to the dam drain tunnel to control releases. Based on subsequent studies of sediment removal and with the concurrence of involved parties, it was decided as reflected in the Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Summary Report that a more rapid removal of the sediments was preferred. Appurtenant Facilities Removal. In addition to removing the concrete gravity dam including its Obermeyer crest spillway gate and other spillway and intake gates, demolition of the Project facilities also would involve removal of the upstream cofferdams, wood stave pipeline, steel surge tank, and the wooden and steel penstocks. Upstream Cofferdams: Photographs and drawings show that the cofferdams used to divert and control water during the original construction of the dam were flooded when the reservoir was allowed to fill, and would require removal to return the site to preconstruction conditions. To remove these structures, it is envisioned that a road would be constructed from the top of the excavated concrete dam and would ramp down to area of the cofferdams. The cofferdams are expected to be at least partially exposed by the erosive flushing of the reservoir. Some blasting would probably be necessary to remove one of the cofferdams, since the photographs indicate that fill concrete was probably placed in one cofferdam in lieu of the puddled earthen materials shown on the original construction drawings. The concrete, stones and boulders, and timber members of the cofferdams would be excavated and trucked to the spoil area. The temporary Removal Plan Summary Page - 4   construction road would also allow access to the upstream area where logs and other debris have sunk to the bottom of the reservoir. Some of these logs would be removed, as necessary, to promote reservoir sediment erosion. Surge Tank: The steel surge tank and its concrete foundations would be removed to eliminate a future public safety hazard. To allow demolition of the concrete foundation of the tank, drilling and blasting techniques would be used. The foundation and tank materials would be loaded into trucks and transported to the spoil area for burial. Wood Stave Pipeline and Steel & Wood Penstocks: The existing 13.5 foot diameter, 5100 foot long wood stave pipeline and the 650 foot long steel and wood penstocks, would be removed along with their concrete foundations. All of these materials would be transported to the spoil area and buried. At the time of construction it may be economically feasible to re-cycle some of these materials, and transport them to an off site recycling firm. For example, the scrap steel from the penstock, surge tank, and steel bands and fittings of the wood stave pipeline could have value at the time of removal. Site Preparations. Because the dam is located in a steep area, room for construction-demolition adjacent to the dam is limited. It is proposed that a ten-acre area be purchased and used for a site setup and staging area, a borrow pit and a spoil area. Site setup facilities would include an office trailer, equipment parts vans, equipment fueling and maintenance station, an equipment parking area and an explosives magazine site. It is estimated that two to three thousand cubic yards of fill material may be required for the construction of access roads to various areas of the project. This material could be removed from this spoil area and later back filled as the construction site is reclaimed. Removal Plan Summary Page - 5   A significant volume of waste materials would be generated from the demolition of the dam and associated facilities. Estimated quantities of some of these materials are listed as follows:     Concrete - over 45,000 cubic yards (broken volume) Wood Pipe Staves - over 6,000 cubic yards stacked Steel - over 400 tons Woody Reservoir Debris - from drained reservoir area (unknown quantity) Certainly, some of this material could be hauled off and recycled dependant on the market economics of recycling at the time of construction. A fairly large area would be required to store, sort and transport this material for recycling. Access Road Construction. One of the first activities of the project would be construction of an access road to the spillway slab below the dam to permit excavation of the reservoir drain tunnel located at the base of the dam. Access roads into the drained reservoir area would be used during removal of the cofferdams immediately upstream. Other access roads would be required for the removal of the 5100-foot long wood stave flowline. REMOVAL PLAN SCHEDULE An aggressive schedule has been developed to complete the dam removal project within one year. The attached schedule, Figure 1, shows the sequence and timing of the major tasks. Certain criteria have been used to develop the schedule and includes the following:    Work that affects water quality and quantity should be performed after October 1st. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) The diversion dam used in the original construction of the dam should be removed prior to May 1st to allow fish passage. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) Excavation of the 12X18 ft. drain tunnel at the base of the dam and the removal of low level concrete in the old river channel must be performed during low river flows (July through November)  Removal Plan Summary Page - 6   The success of this schedule is dependent upon many factors that are difficult to predict such as actual river flows and weather conditions that would be encountered and the impact of buried wood debris in the reservoir. If significant wood debris is encountered, the speed of sediment erosion could be reduced and additional time may be required to handle the debris and to keep the drain tunnel through the dam open. REMOVAL PLAN CONSTRUCTION COSTS Although the structural removal work and the flushing of trapped sediments in the reservoir would consist primarily of demolition, rather than construction, the work has been referred to in the Settlement Agreement as ""construction"" because construction contractors would perform the work. The Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Summary Report (May 1998) prepared by an independent consultant identified removal elements and estimated construction costs of $10,420,000 (1998 dollars) for the ""Selected Approach,"" including allowances for overhead and contingencies (15%), legal, administration and engineering (10%), and minor building permits (3%). With the assistance of another independent consultant, parties to the Settlement Agreement reviewed and adjusted both removal elements and construction costs. Based on that review, the Removal Costs Worksheet identifies removal elements and construction costs of $13,650,000 (1999 dollars) for the Selected Approach,"" including allowances for overhead (15%), legal, administration, and engineering (10%), and minor building permits (3%). The ""Removal Cost Elements"" total set forth in the Removal Cost Worksheet is the basis of ""Construction Costs"" set forth in Section 4.1.1 of the Settlement Agreement.

Oil is chiefly produced from the Lower Cretaceous limestone, called the Sunniland Zone by drillers, that underlies the region at depths ranging from 11,000 to 12,000 ft. Along with the crude oil produced are large quantities of saltwater, called brine. The brines are several times saltier than seawater, and small amounts spilled on the surface can render a potable water supply useless for many years. Analyses of selected oil field brine are shown in  table 11 . Chloride concentrations range from 108,000 to 164,570 mg/L, compared with about 19,200 mg/L for seawater.      Total oil production for the 13 fields during 1943-83 was 77.3 million barrels (bbl) (3.2 billion gallons (Ggal)), and brine production was 193.2 million bbl (8.1 Ggal). The largest producer of oil and brine ( fig. 28 , site 4) yielded 35 million bbl of oil and 73 million bbl of brine during 1966-83. The next largest producer ( fig. 28 , site 1) yielded 18 million bbl of oil and 52 million bbl of brine during 1943-83. During 1943-66, the ratio of brine to oil was relatively stable, as production was mostly from the field shown as site 1 in  figure 28 . Subsequent oil production at site 4 resulted in significantly greater amounts of brine, and in 1971 oil production leveled off while brine production continued to increase exponentially ( fig. 29 ). Ultimately, oil production began to decline in 1977, and brine production continued to rise. The brine-to-oil ratio in 1983 was 6.4 to 1.0 compared with a 1 to 1 ratio in 1964.

Brine and oil production for southern Florida oil fields, 1943-83. [ larger version ]                                 Some of the produced brine was used to repressure the oil-producing zone during 1966-83 to enhance oil recovery. This process is termed ""water flooding"" or ""secondary recovery"" and generally involves injection of the brine back into an abandoned oil well. About 23.6 million bbl (991 million gallons; Mgal) of brine were reinjected into the producing zone for water flooding.      A summary of brine production, by oil field, is presented in  table 12 . During 1943-83, about 193.2 million bbl (8.1 Ggal) of brine were produced, of which 169.6 million bbl (7.1 Ggal) were injected into the Boulder Zone (Lower Floridan aquifer) and 23.6 million bbl (1.0 Ggal) were injected back into the oil-producing zone.      Figure 30  shows the hydrogeology and construction details of typical oil field brine disposal wells at two oil fields (sites 12 and 1). The injection well at site 12 was constructed since establishment of the UIC regulations and incorporates current design criteria. The injection well at site 1 is a converted oil-production well with a cement plug in the lower confining unit of the Floridan aquifer system. Both wells, however, inject brine through perforations into the Boulder Zone (Lower Floridan aquifer), The main difference between the injection wells is that the injection well at site 12 has two strings of casing that extend from land surface to the middle confining unit of the Floridan aquifer system, whereas the well at site 1 has only one string of casing to protect brackish ground water in the Upper Floridan aquifer. Also, the injection well at site 12 has associated with it a separate monitoring well (not shown in  fig. 30 ) used to provide an early warning for leaks and upward migration of saltwater.

Elwha Dam was completed in 1913 at river mile (RM) 4.9, and includes a 108-foot-high concrete gravity section, gated spillways on both abutments, and a powerhouse with four generating units rated at a combined capacity of 14.8 megawatts (MW). Glines Canyon Dam was completed in 1927 at RM 13.4 and includes a 210-foot-high concrete thin arch section, a gated spillway on the left abutment, a thrust block on the right abutment, and a powerhouse with a single generating unit rated at 13.3 MW. Elwha Dam impounds Lake Aldwell, which has a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of 8,100 acre-feet at elevation of 197.0 feet. Glines Canyon Dam impounds Lake Mills, which has a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of 40,500 acre-feet at elevation of 590.33 feet. Both dams are currently owned and operated by the James River Corporation.   The goal of restoring the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries requires removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. The plan to meet this goal includes the following objectives:  · Safely remove Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams.   · Accommodate river flows during dam removal, through diversion channels and notches.   · Facilitate sediment management through controlled releases and systematic construction schedules.   · Address environmental issues by planning work shutdowns during certain periods.   · Retain certain structures for historical preservation at Glines Canyon Dam, allowing public viewing of the site from structures on both abutments and retaining the historic powerhouse.   · Achieve reasonable costs by limiting structure removal at Glines Canyon Dam and by selecting construction methods that are economical but do not sacrifice safety.        A Dam Removal Task Group was established to prepare feasibility-level designs and cost estimates for dam removal. The design process for development of the dam removal plans consisted of the following steps:  · Review existing information, including previous studies performed by others for the  Draft Staff Report  (FERC 1993) and  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994).   · Develop reasonable dam removal alternatives by considering previous designs, existing site conditions, project objectives, and current construction practices.   · Identify and address issues that could impact construction, including streamflow diversion, sediment management, safety, and environmental concerns.   · Develop an efficient construction sequence to minimize potential flood impacts and accommodate periodic shutdowns for salmon runs and potential flood flows.   · Prepare feasibility-level cost estimates for removal of each dam based on the preferred dam removal alternatives and assumed demolition methods.   · Document design studies by preparing a technical memorandum and feasibility drawings.  The reservoir behind Elwha Dam would initially be lowered by about 50 feet with the construction of a diversion channel through the existing location of the left abutment spillway. This would permit removal of the concrete gravity section and excavation of a significant portion of the upstream fill materials. The remaining reservoir would be lowered an additional 40 feet by the incremental removal of the remaining rockfill within the original river channel. All structures would either be removed or buried at the Elwha damsite, and the diversion channel would be backfilled to provide natural-looking contours on the left abutment.   Using a combination of blasting and sawcutting, the concrete arch portion of Glines Canyon Dam would be removed in 7.5-foot layers from the existing dam crest at elevation of 590.33 feet to the final streambed level at an elevation of 400 feet. Streamflow diversion would be provided by the existing power penstock for reservoir levels above 530 feet, and by a series of 15-foot-deep excavated notches alternating between the left and right sides of the concrete arch at 7.5-foot intervals, between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet. The concrete thrust block, gravity wall, and embankment dike located on the right abutment of the dam would be retained for use as a public overlook. The gated spillway, penstock, gatehouse, and powerhouse structures on the left abutment would be retained for their historical significance and interpretive potential.   The total field cost of dam removal is currently estimated at $20.2 million, including an allowance of 20 percent for contingencies. Costs for engineering and construction management would add approximately 20 percent to the overall project cost. A construction period of about 2 years is anticipated, with a recommended notice-to-proceed date of November 1. The proposed construction schedules and detailed cost estimates are included in Appendices E and F, respectively.   Additional construction requirements associated with dam removal include hazardous waste collection and disposal, removal of transmission lines, and road improvements. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) has prepared a separate report on the proposed collection and disposal of hazardous waste at both dam sites, with an estimated cost to the project of $1.2 million. Removal of 14 miles of transmission lines and poles was estimated to cost $238,000 (plus contingencies) in 1990. Improvements necessary for the Olympic Hot Springs Road for rehabilitation following dam removal are discussed in this technical memorandum, and by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in a separate report on flood protection requirements. Detailed costs of all features are discussed in a separate cost summary report in Appendix E.     CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION          The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (Public Law 102-495, also called the Elwha Restoration Act), passed by Congress in 1992, requires the ""¼full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries."" Since 1911, the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams in northwestern Washington have blocked anadromous fish passage to more than 70 miles of the Elwha River and its tributaries, limiting anadromous salmon and steelhead trout production to the lower 4.9 miles of the river below Elwha Dam. The removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams was determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be the only alternative that would achieve the goal desired by Congress.   Extensive studies of potential dam removal alternatives have been performed by others; primarily Hosey & Associates Engineering Company (1989) for dam owner James River II, Inc. (now James River Corporation), and Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Inc. (1991) for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. For demonstration of the technical feasibility of removing both dams,  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994) includes the work of consultants Summit Technology with R. W. Beck and Associates (1993) and provides estimated costs for the project. As part of an interagency effort, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) conducted a feasibility-level study on dam removal, sediment management, and water treatment alternatives to achieve restoration of the Elwha River. A plan of study for this work was completed in July 1994, and a Dam Removal Task Group was established to prepare feasibility-level designs and cost estimates for dam removal.   This technical memorandum discusses various dam removal alternatives, including those studied previously, and presents a preferred dam removal plan which is considered to be economical, technically feasible, and fully compatible with project objectives. This technical memorandum was utilized as a source document by the National Park Service (NPS) for the ""programmatic""  Final Environmental Impact Statement I  (Final EIS, Vol. I),  Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration  (June 1995). This document will also serve as source material for the draft ""implementation"" Final EIS, Vol II (April 1996).   While specific methods have been developed for removal of both dams for purposes of preparing cost estimates, the Dam Removal Task Group believes there may be some merit in having contractors submit technical and cost proposals for dam removal during the contract procurement process. This concept, called ""negotiated procurement,"" may allow for more efficient methods and for cost savings, and is often used when alternative or innovative approaches to construction are desired. This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan for the lowest overall cost        CHAPTER II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES          The action proposed by the programmatic Final EIS is ""¼to fully restore the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries through the decommissioning of Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam and removal of all structures necessary, including all or part of both dams, powerhouses, reservoirs, and associated facilities to achieve this purpose."" (Interior and Commerce, 1994)   The plan of study (July 1994) identified the following objectives to achieve project restoration:  · Develop and evaluate alternative plans for removing Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams and for controlling river flows while the dams are being removed.   · Develop and evaluate alternative plans to restore the physical characteristics of the Elwha River channel and to remove and/or stabilize reservoir sediments.   · Determine the long-term equilibrium channel characteristics of the Elwha River in the area of the reservoirs and downstream to its mouth at the Strait of Juan de Fuca.   · Identify impacts to water quality and use. Develop and evaluate alternative plans for addressing water quality impacts and maintaining water supplies.   · Identify economic impacts associated with dam removal.  The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (P. L. 102-495) authorized acquisition of both projects at a cost of $29.5 million, subject to the appropriation of necessary funds. The purchase is to include both dams, appurtenant works, and project lands. Upon conveyance of the projects to the United States, the Secretary of the Interior will be responsible for maintaining the dams in a safe condition until their removal. Both dams are currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places and an ""Historic American Engineering Record"" must be prepared to fully document each project as mitigation for their removal. Retention of portions of the original structures to the extent possible could help mitigate the impacts of dam removal and facilitate project interpretation.              CHAPTER III. EXISTING PROJECT FEATURES          A. ELWHA DAM    1. General description  — Elwha Dam is located on the Elwha River, about 4.9 miles upstream from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, on Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula. The dam was originally constructed in 1911-13, and impounds a reservoir (Lake Aldwell) having a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of 8,100 acre-feet at an elevation of 197.0 feet. Since 1983, the reservoir level has been held within a 1-foot range of normal water surface, resulting in essentially a run-of-the-river operational mode, with flood flows required to be passed with little reduction. The primary benefit of the reservoir is power generation, although recreational benefits are also available. Maximum power generation occurs with 1,800 cubic feet per second (cfs) released equally through the four turbines, with any excess flow released from the gated spillways located on both abutments. Access to Elwha Dam is provided by an unpaved road off State Highway 112, just east of the Elwha River bridge.   Elwha Dam is currently classified by Reclamation (April 1995a) as ""high hazard,"" a category determined by the potential for loss of life in the event of a dam failure. An inundation map for failure of Elwha Dam was prepared by Harza Northwest, Inc. (1992). Peak flows of 159,000 cfs at the dam, reducing to 109,000 cfs at the lower Elwha River, resulted from the dam-break simulation. A safety-of-dams classification code of ""FAIR"" is appropriate for Elwha Dam, based on current NPS guidelines. The FAIR classification indicates that no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal operating conditions, that all essential elements can be expected to function under normal operating conditions, and that remotely occurring events of magnitudes approaching a probable maximum flood (PMF) or maximum credible earthquake (MCE) may cause a dam safety deficiency. Additional hydrologic and seismotectonic analyses, including the development of a new PMF and MCE using current methods, may be required in the event the dam is not removed.   Elwha Dam and its appurtenant structures were inspected for the NPS in September 1994, and an evaluation report was completed in April 1995. A copy of this report, complete with project drawings and photographs, is included in Appendix B. Detailed descriptions of each of the project features are provided below, and are based on previously published reports and available project drawings. All elevations used in this technical memorandum are based on mean sea level, and are 9.5 feet higher than the original project datum.   2. Gravity section  — The concrete gravity section has a structural height of 108 feet, a crest length of 112 feet at elevation of 199.5 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, a base width of 100 feet, and an estimated volume of 12,000 cubic yards (yd 3 ) above elevation of 90 feet. The upstream face is vertical and the downstream face is stepped, with an average slope of 0.85:1. A timber access bridge is above the dam crest and extends about 430 feet between the abutments, with chain-link fencing along both sides. Four low-level sluiceway outlets, each 5 feet wide by 10 feet high, extend through the gravity section at ""invert"" (lowest point of the interior) elevation of 121.5 feet, with iron slide gates provided on the upstream face.   Concrete plugs were constructed within 10 feet of the upstream end of these outlets in 1980 to permanently seal them. Currently, the downstream steps of the gravity section show signs of deterioration and spalling (the loss of surface concrete, usually caused by impact or abrasion), but the concrete mass is believed to be reasonably sound.   The concrete gravity section was originally founded on alluvial sands and gravels 80 feet thick.   A structural failure (blowout) of the foundation occurred during initial filling in October 1912, resulting in loss of the reservoir beneath the concrete structure (see Appendix A, Construction History). The subsequent placement of various materials (rockfill, fir mattresses [bundles of branches], hydraulic fill, and gunite (a type of reinforced concrete) upstream of the gravity section was effective in reducing the amount of seepage through the foundation. Investigations in 1968 revealed the existence of a large void beneath the gravity section (up to 15 feet deep), and measurements in 1972 showed a seepage flow of about 70 cfs. Compressive testing of concrete cores indicated compressive strengths in the 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per square inch (lbs/in 2 ) range. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the concrete gravity section in 1980 and 1986 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events.   3. North spillway  — A gated spillway is provided on the left abutment of the dam, containing four 13.75- by 19-foot Tainter (radial) gates with a maximum estimated release capacity of 18,700 cfs at elevation of 200.0 feet. The reinforced-concrete gate structure has an overflow crest at elevation of 179.2 feet, a total length of 82.3 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 205.0 feet), and an estimated concrete volume of 2,400 yd 3 . A concrete, ogee-shaped overflow section is provided below gate No. 3 for fish passage. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the north spillway piers in 1980 and 1987 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. The spillway chute was excavated in bedrock and extends over 250 feet from the spillway crest to the river channel, with a width of about 76 feet. Massive concrete gravity walls are provided along both sides of the excavated spillway chute, with an estimated volume of 2,000 yd 3 . The steel Tainter gates have a radius of 20 feet from the trunnion pins and a total weight of 52,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are provided in the concrete piers upstream of the gates. A single gate hoist is provided for local or remote operation of the gates, with an estimated weight of 5,000 pounds. A discharge curve for all four spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 1.   4. South spillway  — A second gated spillway is provided on the right abutment of the dam, containing five 13.75- by 19-foot Tainter gates with a maximum estimated release capacity of 23,300 cfs at elevation of 200.0 feet. The south spillway was constructed in 1914, after the initial filling and structural failure of the dam foundation. The reinforced-concrete gate structure has an overflow crest at elevation of 179.2 feet, a total length of 90.9 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 205.0 feet), and an estimated concrete volume of 1,600 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the south spillway piers in 1980 and 1986 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. The steel Tainter gates have a radius of 20 feet from the trunnion pins and a combined weight of 65,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are provided in the concrete piers upstream of the gates. A single gate hoist is provided for local operation of the gates, with an estimated weight of 5,000 pounds. A discharge curve for all five spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 2.

Intake structure  — A concrete intake structure is provided between the gravity section and the north spillway, with a crest length of 131.5 feet and four intake sills at elevation of 174.5 feet. The reinforced-concrete structure is founded on bedrock and has an estimated concrete volume of 3,400 yd 3 . The intake structure provides four upstream 12.7- by 13-foot slide gates and hydraulic hoists for the penstocks serving the downstream powerhouse, for a total weight of 40,000 pounds. Trashracks provided upstream of each penstock inlet have a combined weight of 70,000 pounds. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons (9 total) were installed in the intake structure piers in 1980 and 1987 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Concrete compressive strengths are low, ranging from 1,100 to 2,500 lbs/in 2 .   6. Penstocks and surge tank  — Four steel penstocks are provided between the intake structure and the powerhouse. Each penstock is about 190 feet long with an intake sill at elevation of 174.5 feet. The penstocks are supported on concrete saddles and within concrete thrust blocks having a total volume of about 600 yd 3 . The two penstocks to the north are each 9.5 feet in diameter and supply water to units 1 and 2. A 15-foot-diameter penstock to the south is supplied by two 9.5-foot-diameter penstocks at the upstream end, and branches at a surge tank to two smaller penstocks serving units 3 and 4. The surge tank is 120 feet high, with a tank diameter of 25 feet and a 20-foot-diameter riser pipe. A 30-inch-diameter penstock is provided for station service. Total release capacity of the power penstocks is 1,800 cfs while generating power. The steel penstocks have a total estimated weight of 572,000 pounds. The surge tank has an estimated weight of 275,000 pounds. A concrete walkway has an estimated volume of 50 yd 3 .   7. Powerhouse  — The powerhouse structure is located on the left abutment downstream from the intake structure, and includes two circa-1914 horizontal double-runner turbine generators (units 1 and 2, each rated at 3,000 kilovolt amperes [kVA] and 4,800 horsepower) and two circa-1922 vertical single-runner Francis-type turbine generators (units 3 and 4; each rated at 3,330 kVA and 5,000 horsepower) for production, a smaller horizontal turbine generator for station service (at 200 kVA), and governors and other auxiliaries for the units. The maximum rated capacity of the powerplant is 14.8 MW. Penstock releases are controlled by wicket gates at each turbine generator. The control room is located in the original powerhouse and contains the main control panel, communications, and protective relays. Manually-operated butterfly guard valves are provided for units 3 and 4, in addition to the slide gates at the intake structure. The second floor of the powerhouse contains a small machine shop and transformers and circuit breakers for the units.   The powerhouse structure is of reinforced concrete and has a main floor covering about 7,800 square feet (ft 2 ), with an estimated 6,900 yd 3  of concrete and 3,800 ft 2  of glass-pane windows. The mechanical equipment, including the turbines, governors, and overhead cranes, has an estimated weight of 515,000 pounds. The electrical equipment, including the generators, exciters, transformers, and circuit breakers, has an estimated weight of 950,000 pounds. Discharge curves for units 3 and 4 (vertical units) with various gate openings and with the turbine runners removed (for no-load operation) are provided in Figure 3.   8. Transformer yard  — A small transformer yard or substation is located on the right abutment downstream from the dam, above the access road. At the transformer yard, the generator voltage is transformed to 69 kV and conveyed about 6 miles via an overhead three-phase transmission line to the Daishowa-America paper mill (Line No. 1) or about 8 miles to the Bonneville Power Administration-City of Port Angeles substation (Line No. 2). A chain-link fence surrounds the electrical equipment at the site. The estimated weights for the electrical equipment within the transformer yard are included in the total weight provided above for the powerhouse.   9. Reservoir forebay  — Between 1913 and 1919, a massive stabilizing fill of large rock and hydraulically-placed fill (sand and gravel) was placed immediately upstream from the concrete gravity section within the forebay area. An estimated 200,000 yd 3  of earthen materials (including about 25 percent rockfill) must be removed to restore the original river channel. A reinforced-concrete (gunite) channel lining was constructed on the fill in the early 1920's within 200-300 feet of the dam, covering about 60,000 ft 2  of the forebay area between both abutments with an average thickness of 3 inches. The total estimated volume of the concrete channel lining is about 600 yd 3 . The channel fill includes an earthen dike extending upstream from a large concrete block at the penstock intake structure, to divide the forebay area into two distinct channels to the north and south spillways. The concrete block has a top surface at an elevation of 196 feet, and an estimated volume of 1,400 yd 3 .   Additional seepage control measures located within the forebay area include large fir mattresses having an estimated volume of over 2,000 yd 3 . A series of sheet-pile cutoffs were constructed to depths up to 50 feet below the streambed surface both upstream and downstream from the dam. A concrete-filled caisson was constructed near the toe of the dam below an elevation of 100 feet.   10. Fish screens and rearing pens  — An Eicher fish-screen facility is located on the left abutment above the penstock for Unit 1, and is owned by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). A small derrick boom crane was erected for installation and operation of the facility. Two large salmon rearing pens and a smaller tank-like structure were constructed on the reservoir near the right abutment. Access to the rearing pens on the reservoir is through the shop garage on the right abutment. These items are no longer used. At EPRI’s direction, James River Corporation offered the material to the City of Port Angeles. Port Angeles has identified specific items that it wants to salvage; the remainder becomes part of the project.   11. Log boom  — A log boom is on the reservoir and consists of logs cabled or chained together. The estimated length of the log boom is about 330 feet between abutments, and about 490 feet to the left end of the intake structure to isolate the left (north) spillway channel for controlled releases of floating logs to the river.   12. Maintenance shop and outbuildings  — A maintenance shop/office and garage is located on the right abutment of the dam, with smaller, wood-frame structures located on both abutments. The maintenance shop/office has asbestos siding and floor tile, with a floor area of about 2,150 ft 2 , including an attached garage with vehicle access doors on both ends. A garage on the left abutment has a floor area of about 630 ft 2 .      Figure 3. — Elwha Dam Powerplant Discharge Curve (Vertical Units)    new generation hard copy received 3/20/96   B. GLINES CANYON DAM    1. General description  — Glines Canyon Dam is located on the Elwha River within the Olympic National Park, about 13.4 miles upstream from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula. The dam was originally constructed in 1926-1927, and impounds a reservoir (Lake Mills) having a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of 40,500 acre feet at elevation of 590.33 feet. Since 1975, Glines Canyon Dam has been operated as a run-of-the-river facility, with flood flows generally required to be released with little reduction. The primary benefit of the reservoir is power generation, although recreational benefits are also available. Maximum power generation occurs with 1,150 cfs released through the single turbine, with any excess flow released from the gated spillway located on the left abutment. Remote operation of the turbine and of one spillway gate is possible from Elwha Dam. Access to Glines Canyon Dam is provided by the Olympic Hot Springs Road off U.S. Highway 101.   Glines Canyon Dam is currently classified by Reclamation (April 1995b) as ""high hazard,"" determined by the potential for loss of life in the event of a dam failure. An inundation map for failure of Glines Canyon Dam was prepared by Harza Northwest, Inc. in 1992. Peak flows of 650,000 cfs at the dam, reducing to 350,000 cfs at the lower Elwha River (including overtopping failure of Elwha Dam), resulted from the dam-break simulation. A safety of dams classification code of ""SATISFACTORY"" is appropriate for Glines Canyon Dam, based on current NPS guidelines. The SATISFACTORY classification indicates that no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized, and that all essential elements can be expected to function under all operating conditions, including such events as the PMF or MCE, which have only a remote chance of occurring. Additional hydrologic and seismotectonic analyses, including the development of a new PMF and MCE using current methods, may be required in the event the dam is not removed.   Glines Canyon Dam and its appurtenant structures were inspected for the NPS in September 1994, and an evaluation report was completed in April 1995. A copy of this report, complete with project drawings and photographs, is included in Appendix B. Detailed descriptions of each of the project features are provided below, and are based on previously published reports and available project drawings. All elevations used in this technical memorandum are based on mean sea level, and are 19.67 feet lower than the original project datum.   2. Arch dam  — The varied radius, concrete, thin-arch dam has a structural height of 210 feet, with a crest length of 150 feet at elevation of 590.33 feet, a crest width of 4 feet, a base width of 46 feet, and an estimated volume of 15,200 yd 3  above elevation of 400 feet. The upper 50 feet of the arch dam is reinforced near the abutments. The downstream face is vertical above elevation of 426 feet and the upstream face is curved. An abandoned low-level outlet works, or sluiceway, is located through the arch dam at centerline elevation of 450.33 feet. The outlet consists of a circular intake with a hinged, hemispherical trashrack, a 6-foot-long transition from an 11-foot-diameter to a 5-foot-diameter conduit, a 60-inch-diameter butterfly valve, and an 18-foot-long outlet transition from a 5-foot-diameter to a 6.5-foot-diameter conduit. A vertical ladder well on the downstream face of the arch dam and a horizontal adit provides access from the dam crest to the butterfly valve operator, which reportedly has not been operated since original construction. The trashrack, butterfly valve, and operator have a combined weight of about 12,200 pounds.   A concrete walkway and supporting piers were removed from the dam crest in 1969 to facilitate dam overtopping for passage of large floods up to the PMF. The dam crest serves as an overflow spillway with a discharge capacity of 86,000 cfs at the maximum water surface elevation of 611.8 feet. A concrete apron extends about 36 feet downstream from the dam between the canyon walls for erosion protection at the toe of the dam.   The downstream face of the arch dam was closely examined by Harza Northwest, Inc. in September 1991, and was found to be in very good condition, with no cracking, spalling, or significant seepage observed. Non-destructive strength testing of the downstream face resulted in relative concrete strengths ranging from 2,800 to 3,200 lbs/in 2 . The upper 18 feet of the upstream face of the arch dam was observed during the reservoir draw-down test in April 1994 and there were no visible signs of structural distress. An underwater inspection of the arch dam was performed in 1994 by Reclamation’s Pacific Northwest Regional Office using a remote-controlled camera, with no problems reported. Vertical and horizontal movements at measurement points on the arch dam, thrust block, gravity section, and penstock anchor have been satisfactory since monitoring began in 1966.   3. Thrust block and gravity section  — The right end of the arch dam contacts a concrete gravity thrust block, adjoining a low concrete gravity section and a reinforced concrete wall on the right abutment. The thrust block is 20 feet wide and 30 feet long at the crest elevation of 600.33 feet, and extends up to 40 feet above the bedrock foundation. The thrust block includes an abandoned 6 feet wide log flume along the far face, with an invert at elevation of 581.3 feet. The gravity section is 55 feet long and contains a 0.7:1 downstream face batter below an elevation of 593 feet, with an 18-inch-thick wall above this elevation. The reinforced concrete wall is 55 feet long and 3 feet thick. The gravity section and concrete wall contain a 6-foot-wide, 12-inch-thick reinforced concrete deck at elevation of 600.33 feet. The thrust block, gravity section, and concrete wall have a total estimated volume of 2,100 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, grouted, and ungrouted tendons were installed in the gravity section in 1969, 1973, and 1989 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Lampposts and handrails are located along the perimeter of the thrust block and reinforced concrete deck.   4. Embankment dikes  — An earthfill embankment is located beyond the concrete wall and gravity section on the upper right (north) abutment, and was modified in 1969 for containment of the PMF. The embankment has a crest length of 175 feet at elevation of 612.33 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, and 1:1 slopes. Riprap slope protection is provided on the upstream slope below elevation of 595 feet, with grass cover above elevation of 595 feet and on the downstream slope. The embankment contains a concrete core wall and has a maximum height of 80 feet above the bedrock foundation. The total estimated volume of the embankment is 5,500 yd 3 .   A second earthfill embankment was constructed on the upper left abutment beyond the gated spillway in 1973 for containment of the PMF. The embankment has a crest length of 260 feet at elevation of 612.33 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, and 1½:1 slopes protected by grass cover. The total estimated volume of the embankment is 2,400 yd 3 .   5. Gated spillway  — A gated spillway is located on the left abutment of the dam, with an overflow crest at elevation of 570.33 feet, and five 20- by 20-foot Tainter gates with a maximum release capacity of 63,000 cfs at reservoir elevation of 611.8 feet. Spillway releases pass through a reinforced concrete chute and flip structure to the river channel below.   The spillway structure has a total length of 120 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 600.3 feet) and an estimated concrete volume of 2,500 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, fully grouted tendons were installed in the spillway piers in 1989 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Each steel Tainter gate has a radius of 15 feet from the trunnion pin at elevation of 578.33 feet.   A single hoist motor is located on the hoist deck for gate operation. The combined weight of the Tainter gates and gate hoist is about 100,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are located in the upstream piers. A discharge curve for all spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 4.   6. Intake structure  — A 115-foot-high intake structure is located at the upstream end of the power penstock tunnel, about 200 feet from the left abutment shoreline. The lower intake chamber (at the tunnel portal) and the upper trashrack tower are reinforced concrete, with a combined volume of 450 yd 3 . The steel trashracks have an estimated weight of 50,000 pounds. The intake invert is at elevation of 501.4 feet. Access to the trashrack tower is by boat.   7. Power penstock tunnel  — The power penstock tunnel extends 568 feet between portals through the left abutment of the dam. The upstream portion is lined with concrete on the crown and sidewalls only, with a minimum diameter of 11 feet and a length of 167 feet. A 45-foot-long, concrete-lined transition is provided for the rectangular guard gate section at station 1+92, with a sill at elevation of 503.33 feet. The downstream portion of the power penstock tunnel is concrete-lined for about 172 feet (11-foot diameter), dropping about 27 feet in elevation, and then is unlined for the final 184 feet (13.5-foot diameter). The unlined portion contains a 10-foot-diameter riveted steel pressure pipe.   8. Gatehouse and shaft  — A reinforced-concrete gatehouse (floor elevation of 606.75 feet) is supported on concrete columns 17.5 feet above an 86-foot-deep, concrete-lined gate shaft extending to the power penstock tunnel invert. A 7- by 12-foot caterpillar guard gate is located within the 3- by 9-foot gate shaft for emergency closure and for penstock maintenance. Access to the power penstock tunnel is located downstream of the guard gate slot by a 2.5- by 2.5-foot access shaft. The gate and access shafts are covered by steel grating at the lower deck elevation of 589.2 feet. Access to the gatehouse is provided by a concrete footbridge. The gatehouse, support columns, and footbridge have a combined estimated concrete volume of 30 yd 3 . The portion of the gate shaft above the ground surface has an estimated concrete volume of 60 yd 3 . Gate operating equipment within the gatehouse is estimated to weigh 10,000 pounds.   9. Penstock and surge tank  — A 10-foot-diameter steel penstock extends about 75 feet from the downstream tunnel portal at station 5+70 to a steel transition and surge tank. The surge tank is about 150 feet high and is located at station 6+70 (centerline). The steel tank is 20 feet in diameter, with an 11-foot-diameter riser pipe and steel support structure on concrete footings. The penstock transitions to a 11.58-foot-diameter and drops about 73 feet between station 6+90 (downstream from the surge tank) and station 7+96 (at the powerhouse). A stairway is located on the sloping penstock for access to the surge tank, downstream tunnel portal, and transformer yard. Total weight of the steel penstock pipe between stations 5+70 and 7+96 is about 168,000 pounds. The surge tank has a total estimated weight of 130,000 pounds.   10. Powerhouse  — The powerhouse is located 700 feet downstream from the dam on the left abutment, and includes a vertical Francis-type turbine generator (centerline station 8+26, elevation of 403.33 feet) rated at 13,333 kVA and 17,500 horsepower for commercial use, a horizontal Pelton-type turbine generator rated at 50 kW for station service, and governors and other auxiliaries for the units. Penstock releases are controlled by wicket gates at the vertical turbine generator, with an 8.5-foot-diameter, hydraulically-operated butterfly valve provided just upstream. The unit has a maximum release capacity of 1,150 cfs while generating power. Discharge curves for various gate openings with the turbine runner removed (for greater capacity under no load conditions) are provided in Figure 5.   The powerhouse is reinforced concrete and measures approximately 40 by 60 feet, covering an area of about 2,400 ft 2 . The superstructure (above the main floor, elevation of 410.33 feet) has an estimated concrete volume of 500 yd 3  and about 1,200 ft 2  of glass-pane windows. The mechanical equipment, including the turbine, governors, and overhead crane, has an estimated weight of 400,000 pounds. The electrical equipment, including the generators, exciter, and transformers, has an estimated weight of 325,000 pounds. A concrete retaining wall located at the powerhouse within the tailrace area has a top width of 3 feet and is approximately 55 feet long, for an estimated volume of 140 yd 3 . A small metal shed near the powerhouse measures 12 by 20 feet and covers an area of 240 ft 2 . Access to the powerhouse is provided by an unpaved road from the left (west) abutment access road (Olympic Hot Springs Road).   11. Transformer yard  — A transformer yard, or substation, located on the left abutment above the powerhouse, is where the generator voltage is transformed to 69 kV and conveyed about 7 miles via an overhead three-phase transmission line (Line No. 3) to Elwha Dam. The yard contains electrical transformer equipment within a fenced area, including three single-phase transformers, a circuit breaker, and a disconnect switch. A metal shop building near the transformer yard measures 20 by 20 feet, covering an area of 400 ft 2 . Access to the transformer yard is by unpaved road from the left abutment access road, or by stairway and footpath from the powerhouse.   12. Log boom  — An extensive log boom system is located on the reservoir about 300 feet upstream from the dam, consisting of logs cabled or chained together and anchored on both abutments. Provisions have been made for boat passage, and for periodic release of accumulated debris through the log boom and over the dam crest.   13. Maintenance shop and outbuildings  — Two wood-frame residences, a boat house, and a maintenance shop are located on the left abutment of the dam. The two-story residences each measure 25 by 35 feet in plan view, covering a combined area of 1,750 ft 2 . The maintenance shop measures 27 by 50 feet, covering an area of 1,350 ft 2 . The maintenance shop is one of the original construction camp buildings, and has the original blacksmith shop intact. The boat house measures 15 by 25 feet, with an area of 375 ft 2 .

ENGINEERING GEOLOGY    A. ELWHA DAM    The foundation of Elwha Dam primarily consists of a variably-cemented, gravel conglomerate bedrock of the Twin Rivers Group, which directly underlies the structure. The exception is the main gravity section in the old river channel which is founded on Elwha River alluvium. Two vertical exploration holes (DH-A4 and DH-A5) were drilled in the left abutment forebay area in 1994 for core sampling and determination of bedrock depth. The conglomerate appears to be massively bedded, and moderately to slightly fractured. Three distinct joint sets were observed in the core, with generally rough and planar to irregular surfaces, which are lightly-stained-to-coated with iron oxide minerals. The first joint set dipped 5-15 degrees with a typical spacing of 2-10 feet. The second joint set dipped 20-35 degrees with a typical spacing of 1-2 feet, but as wide as 11-13 feet. The third joint set dipped 50-65 degrees with a typical spacing of 1-8 feet.   Excavations within the generally moderately to strongly cemented conglomerate are expected to produce stable, near-vertical cutslopes. Localized zones of more intense fracturing may be encountered near the blast hole locations from 1913, which may inhibit the effectiveness of blasting and result in local over-excavation. A top-of-bedrock contour map was developed for the damsite based on geologic mapping of bedrock outcrops, drill hole data, and available information from project drawings and records, and is included in  Geologic Design Data Report for Removal of Elwha Dam  (Reclamation, May 1996).   Following failure of the dam foundation and loss of the reservoir in October 1912, the forebay area immediately upstream from the dam was backfilled in stages between 1913 and 1919 to restore the reservoir and reduce seepage losses through the foundation. Heavy blasting of both canyon walls was performed in 1913 to produce material to plug an open gap beneath the main gravity section resulting from blowout of the foundation alluvium. An estimated 50,000 yd 3  of rockfill was deposited into the river channel, with the boulders ranging in size from 2 to 40 tons, although considerable smaller-size material would also have been produced by the blast. An additional 6,000 yd 3  of rockfill was excavated from the approach channel for the south (right) spillway and dumped into the river channel upstream from the dam prior to the blast. A thick blanket of fir mattresses (bundles of boughs) was placed on top of the rockfill within 150 feet of the dam to help reduce the seepage beneath the main gravity section, and was overlain by loose rock and earth (silt, sand, and gravel with cobbles and minor boulders) from 1913-14. Hydraulic fill was mined from glacial deposits on the right abutment high above the dam using high-pressure water jets, and transported to the forebay area through a network of flumes and pipelines from 1918-19. Laboratory testing of drill hole samples of the hydraulic fill indicates an average gradation of 66 percent sand, 24 percent gravel, and 10 percent non-plastic, silty fines.   A review of construction photographs suggests cobble-size materials, ranging up to 8 inches in diameter, may comprise 5-15 percent of the fill, and that wooden planks and timbers from the old flume system remain in the fill. In-place densities of all channel fill materials are expected to be low, possibly 70 to 80 pounds per cubic foot (lbs/ft 3 ), with specific gravities of about 2.64. Excavations through granular materials will likely have to be laid back to 2:1 slopes or flatter to insure stability of the fill materials in open cuts.   Bathymetric surveys of the Lake Aldwell forebay area indicated the presence of an irregular, hummocky lobe of landslide material completely blocking the Elwha River channel about 700 feet upstream from the dam, with an estimated volume of 15,000 yd 3  (lobe only). The surface elevation of the slide mass ranges from elevation of 165 feet on the left abutment to elevation of 150 feet over much of the length of the lobe, with a crest length of about 125 feet and a maximum width of about 110 feet. An apparent lack of surface erosion suggests the landslide is relatively young in age and probably dates from initial filling of the reservoir or later.   The landslide materials are probably derived from the granular glacial sediments exposed upslope from the slide mass. Representative exposures of glacial sediments were estimated to contain 50 percent sand, 35 percent gravel, 10 percent non-plastic fines, and about 5 percent cobble with a trace of plus-12-inch boulders. A considerable amount of excavation may be required to achieve a stable slope within the saturated landslide materials. Reservoir draw-down rates during dam removal may have to be limited to allow time for drainage of the landslide materials, to reduce the potential for further landsliding. A reconnaissance-level review of the reservoir rim in March 1995 did not locate any other areas prone to future landsliding. Much of the reservoir shoreline consists of bedrock outcrops or compact glacial sediments which are now considered stable.         B. GLINES CANYON DAM    The foundation of Glines Canyon Dam consists of a basalt bedrock of the Crescent Formation, which directly underlies the entire arch dam section and appurtenant structures. The basalt is very fine-grained with widely-spaced fracturing.   The forebay area was examined by the Pacific Northwest Regional Office dive team using a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV). The examination failed to locate the intake trashrack for the abandoned sluiceway, which is believed to be entombed within reservoir sediments. The ROV camera showed fine sediments at the dam with numerous water-logged trees and woody debris. Bathymetric surveys of the area indicate sediment accumulation to an elevation of 445 feet.           CHAPTER V. HYDROLOGY          A. ELWHA RIVER BASIN    The Elwha River is a coarse-bed stream located on the Olympic Peninsula of northwestern Washington. The river basin is the fourth largest on the peninsula (by drainage area) and has over 100 miles of tributary streams. The river flows northward 45 miles from the base of Mount Olympus to the Strait of Juan de Fuca near the City of Port Angeles, Washington. The river falls about 4,500 feet in elevation to sea level, and has an average annual instantaneous flow of about 1,500 cfs. The watershed has a drainage area of 325 square miles; 83 percent of which is within Olympic National Park. Within the park boundaries, the watershed is pristine and water quality is excellent. The climate of the area is characterized by mild, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers. Average annual rainfall ranges from over 100 inches at the upper end of the watershed area to about 40 inches at the mouth.         B. NORMAL STREAMFLOW    Elwha Dam is located 4.9 river miles upstream from the mouth of the river, and Glines Canyon Dam is located 8.5 river miles upstream from Elwha Dam. Streamflow has been recorded for the Elwha River at the McDonald Bridge gauging station (USGS No. 12045500), located between the two dams and representing a watershed of 269 square miles, for the periods 1898–1902 and 1920-date.   Measurements from 1898-1926 represent unregulated, or natural, flows. Since 1927, the recorded flows reflect regulation by Glines Canyon Dam. Average daily and monthly discharges, by month, recorded at the McDonald Bridge gauge are provided in table 1. Average daily discharges for each calendar day are provided in table 2. A flow distribution for the Elwha River based on daily discharge records from 1920–90 is provided in table 3. Duration tables of two mean daily flows for each month, with exceedance probabilities, are provided in table 4.                     Table 1. — Mean Average Daily and Monthly Discharges, Elwha River †           Month        Daily Average        Monthly Average            Maximum        Minimum            October        *952        2,800        252            November        1,655        4,667        219            December        2,092        5,111        642            January        1,863        4,033        424            February        1,708        3,826        476            March        1,300        3,307        511            April        1,265        2,210        689            May        1,935        3,333        962            June        2,293        4,096        922            July        1,559        2,917        595            August        846        1,642        434            September        618        1,331        330          Source: USGS; measured at the McDonald Bridge gauging station (USGS No. 12045500)     † Period of record Water Years 1898-1901, 1919-94; adjusted for storage since 1927.

FLOODS    Floods in the Elwha River basin are generally the product of rain on saturated ground, and in rare cases, rain on snow-covered ground. The major floods recorded at the stream gauge have generally occurred between November and March, which coincides with the rainy season. Approximately 75 percent of the average annual rainfall occurs during these five months. The largest flood peak ever recorded on the Elwha River was 41,600 cfs on November 18, 1898, which was prior to the construction of the dams. Since dam construction, the largest flood peak recorded was 30,000 cfs on November 26, 1950. Base flow conditions reflect ground-water discharge, and melting of glaciers and residual snowpacks at the higher elevations within the basin.   Frequency floods having 15-day durations were developed for the drainage areas above Glines Canyon Dam, between Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams, and from Elwha Dam to the mouth, for recurrence intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 years (Reclamation, March 1995a). Seasonal flood hydrographs were also developed for the July through October period at Glines Canyon Dam, having probabilities of occurrence of 50, 20, 10, and 5 percent. The computed frequency flood peaks are provided in Tables 5 and 6. The flood hydrographs are provided in Figures 6 through 9.   Both reservoirs on the Elwha River are operated as run-of-the-river projects, with little or no effect on flood peaks. Glines Canyon Dam impounds Lake Mills, which has a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of about 40,500 acre feet at elevation of 590.33 feet (Interior and Commerce, 1994). Capacity and area curves for Lake Mills are provided in Figure 10. Current sediment estimates for Lake Mills would reduce the total storage capacity by about 7,800 acre feet, nearly 20 percent. Elwha Dam impounds Lake Aldwell, which has a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of about 8,100 acre feet at elevation of 197.0 feet (Interior and Commerce, 1994). Area and capacity curves for Lake Aldwell are not available. Revised area and capacity curves for both reservoirs will be developed using final design, based on latest survey data. Current sediment estimates for Lake Aldwell would reduce the total storage capacity by about 2,400 acre feet, nearly 30 percent.         Table 5. — Frequency Flood Peaks, Elwha River  (in cfs)            Recurrence      Interval        Above Glines      Canyon Dam      (255 square miles)        Between Glines and Elwha      (63 square miles)        Elwha Dam      to Mouth      (7 square miles)            2-year        11,821        1,381        505            5-year        19,204        2,243        821            10-year        25,017        2,922        1,069            25-year        33,440        3,905        1,429            50-year        40,519        4,732        1,731            100-year        48,307        5,641        2,064            200-year        56,886        6,643        2,431            500-year        69,578        8,126        2,973                  Table 6. — Seasonal Flood Peaks Above Glines Canyon Dam, Elwha River  (in cfs)            Probability of Occurrence      (percent)         Seasonal Flood Peak      (July-October)            50        4,431            20        7,263            10        9,781            5        12,689          Figure 6. — Flood Hydrographs, Elwha River at Glines Canyon Dam     Available only in full-page 2nd generation hard copy          Figure 7. — Flood Hydrographs, Glines Canyon Dam to Elwha Dam   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy          Figure 8. — Flood Hydrographs, Elwha Dam to Mouth of Elwha River   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy                Figure 9. — Seasonal Flood Hydrographs, Elwha River at Glines Canyon Dam   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy  insert     Figure 10. — Capacity and Area Curves, Glines Canyon Dam    Full-page 2nd generation hard copy                 CHAPTER VI. DISCUSSION OF DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES          A. PREVIOUS STUDIES    1. FERC Draft Staff Report  — The  Draft Staff Report  was issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Office of Hydropower Licensing in March 1993. The  Draft Staff Report  was prepared in response to applications submitted by James River II, Inc. (now James River Corporation) for licenses to operate and maintain the Glines Canyon Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 588) and the Elwha Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 2683). The  Draft Staff Report  includes an evaluation of the potential natural resource benefits, economic costs, and environmental impacts of dam-retention and dam-removal alternatives. Dam-removal alternatives were originally prepared for the damowner by Hosey & Associates Engineering Company (1989). Staff-formulated approaches to dam removal are documented in the  Draft Staff Report . Diversion tunnels were recommended at both damsites for the passage of flood flows up to 3,500 cfs, corresponding to the estimated 10-year, July to September flood. All concrete structures were to be demolished using drill and blast methods, with the rubble used for restoration of site topography or hauled to off-site disposal areas. Estimated costs for the diversion tunnel and structure removal amounted to $12.3 million at Elwha Dam and $5.5 million at Glines Canyon Dam, for a combined estimated cost of $17.8 million(in 1990 dollars). Details of the dam removal alternatives for both damsites are described in Appendix A, Parts 3 and 4 of the  Draft Staff Report .   2. The Elwha Report  —  The Elwha Report  was prepared by agencies of the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and by representatives of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (Tribe), pursuant to Public Law 102-495 for the restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries. The dam removal alternatives presented in  The Elwha Report  were originally prepared by consultants to the Tribe, Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Inc. (November 1991). These studies also assumed the removal of all existing structures from both damsites, using drill and blast methods. Streamflow diversion was to be provided by various methods, for the passage of flood flows up to 5,000 cfs, corresponding to the estimated 2-year, 7-day average flood. Both projects were to be removed concurrently, over a period of 2 to 3 years. Estimated costs for a surface diversion channel and structure removal at Elwha Dam amounted to $8.6 million, and estimated costs for a low-level diversion and structure removal at Glines Canyon Dam amounted to $8.4 million, for a combined estimated cost of $17 million (in 1992 dollars). Details of the dam removal alternatives for both damsites are described in Appendix F of  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994).   The Elwha Report  notes that different vertical control datums were used for the original construction of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. Original elevations for the Elwha Project, recorded on as-built and report drawings, were reported to be 8 feet lower than the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929. Conversely, original elevations for the Glines Canyon Project were reported to be 19.67 feet higher than the NGVD datum. Recent soundings of Lake Mills and reaches of the Elwha River used the NGVD datum. For clarity,  The Elwha Report  related all project feature elevations to the 1929 NGVD datum, referred to as mean sea level. Recent site surveys performed by Reclamation suggest the Elwha project datum is 9.5 feet lower than the NGVD datum.   B. ELWHA DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES    The previous studies for the removal of Elwha Dam required the removal of all structures from the site, including the concrete gravity (main dam) section, intake structure, penstocks, surge tank, powerhouse, and both spillways. Reclamation identified minimum removal requirements at the Elwha damsite for fish passage and public safety, but the cultural significance of the site to the Tribe supported full removal of all features.   Various alternatives for dam removal have been categorized by the method of streamflow diversion used. Previous studies presented in the  Draft Staff Report ,  The Elwha Report , and supporting documents, and recent studies performed by the Dam Removal Task Group, considered several streamflow diversion methods for removal of Elwha Dam, as discussed below.   1. Diversion Tunnel  — The  Draft Staff Report  recommended construction of a 12-foot-diameter, 980-foot-long, concrete-lined tunnel through the left (north) abutment of Elwha Dam (left of the spillway), in combination with incremental notching of the main dam section, for streamflow diversion. A lake tap would be used to extend the tunnel excavation to the reservoir, and a 10- by 14-foot wheel-mounted gate would be installed within a concrete-lined shaft to provide flow control. The reservoir would be drawn down in 5-foot stages by alternating excavations at the north and south spillways to an elevation of 150 feet, after which time the reservoir would be completely drained (during the low flow period) and the main dam and channel fill materials would be removed. The diversion tunnel alternative was believed to afford the greatest degree of downstream safety during the dam-removal and sediment-control activities. This was due to its ability to control reservoir levels and safely pass high flows while minimizing the potential for uncontrolled release of water and sediment through the potentially unstable channel fill materials. Controlled-demolition and surface diversion-channel alternatives were considered to be less reliable. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $12.3 million (1990 dollars).   The Elwha Report  proposed a diversion tunnel through the right (south) abutment of Elwha Dam (right of the spillway), with an intake located upstream of the fill material behind the main dam section and an outlet about 250 feet downstream of the dam. An additional 220-foot-long pipe extension would convey the water beyond a downstream cofferdam. The diversion tunnel would be about 900 feet long and would have a finished diameter of 13 feet. The principal features would include a lake tap, gate shaft with bonneted roller-gate, concrete-lined tunnel, and energy-dissipating structure. Following construction of the diversion tunnel, reservoir levels would be lowered and streamflow would completely bypass the demolition area. The lake tap inlet would be lowered in 10-foot stages by controlled blasting as the reservoir is drawn down. The tunnel and shaft would be plugged following restoration of the river to its natural channel. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $14.5 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group believes significant risk and expense would be associated with the construction of a temporary diversion tunnel at Elwha Dam. Excavation and disturbance of the bedrock was also identified as a concern by the Tribe, due to its cultural significance. Since other streamflow-diversion methods would be technically feasible at a lower cost, the diversion tunnel alternative was eliminated from further consideration.   2. Surface Diversion Channel  —  The Elwha Report  also proposed the excavation of a surface diversion channel on the left (north) abutment to permit streamflow to bypass the dam structures, with reservoir levels controlled by diversion-channel elevations. The reservoir would first be lowered using the existing power penstocks and south spillway (on the right abutment). A cofferdam would be constructed upstream of the north spillway (on the left abutment) to permit removal of the spillway structure and excavation of a diversion channel through bedrock to elevation of 135 feet (20 feet lower than proposed in the  Draft Staff Report ). The cofferdam would be constructed of reinforced rockfill for overtopping protection, with an impermeable geomembrane located on the upstream face. The reservoir would be lowered further by staged excavation of the upstream cofferdam and streamflow diversion through the excavated channel, to permit removal of the remaining structures. Following removal of the dam and restoration of the natural river channel, the diversion channel would be backfilled and revegetated. The estimated cost for the surface diversion channel and structure removal was $8.6 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group selected this basic alternative for further development, based on anticipated costs and likelihood of success. Although higher channel elevations were considered, requiring less rock excavation and larger cofferdams, the analyses favored the deeper rock-cut channel for streamflow diversion, allowing more of the channel fill excavation to be performed under dry conditions.   3. Other Alternatives  — A significant concern for the removal of Elwha Dam is the potential instability of the channel fill materials placed to cutoff seepage beneath the dam during its early history (1912-19; see Appendix A), which if disturbed, could produce a piping failure of the dam foundation similar to that which occurred in 1912. Several options which address this concern were evaluated by the Dam Removal Task Group and are discussed below.  a. River Channel Realignment  — This option would provide a new river channel through the bedrock on the left (north) abutment, along the existing alignment of the north spillway. The new channel would be excavated as necessary to meet fish-passage criteria. The technical advantage of this option is that it avoids disturbing the existing dam and upstream channel fill blanket materials, and thus the potential for piping failure is no greater than under the existing conditions (i.e., minimal). However, this alternative was determined to be unacceptable due to its failure to restore the natural river channel and significant cultural sites within the dam and forebay area, and its excessive excavation and disturbance of bedrock (also of cultural significance).   b. Upstream Cutoff at Dam  — Another option consists of driving large diameter (5-6 feet) piles through the channel fill at the upstream face of the dam and into the bedrock, to reduce the seepage flow and blowout potential during excavation of the channel fill. Although the piles would be driven as close together as possible, a positive seal between the piles would not be provided. Advancing the piles through the rockfill, boulders, and logs in the channel fill could be very difficult, and its effectiveness in controlling seepage beneath the dam could be minimal.   Professor Arthur Casagrande described the effects of imperfect cutoffs and provided equations for calculating cutoff efficiency (Casagrande, 1961). Assuming the depth of channel fill to be cutoff is 70 feet, the base width of the dam is 97 feet, eleven 6-foot-diameter piles are required to cross the channel at the upstream face of the dam, and an average ¼-inch gap remains between the individual piles, the cutoff efficiency would only be 28 percent. That is, 72 percent of the seepage flow occurring without the cutoff piles would still pass through the gaps in the pile wall. If the number of piles required and/or the average width of the gaps increased, the cutoff efficiency would drop to even lower values. Thus, with the potential difficulties in installing the piles, and the questionable effectiveness of the resulting cutoff, this option would not appear to be feasible.   c. Foundation Stabilization at Dam  — A third option includes backfilling the void beneath the dam with cement grout or tremie concrete to stabilize the dam foundation. This option may be difficult to achieve due to the large seepage flow in the channel fill. A material with a controlled set-time (such as a chemical grout) or admixtures would be needed to accelerate the setting time of cement grout or concrete. Shannon and Wilson, Inc. (1968) drilled four holes through the dam in 1967. Three of these holes penetrated the upstream face of the dam at different elevations. Based on the water levels measured in these holes, it was concluded that the primary water barrier is the concrete channel lining (gunite), hydraulic fill, and fir mattresses above elevation of 148 feet, and that the underlying rockfill is essentially free-draining. Shannon and Wilson recommended that no attempt be made to backfill or grout the void space beneath the dam, because this would significantly reduce the existing drainage, change the flow paths, and possibly initiate piping of the underlying sands and gravels. This appears to be a sound interpretation of the data that was collected, and any such treatment would have to strengthen the existing materials below and downstream of the void, as well as fill the void itself.   d. Downstream Berm at Dam  — Construction of a rockfill berm against the toe of the dam was considered to stabilize the foundation of the structure so that the upstream fill could be breached, and the dam notched down, in a controlled fashion. When the dam was reconstructed in 1913, the downstream area was first filled in and a stable-though-pervious condition was attained with the reservoir at an elevation of 118 feet. It appears that the upper 20 feet of the downstream fill has been eroded since the reconstruction due to spillway discharges. If this free-draining fill were to be replaced and strengthened to provide an appropriate safety factor for the higher water level that would exist when the fir mattresses were breached, a stable condition would result. The upstream fill would be slowly breached to monitor the piezometric levels within the dam and the downstream flows. If the piezometric levels and downstream flows increased, it would be necessary to wait until the reservoir recedes and the flows reduce before proceeding with the excavation. Several problems were identified for this option, including:    · the berm would have to resist streamflows and possibly flood flows during notching of the dam,   · a source of rockfill would be needed for the berm construction, and   · removal of the berm materials would be required following demolition of the dam.     e. Restore Sluiceways for Low-level Outlets  — The existing concrete gravity section includes four 5- by 10-foot sluiceway openings with an invert at elevation of 121.5 feet. Although these openings were plugged with concrete within 10 feet of the original iron gates on the upstream face, the plugs could be removed and the low-level release capacity restored with the necessary excavation of the upstream channel fill materials. This upstream excavation within potentially unstable materials could result in a requirement for the passage of flows down a steep-cut slope, unless the iron gates could be restored or replaced to control streamflows. A downstream stability berm would be required to prevent blowout of the foundation materials under the higher reservoir heads. This option presented several technical concerns with no apparent cost savings.   C. GLINES CANYON DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES    The previous studies for the removal of Glines Canyon Dam required the removal of all structures from the site, including the arch dam, thrust block, gravity section, embankment dikes, gated spillway, intake structure, gatehouse, penstock, surge tank, and powerhouse. For the current studies, Reclamation identified minimum removal requirements at the site for fish passage and public safety. The thrust block, gated spillway, and powerhouse were proposed to be retained to minimize the costs of dam removal and provide opportunities for cultural and historical interpretation of the site. Since the dam is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places, this would help minimize the loss of historic resources.   Various alternatives for dam removal have been categorized by the method of streamflow diversion used. Previous studies presented in the  Draft Staff Report ,  The Elwha Report , and recent studies performed by the Dam Removal Task Group, considered several streamflow diversion methods for removal of Glines Canyon Dam, as discussed below.   1. Diversion tunnel  — The  Draft Staff Report  recommended the construction of a 12-foot-diameter, 925-foot-long, concrete-lined tunnel through the left abutment of Glines Canyon Dam, in combination with incremental notching of the main dam section, for streamflow diversion. A lake tap would be used to extend the tunnel excavation to the reservoir, and a 9- by 12-foot wheel-mounted gate would be installed within a concrete-lined shaft to provide flow control. The reservoir would be drawn down in 5-foot stages by alternating excavations between the left and right sides of the concrete arch, with the concrete blasted into the river channel below. Floods in excess of the capacity of the notches and diversion tunnel would overtop the remaining crest of the dam. The additional release capacity of a low-level diversion tunnel was recommended for a conservative estimate without further investigations. The report indicated the most economically desirable option could be simply to lower the dam incrementally using the existing bypass capacity. Other diversion options studied included a surface diversion channel to the existing intake structure, and the construction of a low-level outlet through the arch dam. The majority of the demolition work was to be performed during the low-flow period from July through September. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $5.5 million (1990 dollars).   The Elwha Report  proposed a diversion tunnel through the left (west) abutment of Glines Canyon Dam, with an intake near the existing power tunnel intake and an outlet about 100 feet downstream of the powerplant. The diversion tunnel would be about 800 feet long and would have a finished diameter of 13 feet. The principal features would include a lake tap, gate shaft with bonneted roller-gate, concrete-lined tunnel, and energy-dissipating structure. Following construction of the diversion tunnel, reservoir levels would be lowered and streamflow would completely bypass the demolition area. The lake tap inlet would be lowered in 10-foot stages by controlled blasting as the reservoir is drawn down. A cofferdam constructed just upstream of the tunnel outlet would permit construction of a haul road to the base of the dam for removal of concrete rubble. The diversion tunnel and gate shaft would be plugged following removal of the dam. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $12.4 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group believes significant risk and expense would be associated with the construction of a temporary diversion tunnel at Glines Canyon Dam. Since other streamflow diversion methods would be technically feasible at a lower cost, the diversion tunnel alternative was eliminated from further consideration.   2. Low-level Diversion  —  The Elwha Report  includes an alternative to enlarge the existing 5-foot-diameter sluiceway outlet in the arch dam section. Construction of an enlarged hole through the arch dam would alter stress patterns in the concrete structure. A finite element analysis of the structure by R. W. Beck and Associates in  The Elwha Report  indicated a 10-foot-diameter conduit (13-foot-diameter excavation) constructed through the arch dam would not overstress the concrete or cause a rupture of the structure. Construction of the new outlet would require the underwater removal of the existing trashrack and lake sediments, and the installation of a large steel bulkhead on the upstream face of the dam. Reservoir releases would continue to be made through the power penstock until completion of the new outlet. Reservoir releases through the new outlet would be controlled to an elevation of 460 feet by a 117-inch-diameter fixed-cone valve. Below elevation of 460 feet, streamflow would pass through gated notches in the remaining portion of the dam in a progressive stepped approach, as described below. The estimated cost for the low-level outlet and structure removal was $8.4 million (1992 dollars).   The  Draft Staff Report  briefly described a similar diversion alternative, requiring a new 7.5-foot-diameter outlet through the arch section with a 6-foot-diameter regulating valve for low-level releases, but structural analyses were not performed to confirm feasibility.   Although the Dam Removal Task Group felt this alternative would be technically feasible, the element of risk associated with underwater construction, and the probable interference of debris and sediments at the upstream face of the dam on the bulkhead installation and operation of the outlet, would be of concern. There did not seem to be a clear advantage in construction costs for this alternative, and design costs would be higher for the necessary finite element analyses.   3. Notches Through Dam  — A third alternative proposed in  The Elwha Report  would allow streamflow to pass through gated notches in the dam structure at various elevations, allowing reservoir levels to be progressively lowered in stages. After lowering the reservoir using the spillway and power penstock, the portion of the structure above the reservoir level would be demolished and removed, using either a barge or a boom crane. This concept assumes the power penstock would first be modified at the powerplant by the installation of an 11-foot-diameter fixed-cone valve for reservoir releases above elevation of 515 feet. Construction of nine gated notches at 12.5-foot intervals between sill elevations 490 and 390 feet (streambed) was assumed to require the underwater installation of a large steel bulkhead at each notch location. An 18- by 25-foot slide gate would be installed at the upstream end of each notch to facilitate removal of the bulkhead and to regulate releases for sediment management. A stability analysis of the arch dam was performed to demonstrate safe passage of a 25,000 cfs flow through a 17-foot-wide by 25-foot-deep notch with 15 feet of surcharge over the dam crest. The estimated cost for the structure removal utilizing gated notches was $9.1 million (1992 dollars).   The recommended alternative in the  Draft Staff Report  included incremental notching of the dam in combination with the construction of a diversion tunnel. The notches would each cover one-half the crest length of the dam, alternating from side to side at 10-foot intervals to the riverbed.   The Dam Removal Task Group selected this basic alternative for further development, based on anticipated costs and likelihood of success. Elimination of the proposed powerplant modifications for installation of an 11-foot-diameter fixed-cone valve would lower the estimated cost in  The Elwha Report  to about $7.6 million. Penstock releases could be controlled by the existing wicket gates, with the turbine runner removed to ensure operating capability under no-load conditions. A non-gated notch alternative which could be constructed without an upstream bulkhead could produce further cost savings, provided the objectives of the sediment management plan could still be achieved.   4. Other Alternatives  — The  Draft Staff Report  and  The Elwha Report  briefly discussed a channel bypass alternative which would use the existing power intake and penstock for streamflow diversion. A small diversion embankment would divert flows at the upper end of the reservoir into a trapezoidal channel running along the west edge of the reservoir for 8,000 to 9,000 feet. The  Draft Staff Report  indicated the channel would have a 23-foot bottom width and 1:1 sideslopes, with a capacity of 3,500 cfs. Numerous potential problems and very high construction costs were identified for this alternative, and no further studies were performed.   The Dam Removal Task Group looked at potential variations of the basic dam removal alternatives for Glines Canyon Dam documented in the earlier reports. Construction sequence, structure removal requirements, concrete demolition methods, and waste disposal opportunities were all investigated.   Previous studies assumed a construction sequence for which both dams would be removed at the same time, to shorten the overall construction schedule. However, if the removal of Glines Canyon Dam did not begin until after the removal of Elwha Dam, a flood surcharge space could be provided in the upstream reservoir (Lake Mills) to provide a flood control benefit for the Elwha Dam operations. Downstream releases could then be regulated using the spillway gates and power penstock at Glines Canyon Dam, to reduce the river control costs for removal of Elwha Dam. The relatively small storage capacity of the downstream reservoir (Lake Aldwell) would reduce its potential value as a sediment trap for removal of Glines Canyon Dam first, and anadromous fish passage upstream from Freshwater Bay is not improved until Elwha Dam is removed. The recommended dam removal plan retains Glines Canyon Dam until the completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, for flood control benefits during the early excavation operations. Dam removal at both sites would be completed by November of the second year.   Minimum structure removal requirements for river restoration at Glines Canyon Dam include the removal of the majority of the arch dam section between the rock abutments and above the streambed. Portions of the arch dam abutments and base could possibly remain to the extent they are shown to be stable and outside minimum channel limits to accommodate flood flows and fish passage.   To ensure public safety, the log boom, trashrack tower, and surge tank tower should be removed, and the openings for the power penstock tunnel and gate shaft should be sealed. In addition, minimum removal requirements include the removal of any hazardous materials and much of the electrical equipment from the powerplant area, including transmission poles and overhead wires. The left abutment spillway and the right abutment thrust block, gravity section, and earthfill embankment may be left intact to serve as a public overlook for interpretation of the damsite, and the powerplant structure may be modified to serve as an interpretive center. The existing wood-frame structures on the left abutment may be found to be useful during and following construction for various purposes.   Previous studies assumed concrete demolition would be performed using conventional drill-and-blast techniques. A variety of alternative demolition methods were evaluated for the current studies, including diamond-wire sawcutting, stitch drilling, chemical splitting, hoe-ramming, high-pressure water-blasting, flame-cutting, and combinations of these methods (see Appendix F). The diamond-wire sawcutting and hoe-ramming methods of concrete demolition seemed to provide some potential advantages, warranting further study. Diamond-wire sawcutting was extensively used to breach Waddell Dam, a multiple-arch concrete dam in Arizona, under a negotiated contract for Reclamation. Bluebird Dam, a 58-foot-high concrete arch dam located within the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, was completely demolished using a boom-mounted hydraulic impact hammer (""hoe-ram"").   The size and shape of concrete waste materials, and the associated handling and disposal requirements, are dependent upon the material composition (strength and presence of reinforcing steel) and demolition method selected. While concrete rubble would result from blasting and hoe-ramming, sawcutting would produce smooth-faced blocks of large sizes. Previous studies assumed concrete rubble would be removed using a barge on the reservoir, or trucks on a downstream haul road within the river channel. A downstream haul would only be feasible when streamflow diversion is provided by the power penstock or by a diversion tunnel, and would be located between the existing powerplant and the base of the arch dam section. The removal of Bluebird Dam used air-lifting extensively, while large cranes or cableways could serve the narrow Glines Canyon site effectively. Conveyor belts would possibly be feasible for shorter haul distances and for smaller materials. Waste materials would be disposed of in either land or ocean sites, or commercial uses could be found for some of the materials. Steel items could probably be salvaged for recycling, and possibly some of the equipment could be salvaged for its historical or commercial value.           CHAPTER VII. PROPOSED PLANS FOR DAM REMOVAL          The Dam Removal Task Group developed the following dam removal plans for the feasibility-level designs and cost estimates. These plans are considered to be technically feasible, economical, and compatible with the sediment management plans and project objectives. Negotiated procurement is recommended for future contracting of the demolition work, by which technical proposals would be solicited for selection based on both technical merit and cost (see Chapter XI). This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan.         A. ELWHA DAM    1. Decommissioning of powerplant  — This would include any work at the Elwha Dam powerplant required in advance of the dam removal contract work, including de-energizing the electrical equipment, preparing selected equipment for long-term storage, removing hazardous materials, re-routing transmission lines, replacing the grounding grid for the electric power utility, and removing smaller items of historical value. The turbine runners would be removed from the two vertical units (3 and 4) to permit no-load releases through the 15-foot-diameter penstock. This work would be performed under contract. Hazardous waste collection and disposal is covered in Chapter VIII, Section A.   2. Site access and mobilization  — The right (south) abutment of Elwha Dam can be accessed by an existing, unpaved road off of State Highway 112, located just east of a bridge over the Elwha River. Site access improvements may be required for approximately 0.4 miles of permanent road, for widening as necessary to accommodate construction traffic, and for normal maintenance of the roadway surface and drainage culverts during the contract period. No other improvements to the existing road are anticipated.   Access to the left abutment of Elwha Dam is currently provided by an existing single-lane timber bridge across the dam crest from the right abutment. This access will disappear soon after the dam removal work begins. Alternate access may be provided by an old horse trail/logging road crossing the left abutment ridge from Dan Kelly Road off of State Highway 112, across public (Washington State Department of Natural Resources) and private land. Significant improvements to the roadway width and grade would be required for a distance of over 1.2 miles for this trail to be used for equipment travel, including the construction of at least one culvert crossing to reroute a small creek. Although the cost estimate for dam removal assumes the use of a floating bridge (""flexifloat"") for construction access to the left abutment for a period of time before the reservoir is drained (currently estimated at 75 days), the alternate left abutment access road should be investigated further during final design.   Temporary haul roads will be required to be established within the forebay area for excavation of the channel fill materials, with a small allowance included in the cost estimate. Maximum grades should generally not exceed 12 percent.   Mobilization costs are estimated to represent about 5 percent of the cost of dam removal, and would include costs for a dragline and two large mobile cranes with 200-foot booms. Crane pads will be required on the intake structure for removal of the left (north) spillway gates and the penstocks, on the right abutment for removal of the south spillway gates, and near the powerhouse for removal of the mechanical and electrical equipment. Construction power is assumed to be supplied by a single 150 kVA engine-generator, although alternate sources of electric power may be available. The cost of supplying electric power from the local utility or from the Bonneville Power Administration should be investigated during final design.   The current estimate assumes no constraints on construction activities will be necessary for protection of threatened and endangered species. Potential nesting sites for the spotted owl and marbled murrelet (both threatened and endangered species) exist near the State Highway 112 bridge and in the upper reservoir area. Observation of these nesting areas by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service occurred during the 1995 nesting season (May 1-August 15) and is planned for the same period in 1996. If these nests are found to be active, ""permits to take"" (issued by the Service) should be investigated in lieu of placing noise limits and other constraints on the construction activities. Estimates of blasting parameters for removal of Elwha Dam were developed by Reclamation for use in modeling environmental noise levels during construction. The results of this model are reported in Appendix G, ""Estimated Blasting Parameters for Noise Analysis — Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams.""   3. Streamflow diversion  — A surface diversion channel will be excavated through the left (north) spillway channel to lower the reservoir level for removal of the concrete gravity section from the original river channel and much of the fill material from the forebay area. Details of the proposed diversion plan are provided in the following paragraphs. The discharge capacity of the proposed surface diversion channel is shown in Figure 11. Average daily discharges are assumed for purposes of estimating reservoir levels and diversion requirements.   The contractor is assumed to begin site mobilization in November, continuing through the winter months. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control to the maximum possible extent during this period, passing normal inflow through the power penstock while using available reservoir storage in Lake Mills to reduce flood peaks. Lake Aldwell would be drawn down by March 1 to an elevation of 182 feet, using the right (south) spillway and the 15-foot-diameter penstock for reservoir releases. A temporary cofferdam (about 8-10 feet high) would be constructed within the left (north) spillway approach channel about 300 feet upstream from the dam for unwatering of the channel area to permit removal of the concrete lining (gunite cap). A double-wall sheet-pile cofferdam (about 20 feet high) would be constructed across the approach channel from the left abutment to the existing concrete block (within 100 feet of the north spillway), for construction access to a crane pad on the intake structure and for flood protection. The sheet-piles would be driven to bedrock to provide a positive cutoff. The north spillway gate structure would be removed, and a diversion channel would be excavated within bedrock to an elevation of 135 feet. A dragline would be used within the reservoir upstream of the sheet-pile cofferdam for excavation of the temporary cofferdam and channel fill materials (sands and gravels), as necessary, to establish a deeper approach channel.   Following the spring runoff (May and June), the reservoir would again be lowered to an elevation of 182 feet. The construction of a smaller gravity wall (about 8 to 10 feet high) immediately downstream of the sheet-pile cofferdam would permit the removal of the sheet-pile cofferdam under a balanced reservoir head. The cofferdam foundation would remain as a bedrock plug within the diversion channel. The right half of the gravity wall would be breached during the low-flow period (beginning in August), lowering the reservoir to an elevation of 174 feet (below the power penstock intake sill). The gravity wall could be constructed from precast concrete blocks (DoublewalÔ units) used previously for construction of the temporary cofferdam.   Using the left half of the gravity wall as a working platform, a portion of the bedrock plug would be excavated (by blasting) to a maximum depth of 15 feet below the water surface, releasing an instantaneous peak flow of up to 3,000 cfs and lowering the reservoir to an elevation of 167 feet within a matter of hours. Subsequent drilling and blasting of the channel plug in stages from the bedrock surface would lower the reservoir to elevations of 160, 152, 144, and 139 feet, within a 2-3 week period.   Streamflow diversion would continue through the newly excavated channel for one full year while the channel fill materials are removed. Reservoir levels for average streamflow conditions will vary between elevations of 138 and 144 feet. The excavated surface of the concrete gravity section would remain above the level of the channel fill for flood protection, until the channel fill becomes predominantly rockfill and erosion-resistant. After the channel fill materials have been excavated to about an elevation of 145 feet, the remaining portion of the concrete gravity section would be removed to an elevation of about 90 feet. During the low-flow period of the second year, excavation within the channel fill materials would progress below the water level within the diversion channel, resulting in the diversion of streamflow along its original course through the damsite. The river channel would be lowered in 2-foot increments along its full length until reaching the desired grade at an elevation of 95 feet. This work would be performed over a 3-month period from August through October.   4. Structure removal  — All concrete structures will be either removed or buried at Elwha Dam, and the left (north) spillway outlet channel will be backfilled to restore the site to approximate pre-dam conditions. Wood-frame structures will be retained for use during the demolition contract, then removed. All mechanical and electrical items, timber, glass, fencing, and hazardous materials will be removed from the site for disposal. The structure removal plan for Elwha Dam consists of four stages described below, and as depicted on drawings 1440-D-150 through -153 (Appendix C).   Stage One — Surface Diversion Channel Development  (see Drawing 1440-D-150)  a. With the reservoir at its normal level, provide construction access to the left abutment using a floating bridge (""flexifloat"") from the right abutment. Alternative access may be provided by a barge from the right abutment or from the Indian Creek boat ramp (located at the upper end of the reservoir), or by construction of a temporary access road from State Highway 112 along an existing trail (about 1.2 miles) as described in Section 2 above. Deliver a mobile crane, bulldozer, and other equipment as needed to the left abutment. Remove the log boom as required.   b. Draw the reservoir down to the lowest possible level using both spillways and the 15-foot-diameter penstock (units 3 and 4). (Glines Canyon Dam will be operated for flood control during this period to the maximum possible extent.)   c. Establish a temporary stockpile area on the left abutment with a storage capacity of about 3,400 yd 3 . Construct an access road to the left (north) spillway approach channel area (maximum 12 percent grade).   d. Construct an 8- to 10-foot-high temporary cofferdam at the upstream end of the left (north) spillway approach channel as required to unwater the channel area. Twenty-four precast concrete DoublewalÔ units (or a similar product), backfilled with pervious sand and gravel were assumed for the cost estimate. Each precast unit is 4 feet high, 8 feet long, and 8 feet wide, with a weight of about 5 tons. Remove the exposed concrete channel lining (gunite cap) between the temporary cofferdam and the north spillway, and place the concrete rubble (about 300 yd 3 ) in the temporary stockpile area. Maintain diversion releases through the south (right) spillway and 15-foot-diameter penstock.   e. With the temporary cofferdam in place, construct from the left abutment a 20-foot-wide, double-wall sheet-pile cofferdam across the north spillway approach channel to the existing concrete block (elevation of 196 feet). Drive sheet piles through the existing fill (surface elevation of 175 feet) to refusal in bedrock (approximate elevation of 170 feet). Using tiebacks for structural support, backfill the sheet-pile cofferdam with clean sand and/or gravel from a local commercial source (assumed necessary to avoid the processing of available site materials). The total weight of sheet-piles and tiebacks assumed for the cost estimate is 200,000 pounds, with 2,000 yd 3  of pervious backfill required. Drill and blast any bedrock within the surface diversion channel limits upstream from the sheet-pile cofferdam foundation to an elevation of 135 feet, but leave the shotrock in place.   f. Permanently close the slide gates for the two 9.5-foot-diameter power penstocks. Construct a 40-foot-wide crane pad between the existing concrete block and the intake structure, using additional sheet piles and pervious backfill. Remove the temporary cofferdam from the approach channel before the reservoir rises, and stockpile the precast concrete units and backfill materials for later use.   g. Move the mobile crane with 200-foot boom from the left abutment, across the sheet-pile cofferdam, and onto the crane pad. Remove the 9.5-foot-diameter penstock pipe sections using cutting torches, a bulldozer, and the crane. Deliver the penstock pipe sections to the existing access bridge on the dam crest (or to an alternate location) for removal by a second mobile crane and subsequent delivery to a flatbed truck on the main access road.   h. Remove the four spillway gates and the gate hoist using the mobile cranes (as was done for the penstock pipe sections). Demolish the left (north) spillway gate structure and excavate the downstream portion of the diversion channel to invert elevation of 135 feet. Drill and blast the reinforced concrete structure in 1 or 2 shots, then blast the bedrock in 3 or 4 layers. Move an estimated 2,900 yd 3  of concrete rubble and 7,600 yd 3  of rock fill to the adjoining penstock site. Pile the waste materials outside the right wall of the left (north) spillway and upstream from the concrete wall at the powerhouse to a stable configuration, using a bulldozer. The stockpile area on the left abutment may also be used for temporary waste disposal. Concrete gravity walls downstream from the gate structure and outside the limits of the diversion channel may be left in place.         Stage Two — Streamflow Diversion and Powerhouse Demolition  (see Drawing 1440-D-151)   a. Construct a temporary gravity wall at the toe of the sheet-pile cofferdam (between the cofferdam and the cutslope for the diversion channel) to the reservoir surface elevation. Thirty-four precast concrete DoublewalÔ units (or a similar product) backfilled with pervious sand and gravel (as used for the upstream cofferdam) were assumed for the cost estimate.   b. Equalize the reservoir head on both sides of the sheet-pile cofferdam by filling the interspace between the cofferdam and the gravity wall with water. Breach the sheet-pile cofferdam by removing the sheet piles using a crane (starting at either end). Remove the sheet piles and backfill materials from the site. Leave the bedrock channel plug in place.   c. Breach the temporary gravity wall by removing 23 precast concrete units from the right half of the structure, and place 22 of the precast units at the upstream face of the left half of the structure (on the bedrock channel plug). This will provide a large working platform above the left half of the bedrock channel plug for operation of drilling equipment. Streamflow will begin to pass through the diversion channel above the bedrock surface (elevation of 170 feet), and possibly through the 15-foot-diameter penstock (depending upon the inflow rate).   d. Excavate an approach channel within the reservoir to an elevation of 135 feet, from the landslide area (approximately 800 feet upstream from the dam) to the bedrock channel plug. A bottom width of about 40 feet and 2:1 slopes in the existing hydraulic fill materials were assumed, representing an in-place volume of about 60,000 yd 3 . The northern channel slope will be formed by the existing bedrock face. The required excavation of the channel fill materials (sands and gravels) may be performed from a floating bridge or barge, using a dragline or clamshell. Excavated materials will either be hauled directly off-site to an approved disposal area, or placed temporarily within the right spillway approach channel for later removal. The cost estimate assumes the excavated materials are placed in the approach channel area for later removal.   e. With the upstream and downstream channels excavated to an elevation of 135 feet, begin controlled blasting of the bedrock channel plug in five stages from elevation of 170 feet to elevation of 135 feet. The first stage will be drilled from the working platform area, and will include removal of the precast concrete units and a portion of the bedrock to an elevation of 160 feet. A trapezoidal channel will be created with a bottom width of about 15 feet, and will lower the reservoir surface below an elevation of 170 feet. The second, third, and fourth stages will be drilled from the bedrock surface at an elevation of 170 feet, to elevations of 152, 144, and 135 feet, respectively. The fifth stage will remove the benches remaining from the previous stages to produce the final channel width of 30 feet, allowing the reservoir water levels to stabilize between each stage at increasingly lower elevations. Following each blast, excavated rock will be washed downstream, to be removed from the diversion channel and dumped onto the penstock site using the crane and a clamshell bucket. The total in-place volume of the bedrock within the diversion channel plug is about 2,400 yd 3 . (The removal of Glines Canyon Dam can begin following the successful completion of the diversion channel at Elwha Dam.) Sediment releases will be initiated from Lake Aldwell during this period.   f. Following lowering of the reservoir below the intake sill elevation, close the remaining slide gates and remove the 15-foot-diameter penstock using cutting torches, a bulldozer, and the crane.   g. Construct a temporary ramp fill from the existing concrete block (elevation of 196 feet) to the existing right spillway channel (elevation of 178 feet) at a maximum grade of 15 percent, using materials excavated for the upstream approach channel or other local materials within the forebay area. With the diversion channel safely established at elevation of 135 feet, move the crane down the temporary ramp to the right channel area. Remove the sheet-piles and pervious backfill used for the crane pad.   h. Using the crane on the right abutment or in the right channel area, demolish the south (right) spillway, and excavate the concrete gravity section to an elevation of 170 feet. Remove the timber access bridge, five spillway gates, and gate hoist using the crane(s) and remove the materials from the site using flatbed trucks. Drill and blast the reinforced concrete spillway structure in 1 or 2 shots, and excavate the upper portion of the concrete gravity section in 3 or 4 layers. Remove an estimated 2,200 yd 3  of reinforced concrete rubble from the spillway location, and an estimated 2,200 yd 3  of concrete rubble from the upper portion of the gravity section, to an approved disposal site. Also remove the remaining portions of the concrete channel lining (gunite cap) from the forebay area (400 yd 3 ).   i. Construct a short ramp and an access road from the right channel area, across the south spillway foundation and lowered gravity section, to the left abutment. Limit the maximum grade to 15 percent. The width of the gravity section at an elevation of 170 feet is about 28 feet. Move the crane from the right channel area to a left abutment crane pad above the existing powerhouse.   j. Construct a downstream cofferdam within the river between the powerhouse and the spillway channel as needed to unwater the powerhouse tailrace area. An estimated volume of 3,500 yd 3  would be required to provide an embankment having a 10-foot crest width and 2:1 slopes. Install a geomembrane lining to serve as a water barrier.   k. Remove the surge tank, remaining portions of the penstocks, and all mechanical and electrical equipment from the powerhouse using the left abutment crane and bulldozer. The larger items must be cut down to more manageable sizes for handling purposes. Place items at a suitable point for removal using the right abutment crane, or for hauling directly from the site in trucks across the lowered gravity section. Remove all window glass from the powerhouse. Demolish the powerhouse superstructure and dump an estimated 2,600 yd 3  of reinforced concrete rubble onto the penstock site. Blast the powerhouse substructure concrete (5,000 yd 3 ) into the tailrace basin. This will minimize hauling requirements and provide suitable materials for channel backfill at the site.         Stage Three — Dam and Hydraulic Fill Removal  (See Drawing 1440-D-152)  a. Move the crane from the left abutment across the lowered concrete gravity section to the right channel area. Leave the bulldozer on the left abutment. Remove the temporary ramp fill (from stage two) and excavate the upstream channel (hydraulic fill) materials in the dry to an elevation of 145 feet. Fill materials will mainly consist of sands and gravels, but may include some larger rockfill and the fir mattresses, for an estimated in-place volume of 50,000 yd 3 . Temporary haul roads must be established within the channel for hauling fill materials to the main access road. Also demolish the concrete block between the left and right channels, and dump an estimated 1,900 yd 3  of concrete rubble onto the penstock site.   b. Demolish the remaining portion of the concrete gravity (main dam) section in lifts to an elevation of 90 feet. The excavated surface of the gravity section should remain above the level of the upstream channel fill materials for flood protection purposes, until the channel fill near the dam becomes predominantly rockfill and erosion-resistant. The feasibility design assumes rockfill will be encountered at an elevation of about 145 feet, at which point the gravity section can be removed to the final grade. A 2:1 slope is assumed in the rockfill between elevation of 145 feet and elevation of 90 feet just upstream from the dam, bounded by the existing rock cliffs on both ends. An estimated 14,500 yd 3  of concrete rubble (based on an assumed swell factor of 1.35) will be removed from the dam, to be dumped onto the penstock site using the crane and a skipfor later placement as backfill within the diversion channel.   c. Perform any final shaping or excavation work necessary within the river channel between the damsite and the downstream cofferdam, especially the concrete rubble at the powerhouse site, and possibly the concrete-filled caisson near the toe of the gravity section. Breach the downstream cofferdam and place the rockfill/riprap along the left side of the river channel for future erosion protection. Remove the geomembrane liner.         Stage Four — Final Channel Excavation and Site Cleanup  (see Drawing 1440-D-153)  a. Following the spring runoff period (May and June), excavate the rockfill materials within the original river channel from the damsite to the diversion channel in about 2-foot increments from elevation of 145 to 135 feet, diverting streamflow from the diversion channel to the original river channel. A portion of the excavated materials may have to be stockpiled at the penstock site above the diversion channel for subsequent backfilling of the channel.   b. During the low-flow period (August through October), complete the excavation of channel fill materials along the original river channel and through the upstream landslide area as required to establish the final streambed grade. The total in-place volume of channel fill materials below elevation of 145 feet is estimated to be about 45,000 yd 3  of rockfill (near the dam) and about 45,000 yd 3  of sands and gravels (further upstream).   c. Demolish the intake structure on the left abutment by blasting in lifts, and push the concrete rubble into the diversion channel using the bulldozer. Shape the backfill materials within the diversion channel/north spillway channel/penstock site to the desired contours. Spread stockpiled material (dirt, rocks, etc.) across the left abutment area to a minimum depth of 2 feet over waste concrete materials, and provide desired final, natural-looking contours with slopes of 2:1 or flatter. Place topsoil over the left abutment site as required and seed. Remove the bulldozer from the left abutment area by airlift or other means as necessary.   d. Remove all remaining site buildings (maintenance shop building on right abutment, garage on left abutment), fencing, and other improvements as required.   5. Excavation of channel fill  — As described previously, the channel fill consists primarily of hydraulic fill (sands and gravels) and large rockfill, but includes fir mattresses and a reinforced concrete cap. The channel fill materials may be excavated by mechanical means as discussed in the previous section, much of which to be performed either underwater or in saturated conditions. Significant cost savings may be realized if some of the channel fill materials are permitted to erode downstream, particularly within the approach channel for the diversion channel above elevation of 135 feet, rather than requiring mechanical excavation and removal to land disposal sites. This alternative will be evaluated further during final design, using geologic data additional to that currently available. An estimated potential savings of about $800,000 could be realized if 50,000 yd 3  of sand and gravel could be eroded rather than mechanically excavated and transported to a disposal site.   6. Waste disposal  — Suitable sites for disposal of waste concrete and materials (dirt, rocks, etc.) are being investigated within 10 miles of Elwha Dam. On-site burial of up to 25,000 yd 3  of concrete, including the retention of the north spillway gravity walls, the penstock saddles and thrust blocks, and minor concrete placements, result in an estimated potential savings to the project of about $500,000. The cost estimate assumes all waste concrete removed from the damsite is dumped at an approved disposal site without further handling. Additional costs to crush concrete to an average 1½-inch size for off-site disposal (with any reinforcing steel removed) may range from about $7 to $14 per cubic yard, depending upon the size of the broken fragments. If such crushing is found to be necessary, the costs for removal of Elwha Dam could increase by an estimated $100,000 or more.   The steel penstocks, surge tank, Tainter gates, and slide gates would probably be salvaged for recycling. Hazardous materials would be sent to an approved disposal site. Other items would be salvaged for historical or commercial value, or buried in a landfill.   7. Site restoration  — All waste materials remaining on site would be buried under a minimum of 2 feet of material (dirt, rocks, etc.) and shaped to natural-looking contours. Materials suitable for use as topsoil would be spread over the site and seeded as required. Normal rainfall rates should be sufficient to support revegetation.   Following site restoration, the river channel upstream from the damsite should be able to contain streamflow up to 50,000 cfs below the diversion channel invert at elevation of 135 feet. This flow rate would correspond to greater than a 50-year flood. The seepage potential through the channel backfill on the left abutment would therefore be fairly remote, but not impossible. If necessary, a concrete cutoff wall could be constructed within the diversion channel to provide full protection from channel seepage.         Figure 11. — Elwha Dam, Diversion Channel Discharge Curve   available only in 2nd generation hard copy   B. GLINES CANYON DAM    1. Decommissioning of powerplant  — This would include any work at the Glines Canyon Dam powerplant required in advance of the dam removal contract work, including de-energizing the electrical equipment, removing hazardous materials, rerouting transmission lines, and removing the turbine runner from the main unit to permit no-load releases through the power penstock. Hazardous waste collection and disposal is discussed in Chapter VIII, Section A.   2. Site access and mobilization  — The left (west) abutment of Glines Canyon Dam is accessed by an existing paved, two-lane road (Olympic Hot Springs Road) from U.S. Highway 101. A bridge located downstream from the dam across the Elwha River is suitable for highway loads. One lane of the existing road within the park was lost in March 1995 due to a slope failure along the river, with access limited to the remaining lane. This study assumes permanent repairs will be completed to the access road prior to award of the dam removal contract. Several site-access improvements may be required for about the last 0.2 miles of permanent road up to the left abutment. These include widening (as necessary) to accommodate construction traffic and normal maintenance of the roadway surface and drainage culverts during the contract period. Access roads to the powerhouse and the switchyard are provided from the main access road and are unpaved. Additional improvements to the main access road are discussed in Chapter VIII, Section C.   Access to the right abutment of Glines Canyon Dam is provided by an existing unpaved, single-lane road (Whiskey Bend Road) which branches off from the main access road near the Elwha Ranger Station. Contractor access to the right abutment of the dam is not currently expected to be required.   A temporary haul road may be required along the river channel between the dam and the powerhouse tailrace for removal of waste concrete, rock, and other debris during the low-flow period following dam removal.   Mobilization costs are estimated to represent about 5 percent of the cost of dam removal, plus an additional estimated $160,000 for mobilization of a large ringer crane (which for stability and load distribution uses a circular support pad rather than outriggers) with 300-foot boom to the left abutment. A large crane pad and contractor staging area would be required on the left abutment, to be constructed using materials from the existing earth embankment at the site. The ringer crane will require a level pad approximately 48 feet in diameter (36-foot-diameter ring plus 6 feet of clearance around the periphery). Several large trees must be removed to permit full access of the site using the crane.   Construction power is assumed to be supplied by a single 150 kVA engine-generator, although alternate sources of electric power may be available. The cost of supplying electric power from the local utility (Clallam County Public Utility District) or from Bonneville Power Administration will be investigated during final design.   The current estimate assumes no constraints on construction activities will be necessary for protection of Threatened and Endangered species. Potential nesting sites for the spotted owl and marbled murrelet (both Threatened and Endangered species) exist in the vicinity of the project. Observation of these nesting areas by the Service occurred during the 1995 nesting season (May 1 to August 15) and are planned for the same period in 1996. If these nests are found to be active, ""permits to take"" (issued by the Service) should be investigated in lieu of placing noise limits and other constraints on the construction activities. Estimates of blasting parameters for removal of Glines Canyon Dam were developed by Reclamation for use in modeling environmental noise levels during construction. The results of this modeling are reported in Appendix G.   The NPS may decide to close the Elwha basin to all visitor use during the demolition contract, to minimize operational problems. This would include the closure of campgrounds and restriction of vehicle use. A shuttle service could be operated to transport visitors to upper trailheads and for sightseeing. The cost estimate assumes the contractor’s demolition activities would not be adversely impacted by park visitors.   3. Streamflow diversion  — A series of ungated notches will be excavated within the arch dam section below the draw-down limits of the existing power penstock, to lower the reservoir level for removal of the dam. Details of the proposed diversion plan are provided in the following paragraphs. The discharge capacity of the ungated, 25-foot-wide notches is shown in Figure 12. Average daily discharges are assumed for purposes of estimating reservoir levels and diversion requirements.   The contractor is assumed to begin site mobilization in November. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control to the maximum possible extent until July of the following year, passing normal inflow through the power penstock (and spillway, if necessary) while using available reservoir storage in Lake Mills to reduce flood peaks. Reservoir releases would be controlled as necessary to facilitate construction of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam. Following completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, excavation of the arch dam section at Glines Canyon Dam would commence, with the reservoir held at the lowest possible level during the demolition activities.   When the arch dam has been excavated to the reservoir level, a single notch having a bottom width of 25 feet will be excavated at the left abutment to a maximum depth of 15 feet below the reservoir level by controlled blasting. Initial blasting will be confined within the limits of the notch between the downstream face and no closer than 3 feet from the upstream face, with blasting mats used to contain the concrete rubble on the dam crest for removal. The final blasting will remove the upstream face of the notch in four segments, limiting the rate of increase in reservoir outflow to about 1,000 cfs per hour. The peak flows will attenuate quickly as the reservoir level drops. The rate of reservoir drawdown will be dependent upon the inflow and reservoir storage capacity, but should generally permit lowering the reservoir level about 8 feet within two days. Downstream flood warnings will be provided prior to blasting each notch.   Notches (for streamflow diversion) would continue to be excavated from the arch dam section at 7.5-foot increments between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet, alternating between the left and right abutments. Assuming no demolition work would be performed during the three months total from November 15 to December 15 and May 1 to June 30, average inflow during the remaining 9 months of the year would be about 1,300 cfs. Although the construction schedules and cost estimates assume an average notch width of 25 feet and a minimum discharge capacity of 1,400 cfs with 7.5 feet of head, actual notches may be sized according to diversion requirements. Reservoir inflow in excess of the notch capacity would cause the reservoir level to rise and demolition work to be temporarily suspended. Overtopping of the partially-excavated arch dam section during flood flows would not cause damage to the structure or downstream channel.   The reservoir level would drop in 7.5-foot increments at intervals ranging between one week and one month, depending upon the layer elevation and reservoir inflow. Excavation of the lower portion of the arch dam section (including the final two layers and the base of the dam) would be performed during August and September of the second year when streamflow would be at a minimum. Final channel cleanup would be completed by late October.   4. Structure removal  — Each structure at Glines Canyon Dam was evaluated for possible retention, based on anticipated effects on ecosystem and fisheries restoration, historic and cultural mitigation, visitor safety, maintenance costs, demolition costs, esthetics, and opportunities for site interpretation. Structures recommended for removal from the site include the arch dam section, the penstock intake structure/trashrack tower, the surge tank tower, the transformer yard and shed, the left abutment earthfill embankment, and the boat house. Other structures will be retained, with necessary modifications, as described in Section 6 below. The structure removal plan for Glines Canyon Dam consists of four stages as described below, and as depicted on Drawings 1440-D-154 and 1440-D-155.   Removal of the arch dam section is assumed to be performed using both conventional blasting and diamond-wire sawcutting methods, for estimating purposes. Diamond-wire sawcutting will provide smooth surfaces for the concrete structures to be retained on both abutments, facilitate excavation of reinforced portions of the arch dam section, improve control of the excavation grade, provide smooth working surfaces for excavation of each layer, and permit removal of the concrete in large blocks (rather than attempting to confine rubble to the working surface and removing the rubble by loading skips).  Stage One — Diversion Through Penstock, Remove Layers 1-7  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)   a. Draw the reservoir down to its lowest possible level using the spillway and the power penstock. The existing spillway will remain available for the passage of large floods above the spillway crest, elevation of 570.33 feet. The power penstock is assumed to remain available for reservoir releases to at least elevation of 525 feet, below which some air entrainment may be seen as a vortex at the reservoir surface. Remove the log boom as required. Operate for flood control until the surface diversion channel is completed at Elwha Dam.   b. Excavate the earthfill embankment on the left abutment (having an estimated volume of 2,400 yd 3 ) to provide materials for construction of a crane pad (requiring about 150 yd 3 ) and contractor use area on the left abutment above elevation of 600 feet. Embankment materials in excess of those required at the site would be removed.   c. Erect a ringer crane with a 300-foot boom on the left abutment crane pad. Deliver any necessary demolition equipment and materials to the dam. While reservoir releases are limited to the power penstock, drill and blast the concrete apron at the toe of the dam for later removal. An estimated 500 yd 3  of concrete rubble will result from the blasting. The rubble will provide sufficient protection for the dam foundation during future diversions over the dam crest.   d. Following completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, begin demolition of the arch dam section in 7.5-foot-high layers (as shown in Drawing 1440-D-155) using diamond-wire sawcutting methods. Make horizontal cuts every 7.5 feet by sawcutting between the thrust block and pier 1 of the gated spillway. Make transverse (upstream-downstream) vertical cuts by sawcutting within reinforced areas of the dam, or by drilling closely-spaced blast holes for pre-splitting unreinforced concrete. Steel reinforcement will be encountered throughout layer No. 1 (elevations of 590.33 to 582.83 feet) and in portions of layers 2 through 7 (elevations of 582.83 to 537.83 feet) near the abutments. Sawcutting rates should average about 7.5 ft 2  per hour, with a continuous operation assumed for each single cut. The horizontal sawcuts will determine the required duration for removal of each layer. Vertical sawcuts will establish smooth surfaces at the thrust block and spillway pier 1 to be retained.   e. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete from layers 1 through 7 into large blocks up to the safe crane capacity for the block location, and within the allowable load limits for hauling from the damsite in trucks. Typical blocks will weigh about 35 tons, with a volume of up to 18 yd 3  each. For the 7.5-foot-high blocks, typical widths and lengths will average 8 feet; however, concrete blocks within reinforced areas of the dam will range up to 14 feet long, since no longitudinal (cross-canyon) saw cuts can be made. One longitudinal, pre-split cut may be made within unreinforced portions of layers 5 through 7. Excavation rates should result in the removal of an average of two concrete blocks (or 36 yd 3 ) per day. The ladder well walls may be excavated with the blocks, or by themselves in advance of the dam removal.   f. Remove any concrete remaining on the bedrock abutments following block removal using a hoe-ram or other methods. Some grouted rock bolts may be required to be installed on the abutments to ensure stability of the remaining rock mass. The cost estimate includes nominal quantities for concrete demolition on abutment contacts (100 yd 3 ) and for 1-inch-diameter grouted rock bolts (ten 20-foot-long bolts).         Stage Two — Diversion Through Notches, Remove Layers 8-12  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Notches are to be excavated below Layer 7 at 7.5-foot intervals (alternating from left to right abutment) to provide 16 overflow sills between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet for streamflow diversion. Flood flows exceeding the capacity of the notches will overtop the remaining portions of the excavated dam crest, requiring a temporary work shutdown. The notches will be excavated below reservoir levels in stages to depths of 15 feet, to permit as much demolition work as possible to be performed in the dry. Lines of 2-inch-diameter, pre-split holes on 1.5-foot centers were assumed for estimating purposes to be drilled along the inside end of each notch (nearest the ladder well) and about 3 feet inside the upstream face of the dam (near the abutment) to set the limits for production blasting. Production blasts (using 2-inch holes on 4-foot centers for estimating purposes) will be controlled and confined by mats or nets for removal of the resulting concrete rubble from the dam crest, rather than from the river channel below. Breaching of the notches will be performed by blasting the remaining upstream face in segments to control reservoir release rates. The resulting rubble would be washed downstream. Excavation of a typical notch having a bottom width of 25 feet may be performed in four segments at 1-hour intervals to limit the rate of increase in reservoir outflow to about 1,000 cfs per hour. (This would be similar to the maximum hourly rate of increase experienced during passage of the 5-year flood.) Each notch would be designed to lower the reservoir (within 1 or 2 days) to a level required for excavation of the next layer. A 25-foot width would have a discharge capacity of about 1,400 cfs with a 7.5-foot head. Actual notch widths may be dependent upon site conditions, projected inflows, and sediment management objectives. A new notch can be established about every 8 to 16 days, assuming no flood delays.   b. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete in layers 8 through 12 as notch sills 1 through 5 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Layer 8 will require a horizontal sawcut at elevation of 530.33 feet from the right abutment to the first notch. Layers 9 through 12 will require horizontal sawcuts between the notches on both abutments. The removal plan assumes one longitudinal pre-split for layers 8 through 10, and two longitudinal pre-splits for layers 11 and 12, with transverse pre-splits as required to produce suitable block sizes for removal by the ringer crane.   c. Upon completion of notch sill 5 to elevation of 492.83 feet, the penstock guard gate can be closed and demolition work can begin on the intake tower and the surge tank. The intake tower and trashracks are to be removed, and a concrete plug is to be constructed at the upstream tunnel portal. The surge tank is also to be removed, with a concrete plug placed around the penstock at the downstream tunnel portal, and a steel plate added to the top of the penstock at the opening for the tee connection. A concrete cap may also be required at the gate shaft.   d. Sediment releases will occur with the blasting of notches in the dam. A winter shutdown to minimize impacts to anadromous fish is assumed in the construction schedule for the 1-month period November 15 to December 15.         Stage Three — Diversion Through Notches, Remove Layers 13-21  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete in layers 13 through 17 as notch sills 6 through 10 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Layers 13 through 17 will require horizontal sawcuts between the notches on both abutments. The removal plan assumes two longitudinal pre-splits for layers 13 through 17, with transverse pre-splits as required to produce suitable block sizes for removal by the ringer crane.   b. Reservoir sediments are expected to be encountered at the upstream face of the dam for removal of layers 18 through 23. No horizontal sawcutting is assumed below elevation of 462.83 feet. Drill holes were assumed to be located on 4-foot centers for production blasting of the concrete in layers, with blasting mats used to confine the concrete rubble to the dam crest for removal using the ringer crane and a skip. Layers 18 through 21 will be blasted as notch sills 11 through 14 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered.   c. Remove low-level sluiceway trashrack, butterfly valve, and valve operator during demolition of layers 19 and 20. The concrete encasement will be blasted, and the metalwork will be lifted out by the ringer crane for disposal.   d. A summer shutdown to minimize impacts to anadromous fish is assumed in the construction schedule for the 2-month period May 1 to June 30.         Stage Four — Remove Final Layers and Base of Dam  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Excavation of the final two layers (22 and 23), excavation of the base of the dam to an elevation of 400 feet, and final channel cleanup (including removal of any concrete rubble, boulders, and the tailrace training wall) must be performed during the low-flow period (August through October).   b. Drill holes were assumed to be located on 4-foot centers for production blasting of the concrete in layers 22 and 23, with blasting mats used to confine the concrete rubble to the dam crest for removal using the ringer crane and a skip. Layers 22 and 23 will be blasted as notch sills 15 and 16 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Notch sill 16 will be considerably narrower than the other notches, due to the physical dimensions of the canyon near the base of the dam.   c. Vertical and angled drill holes will be required from an elevation of 417.83 feet for production blasting of the base of the dam to the final excavation level (elevation of 400 feet). Angled holes are required for excavation of the sloping downstream face of the arch dam at that elevation, and to remove the concrete below notch sill 16 at elevation of 410.33 feet.   d. Remove as much concrete rubble as practical from the river channel during the low-flow period, including the rubble from all notch excavations in addition to the rubble from the base of the dam. Also remove the tailrace training wall at the powerhouse.   e. Final site cleanup will include removal of the transformer yard equipment, metal shed, and fencing, and shaping and seeding of the construction areas as necessary.         5. Waste disposal  — All waste materials will be removed from the site. Suitable sites within 20 miles of Glines Canyon Dam for disposal of waste concrete and material (dirt, rocks, etc.) are being investigated. The cost estimate assumes waste concrete will be dumped at an approved disposal site without further handling. About 7,000 yd 3  of concrete will be in large blocks, weighing between 26 and 35 tons each. Additional costs to crush all waste concrete to an average 1½-inch size for disposal (with any reinforcing steel removed) may range from about $7 to $14 per cubic yard or more, depending upon the initial size of the waste concrete. If such crushing is found to be necessary, the estimated costs for removal of Glines Canyon Dam could increase by more than $200,000.   Preliminary investigations were made into the potential use of the concrete blocks and rubble for beneficial uses, including shoreline protection and off-shore reefs. Initial indications were for a predominant size of 1 meter (3.3 feet), with a maximum size up to 2 meters (6.6 feet). Further investigations of potential beneficial uses of waste concrete will be made during final design.   The steel trashracks, surge tank, and butterfly valve would probably be salvaged for recycling. Hazardous materials would be sent to an approved disposal site. Other items to be removed would be salvaged for historical or commercial value, or buried in a landfill.   6. Structure retention  — Several structures are proposed to be retained at the site for their historical value and opportunities for interpretation. Retention of the following structures would not place any limitations on restoration of the ecosystem and anadromous fisheries, and could result in a significant cost savings to the project. Each structure retained would require some modifications to minimize future maintenance and/or provide for visitor safety.   Retention of the right abutment thrust block, gravity section, and earthfill embankment (with log flume) would provide an excellent public overlook at the Glines Canyon site accessible from Whiskey Bend Road, and would eliminate the need for contractor access (and disturbance) on the right abutment of the dam. The existing guardrails would be modified by the addition of wire mesh to improve visitor safety, and some additional fencing and signs may be required around the site. An estimated savings of about $500,000 could be realized by the retention of these features.   Retention of the gated spillway structure would provide significant historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities, while providing a public overlook on the left abutment of the dam accessible from the Olympic Hot Springs Road. Long-term maintenance costs would be minimal; however, some modifications would be necessary to provide for visitor safety, such as improved guardrails (addition of wire mesh), permanent covers for the openings in the hoist deck, and measures to prevent visitors from reaching the spillway chutes. The gated spillway could be retained at an estimated savings of about $500,000.   The powerhouse would be retained as an excellent example of early hydropower generation technology. Exhibits could be located on the main floor to describe the various pieces of equipment and how water was used to generate electricity. The large glass windows would be replaced or protected to prevent vandalism, and any hazardous materials would be removed or confined (i.e., asbestos insulation). The roof would be repaired if necessary. A estimated savings of about $1 million could be realized by retention of the powerhouse and equipment.   The steel penstock between the tunnel portal and the powerhouse also offers significant historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities. To be included in an interpretive trail, the wooden stairway on top of the penstock would be replaced by a low maintenance, metal stairway with guardrails, and the stairway and penstock would be painted. The penstock opening at the surge tank location would be permanently sealed with a steel cover plate, and the tunnel portal would be sealed with a concrete plug to prevent visitor access. A estimated savings of about $200,000 could be realized by retention of the penstock.   Retention of the gatehouse, shaft, and footbridge is currently being considered for potential historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities. If retained, the glass windows and door would be removed to prevent vandalism, and the wooden stairway would be replaced with a low maintenance, metal stairway. The guardrails would be modified with wire mesh for improved public safety. All exposed electrical wiring and the wooden power pole would be removed, and openings in the gatehouse floor and at the top of the shaft would be sealed. A modest savings of about $30,000 could be realized by retaining these features.   The two wood-frame residences and the maintenance shed on the left abutment would provide needed office and storage space at the site during the demolition work, and would be retained at least for the duration of the contract. The NPS may decide to retain these structures for ecosystem restoration researchers. A modest savings of about$20,000 could be realized by retaining the structures.   7. Site restoration  — A site restoration plan will be developed for the left abutment to provide natural-looking contours following removal of the earthfill embankment and the crane pad. The river channel between the damsite and the powerhouse contains large boulders and woody debris which will be removed as necessary for fish passage and potential recreational use of the river, if possible. Fencing, guardrails, and warning signs are anticipated to be required around remaining structures on both abutments for public safety. Permanent electric power will be provided to the site for the structures and exterior lighting. Improvements to the Olympic Hot Springs Road are described in Chapter VIII, Section C.               Figure 12. — Glines Canyon Dam, Discharge Curves for 25-Foot-Wide Notches   Available only in 2nd generation hard copy           CHAPTER VIII. ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS    A. HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL    Hazardous materials identified at the dam sites include asbestos siding and floor tiles in the maintenance shop building at Elwha Dam, asbestos insulation for wiring in both powerhouses, banks of lead-acid batteries in both powerhouses, small quantities of hazardous chemicals, and possible contaminated oil and soils at both sites. Asbestos may also be found in duct insulation, valve or turbine packing, piping or turbine gaskets, and generator brake shoes. Lubricating oils and grease should be removed from mechanical equipment and properly disposed of as one of the first steps of decommissioning. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may also be present in small quantities at both sites. The Service has prepared a separate report on the proposed collection and disposal of hazardous waste, with an estimated cost to the project of $1.2 million.   Of additional concern is the potential for lead-based paint to have been used for steel coatings at both sites, including penstocks, surge tanks, slide gates, Tainter gates, trashracks, and any painted equipment. Although not currently classified as a hazardous material by the Interior Department, all lead-based paint (if shown to exist) would have to be removed from steel items proposed for recycling. Estimated costs for removal and disposal of lead-based paint could exceed $200,000 if such action is found to be required.         B. REMOVAL OF TRANSMISSION LINES    Existing 69 kV, three-phase transmission lines extend approximately 7 miles from Glines Canyon Dam to Elwha Dam (Line No. 3), approximately 6 miles from Elwha Dam to the Daishowa-America paper mill in Port Angeles, Washington (Line No. 1), and approximately 8 miles from Elwha Dam to the Bonneville Power Administration–City of Port Angeles substation (Line No. 2). Previous estimates included the removal of 14 miles of transmission lines and poles at a cost of $238,000 plus contingencies (1990 dollars). Additional studies are being performed to determine the current project requirements and associated costs for this work.         C. ROAD IMPROVEMENT PLAN    Heavy construction traffic associated with hauling waste materials from both dam sites to designated disposal areas may cause damage to some of the existing roadways in the area. The Dam Removal Task Group was requested to determine the extent of road damage that may occur and appropriate methods of repair.   Primary access to Elwha Dam is along U.S. Highway 101 to State Highway 112. From Highway 112, Elwha Dam is located about one-half mile south on the Lower Elwha Dam Road. The two highways are designed and constructed to accept standard truck traffic. The Lower Dam Road consists of an improved gravel surface, and is almost entirely located on Elwha Dam project lands.   Primary access to Glines Canyon Dam is along U.S. Highway 101 from the east or west, and then south along Olympic Hot Springs Road for about 4.5 miles to the dam. U.S. 101 has been designed and constructed to accept standard truck traffic, including roadway surfaces and bridges.   The Olympic Hot Springs Road has only a bituminous surface treatment (BST), consisting of two coats of a chip material placed over liquid asphalt. The road base of this section of road consists of a thin layer of gravel. The subgrade contains a high percentage of clay. Approximately 3.5 miles of the road to the dam is within Olympic National Park and maintained by the NPS. The initial mile of this road off of U.S. 101 is maintained by Clallam County. The Altaire Bridge has been designed for ""HS 20"" loads and will easily accommodate construction traffic.   The dam removal contractor will be using conventional hauling equipment for removing the waste and salvage materials from the dam sites and transporting them to disposal areas. Based on the current information available on the location of potential disposal sites, the majority of travel will be along the two highways, except for 4.5 miles along the Olympic Hot Springs Road, and 0.5 miles along the Lower Elwha Dam Road. Truck traffic for removal of Glines Canyon Dam may involve up to 3 trips per day over the two-year construction period. Hauling would be performed 5 or 6 days per week during daylight hours along the Olympic Hot Springs Road. Truck traffic for removal of Elwha Dam may involve hauling as many as 8 loads per hour for two 10-hour shifts during the second year. In both cases, the loads would not exceed 80,000 pounds. Typical construction equipment used for hauling would include flat beds, low boys, and dump trucks. The dam removal contractor will be required to make appropriate repairs to the Lower Elwha Dam Road and the Olympic Hot Springs Road to allow for normal use during the two years of construction.   The probable type of equipment to be used for hauling materials, the expected weight of the individual loads, the number of loads, and the condition of the existing roads were the criteria considered for determining the final repairs that may be required following completion of construction activities for dam removal. This analysis indicated the existing state and major county roads are currently adequate to withstand the expected truck traffic. According to the Clallam County Road Department, Olympic Hot Springs Road from U.S. 101 to Glines Canyon Dam was not designed to carry a significant number of heavy truck loads. The clay subgrade becomes very soft and deformable when wet. These conditions will not hold up very well to the volume and weight of the truck traffic during the construction period, and may produce a non-uniform surface grade containing dips and ruts. While the dam removal contractor will be required to make any necessary repairs during construction to accommodate his activities and local traffic, major repairs will be needed following construction.   Two types of roadway repairs were considered. They consisted of either spot patching with resurfacing, and total replacement. The alternative for spot patching, as needed, is difficult to evaluate due to the inability to identify with any confidence the extent of potential damage and the amount of patching that may be required. It is anticipated that dips and ruts will be typical repair requirements, which could involve long sections of the road. The spot patching alternative would include resurfacing of the entire roadway with two layers of bituminous surface treatment. Total replacement includes the removal of the existing roadway surface by pulverization.   The pulverized material would be spread over the subgrade during the regrading process, and compacted in place. Two layers of bituminous surface treatment would be placed over the subgrade, similar to the spot patching alternative. This treatment matches the current roadway surface, and is considered adequate for the normal future traffic expected along this road. The existing roadway has functioned very well under similar traffic patterns.   The total replacement alternative ensures that all potential deficiencies are addressed, and is recommended. The roadway improvements would be performed during the first road construction season following completion of the dam removal activities. Replacement of the entire stretch of road from U.S. 101 to Glines Canyon Dam would take approximately one month. A cost estimate for replacing the entire roadway was prepared by Reclamation’s Technical Service Center. The estimated field cost for performing the work described for this alternative is $480,000. A copy of the construction cost estimate is included in Appendix E.   The Corps (1987) determined that portions of the Olympic Hot Springs Road must be raised for flood protection due to higher stages of the Elwha River. Approximately 1 mile of road within the park may be raised 1.5 feet, and approximately 0.7 mile of road outside the park may be raised by 1.5 to 2.5 feet. These requirements are discussed further in the 1987 Corps report on flood control measures.   The quantity and source of materials required to raise the Olympic Hot Springs Road will be investigated further during final design. Excavation materials from the removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams my be considered to meet this requirement, which could exceed 10,000 yd 3 .           CHAPTER IX. PROJECT SCHEDULE AND ESTIMATED COSTS    A. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR PERFORMING WORK    Basic assumptions were made for performing the demolition work at both dam sites, as follows.   Elwha Dam    1. The powerplant is decommissioned and all hazardous materials are removed from the site by others prior to award of the demolition contract. The turbine runners are removed from the vertical units (3 and 4) to increase the discharge capacity of the 15-foot-diameter penstock and ensure continuous release capability under all operating conditions as required for streamflow diversion.   2. The Eicher fish screen, fish rearing pens, and associated equipment and materials (including the derrick crane) are removed from the site by the owners (EPRI) prior to contract award.  [Note: In the period since these assumptions were formed, it appears the majority of the materials will be left on site. However, the additional cost to remove them is not considered to be a significant addition to the total budget, and the cost estimates in Appendix E have not been changed.]  3. All structures at the site are to be demolished. Burial of some concrete rubble and reinforcing steel will be permitted at the site to minimize project costs.   4. A suitable land disposal site is located within 10 miles of the damsite for excess waste materials (earth and concrete rubble). Waste materials are dumped at the disposal sites without further compaction or reduction in size.   5. Glines Canyon Dam will be retained to provide some flood protection until the left abutment surface diversion channel can be established.   6. Threatened and Endangered species or other environmental concerns which would affect or limit construction activities are not identified. However, to minimize impacts to anadromous fish runs, no construction activities which would introduce additional reservoir sediments to the Elwha River will be performed during the 1-month period from November 15 to December 15 and the 2-month period from May 1 to June 30.   7. Construction and operation of a slurry pipeline at the site would not have a net adverse impact on the demolition activities.         Glines Canyon Dam    1. The powerplant is decommissioned and specific hazardous materials are removed from the site as required prior to award of the demolition contract. The turbine runner is removed to increase the discharge capacity of the power penstock and ensure continuous release capability under all operating conditions as required for streamflow diversion.   2. The dam will be operated for flood control until the diversion channel is completed at Elwha Dam.   3. Only the concrete arch portion of the dam, the intake tower, surge tank, transformer yard, tailrace training wall, log boom, earthfill embankment on the left abutment, boat house, and transmission lines are required to be removed. Other structures at the site on both abutments are to be retained for interpretive purposes and historic mitigation. All waste materials are to be removed from the site.   4. A suitable land disposal site is located within 20 miles of the damsite for waste materials (earth and concrete rubble). Waste materials are dumped at the disposal sites without further compaction or reduction in size.   5. Threatened and Endangered species, or other environmental concerns, are not identified which would affect or limit construction activities, except that no construction activities which would introduce additional reservoir sediments to the Elwha River will be performed during the 1-month period from November 15 to December 15, and during the 2-month period from May 1 to June 30. Sawcutting operations at the dam are assumed to continue around-the-clock for each layer as required.   6. Construction and operation of a slurry pipeline at the site would not have a net adverse impact on the demolition activities.   7. Final improvements required by the NPS for use of the area by the public (such as road repaving, permanent powerlines, interpretation centers and displays) will be included under separate completion contracts.         B. DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTRUCTION LOGIC AND DURATIONS    Construction schedules for removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams were prepared using the software Primavera Project Planner, developed by Primavera Systems, Inc., and are included in Appendix D. Construction activities and sequences were identified using the proposed dam removal plans described in Chapter VIII and the basic assumptions listed above. Activity durations were based on engineering judgement and experience, and were modified as necessary for high flows (based on average streamflow conditions and available discharge capacity). Key assumptions for establishing activity durations include an average diamond-wire sawcutting rate of 180 ft 2  per day for concrete in the arch at Glines Canyon Dam, and an average excavation rate of 1,000 yd 3  per day for the channel fill materials at Elwha Dam. Proposed reservoir drawdown rates for Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell are also important factors affecting slope stability, sediment management, and public safety. Early and late start dates and finish dates were established for all activities based on the assumed durations and sequences. A critical path was identified for activities which could not slip without affecting the overall completion date.   Various contract start dates were assumed and the corresponding schedule impacts were evaluated on a seasonal basis to determine the optimum start date of November 1. Excavation of the diversion channel plug at Elwha Dam, and final excavation within the river channel at Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, are scheduled for the historic low flow period (August through October) of the first and second year. Planned work stoppage periods are assumed for November 15 to December 15 and for May 1 to June 30 of each year for those activities which would release reservoir sediments to the Elwha River. These periods correspond to historic high flow periods, and are intended to minimize potential adverse impacts to anadromous fish runs (chum in winter and steelhead in summer). All work under the demolition contract should be completed within approximately two years.         C. EFFECTS ON SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT AND WATER QUALITY    Sediment routing models for the Elwha River were developed by the Sediment Management Task Group (Reclamation, March 1996a), based on the current proposed construction schedules for dam removal. The rates of reservoir drawdown resulting from the proposed dam removal plans appear to be compatible with the sediment management objectives, particularly the notching rate at Glines Canyon Dam for lowering Lake Mills. These results were used in  Report of the Water Quality Task Group  (Reclamation, in publication) to confirm the water treatment requirements. See the reports of both task groups for further details.         D. COST ESTIMATES FOR DAM REMOVAL    1. Field costs  — Construction cost estimates have been prepared to a feasibility level for the removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, and related appurtenant structures as required, and are included in Appendix E. These estimates of field costs are based on computed quantities and on unit prices developed at an April 1995 price level. The cost estimates include contractor mobilization, streamflow diversion provisions, and dam and associated structure removal and disposal, with an unlisted item allowance of 5 percent and an allowance of 20 percent for contract contingencies (unforeseen costs or conditions). The methods assumed for streamflow diversion and structure demolition are detailed in Chapter VII. Cost estimates do not include costs for hazardous waste removal and disposal, powerplant decommissioning, and removal of transmission lines, which have been estimated by others. A project acquisition cost of $29.5 million was previously established by Public Law 102-495.   The estimated field cost for removal and disposal of Elwha Dam and all appurtenant structures is $10.5 million. The estimated field cost for removal and disposal of the arch dam, intake tower, surge tank, left abutment dike, and transformer yard at Glines Canyon Dam is $9.7 million. The total estimated field cost for removal of both dams is therefore $20.2 million. Assuming a two-year construction period beginning in November of the first year, expenditures for dam removal are estimated to range from 36–53 percent the first fiscal year, 47-59 percent the second, and 0–5 percent the third, based on cost-loading the early and late construction schedules discussed in Section B above.   The estimated field cost for removal of both dams is $3.17 million (about 20 percent) higher than the total cost identified in  The Elwha Report , and does not include costs for final design and construction management. This discrepancy is due to larger quantities and/or higher unit prices for many of the individual items of work. For example, the channel fill excavation quantity at Elwha Dam is currently estimated at about 200,000 yd 3 , which is much greater than the 80,000 yd 3  estimate included in  The Elwha Report  (although comparable to the 223,000 yd 3  estimate included in the  Draft Staff Report ). Combined with higher unit prices for excavation and disposal, the cost of removal of the channel fill alone is $1.2 million higher in the current estimate. The estimated cost for removal of the steel penstocks and surge tank at Elwha Dam is nearly $900,000 higher, and the estimated cost of removal of the powerplant equipment is nearly $500,000 higher. Unit prices for excavation and disposal of reinforced concrete structures range from about $160 to $210 in the current estimate, compared to $50 to $75 for  The Elwha Report , increasing total estimated costs by about $1 million. The largest single difference between the two estimates is in the cost of excavation and disposal of the arch dam section at Glines Canyon Dam. The current estimate determined costs for sawcutting, controlled blasting, and hauling of the concrete arch in layers to be about $5.4 million (for 15,200 yd 3 ), compared to about $900,000 (for 11,850 yd 3 ). Some project savings are realized by the retention of selected structures at Glines Canyon Dam (about $2.25 million; see Chapter VII, section B.6). Costs for final design and construction management are discussed below.   2. Design costs  — The total estimated cost for Reclamation’s Technical Service Center to prepare final designs and specifications is $710,500, based on an estimate of 1,155 staff-days and on estimated non-labor costs of $17,500. This represents an engineering design cost of 3.4 percent of the contract cost. Additional costs will be incurred by Reclamation’s Pacific Northwest Regional Office for the collection and preparation of design data.   3. Construction management costs  — Construction management costs for maintenance of a field office for inspection services, and for contract administration and design support during the demolition work, are estimated to represent 15 percent of the contract cost, about $3,150,000. This includes an estimate of 496 staff-days and a total cost of $312,600 for Reclamation’s Technical Service Center for design support, 1.5 percent of the contract cost.        CHAPTER X. CONCLUSIONS          Feasibility-level designs and estimates have been prepared for the removal and/or burial of all structures at Elwha Dam, and for the removal of the arch dam section, intake structure, surge tank, left abutment dike, boathouse, and transformer yard at Glines Canyon Dam. The current studies confirm that dam removal is technically feasible at both sites, and can be safely performed in a manner compatible with sediment management requirements and project objectives. Dam removal activities will require a period of approximately two years to complete, for an estimated total field cost of $20.2 million, including an allowance of 20 percent for contingencies. Design and construction management costs for dam removal would add about 20 percent, or approximately $4 million to the total estimated cost.   Under the proposed dam removal plans, both powerplants would be decommissioned prior to award of the demolition contract, and the turbine runners would be removed from the vertical units at both sites for improved streamflow diversion capacity. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control until a surface diversion channel is established at Elwha Dam, at which time demolition of both dams would commence.   The removal of Elwha Dam requires the demolition of about 30,000 yd 3  of concrete in the gravity section and appurtenant structures, and the disposal of about 2,500,000 lbs of mechanical and electrical items in the spillways, powerplant, penstocks, and surge tank. An estimated 200,000 yd 3  of sand, gravel, and rockfill must be removed from the channel forebay area to restore the river to its original course. Concrete demolition and diversion channel excavation will be performed by drill-and-blast methods, with much of the concrete and some rockfill remaining on site to provide the final site contours. Waste concrete and channel fill materials in excess of the quantities required at the site will be hauled to a disposal site within 10 miles of the damsite. Mechanical and electrical items will be salvaged for recycling, or disposed of in a landfill. Additional estimated costs for disposal of materials would be incurred if concrete crushing is required (over $100,000) and if lead-based paint must be removed (over $200,000).   The removal of Glines Canyon Dam requires the demolition of about 16,000 yd 3  of concrete in the arch dam and intake structure, and the disposal of about 200,000 lbs of mechanical and electrical items in the sluiceway, transformer yard, and surge tank. Concrete demolition will be performed by a combination of diamond-wire sawcutting and drill-and-blast methods, with all waste materials removed from the site. Waste concrete and earthfill materials will be hauled to a disposal site within 20 miles of the damsite. Mechanical and electrical items will be salvaged for recycling, or disposed of in a landfill. Additional estimated costs for disposal of materials would be incurred if concrete crushing is required (over $200,000).           CHAPTER XI. RECOMMENDATIONS          A. CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION    Negotiated procurement is recommended for future contracting of the demolition work, by which proposals would be solicited for selection based on both cost and technical merit. Negotiated procurement is a more flexible approach to contracting than the sealed bidding process, and is used when alternative, innovative approaches to construction are desired. This process allows confidential discussions (negotiations) with offerors within a competitive range of acceptable proposals, prior to best and final offers. Final selection of a proposal is based both on cost and on technical factors (including proposed construction methods, corporate experience, personnel qualifications, and project compliance) using established evaluation criteria. This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan for the lowest overall cost.         B. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR FINAL DESIGNS    Additional information will be required prior to initiating final designs. This information will be used to refine and evaluate some of the feasibility design assumptions, and to develop designs for features that were not included in the feasibility design. The following items are required to address specific issues at each dam.   Elwha Dam    1. The proposed access to the left abutment of Elwha Dam requires the use of barges or float bridges. An existing trail that passes through public and private lands could be developed into an access road, which would greatly simplify many activities. The feasibility and costs for developing this access should be investigated.   2. The characteristics and volume of the fill material in the forebay area have largely been developed from previous reports. Due to the large volume of this material, and the significant portion of the overall dam removal costs for removing this material, it is important to have a better understanding of the composition of the material to avoid costly surprises during the demolition process. A suitable method of sampling this material at depth needs to be developed for at least two locations within the forebay area.   3. A significant savings could be achieved by allowing up to 50,000 yd 3  of sands and gravel to be eroded naturally by the river during the final stages of excavating the upstream fill materials. An evaluation needs to be made regarding the ability of the river to transport the materials during specified time periods. This volume is small compared to the sediment volumes proposed to be eroded from the upstream reservoirs.   4. The potential exists for seepage to occur through the diversion channel fill material above an elevation of 135 feet for extremely high flows following construction activities. The suitability of fill material along with concrete rubble should be investigated to determine if seepage could be allowed with proper gradation (without experiencing a piping failure), or whether a concrete cutoff wall should be provided within the fill.   5. Some information has already been obtained regarding the bedrock contour along the proposed diversion channel alignment. Since the proposed alignment is dependent on the bedrock elevations, it is important to substantiate the estimated bedrock contours. Seismic-refraction surveys and additional drill holes are proposed to develop this information.   Glines Canyon Dam    1. Geologic mapping of the canyon walls immediately downstream of the dam should be performed. This information would provide a better assessment for the need for rock bolts to ensure long-term stability following dam removal.   2. The retention of several features at Glines Canyon Dam will require more detailed designs for modifications that will result in minimal maintenance and vandalism, and provide for public safety.   General    Several additional activities need to be performed that are common to both dams.   1. Concrete coring and non-destructive testing needs to be performed to determine the relative strength of the concrete. This information is important for perspective contractors for evaluating various demolition alternatives.   2. While much information has already been obtained, additional data and drawings of the existing structures for both dams will be investigated during final design. Revised area and capacity curves will be developed using the latest survey data.   3. Studies have been performed by representatives of the Tribe for locating potential disposal sites that may be available for accepting the various kinds and volume of materials coming from the demolition activities. A list of disposal sites will need to be confirmed during final designs. Potential use of excavated materials to raise the Olympic Hot Springs Road, and recycling opportunities, should also be investigated.   4. The feasibility designs assumed that construction power would be provided by engine generators. The feasibility of using conventional power should be investigated, including an economic comparison of the two alternatives.   5. The impacts of construction activities on Threatened and Endangered species need to be reevaluated during final designs.           REFERENCES   Casagrande, Arthur. September 1961.

The Federal Government, through the Minerals Management Service, issues permits for prelease exploration activities, evaluates resources, leases acreage, and regulates drilling and production activities. This publication provides information about how these oil and gas resources are effectively evaluated. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, passed by Congress in 1953 and amended in 1978, is the basis for the procedures and activities to be discussed here. This publication describes the procedures followed in evaluating offshore resources, beginning with the permitting and collecting of geological and geophysical data and ending with the resource economic and engineering evaluations and analyses for a lease sale. It is a summary of the Minerals Management Service oil and gas Resource Evaluation Program on the Outer Continental Shelf, the results of which are intended to assure the Government receipt of fair market value for these lands. We hope this publication will provide you with a better understanding of the evaluation of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.  iii   Contents Preface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Acronyms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Technical and Historical Background . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 OCS Leasing Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 RE Program Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Regulation of G&G Data Collection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 G&G Data Acquisition and Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Resource Assessment and Estimation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 Tract Evaluation/Fair Market Value Determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 Reserve Inventory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 Technical Information Distribution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 Glossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Appendix A: Resource Estimation Methodology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 Appendix B: Fair Market Guidelines . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36 Appendix C: MONTCAR Methodology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42   Figures 1.

In response to public concerns about the ownership and development of offshore resources, Congress, in 1953, enacted two laws that granted certain offshore lands to coastal States and provided a framework for regulating and managing exploration, development, and production of resources under the seabed beyond the area managed by the coastal States. The two acts are as follows: The Submerged Lands Act. The Submerged Lands Act of May 22, 1953, granted the coastal States a belt of submerged lands seaward of their coastlines to a distance of 3 geographical miles. A greater distance from shore (about 3 marine leagues) was granted to Texas and Florida (west coast only), because these States had established jurisdiction over the larger area before achieving statehood. As a result of this Act, natural resources of the seabed beyond those granted to coastal States would be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act and its Amendments. The OCS Lands Act of August 7, 1953 (1) reaffirmed that those lands beyond the 3 geographical mile limit, or more, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Government and (2) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to grant mineral leases on OCS lands and to provide regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act. The Act was amended on September 18, 1978. The amendments established a policy for managing oil and gas on the OCS and required revision of bidding systems and lease administration, coordination, and consultation with affected State and local governments, development of environmental studies for lease sale areas, and development of a 5-year leasing program. In addition, with regard to resource evaluation, the Secretary is required to assure the receipt of fair market value (FMV) for OCS lands in oil and gas leasing. Other Laws that Govern the OCS. Resource evaluation of the OCS is also subject to the requirements of other Federal laws administered by numerous Federal Departments and Agencies. Among them is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, which establishes requirements for preparation of environmental assessments and environmental impact statements for major Federal actions that could affect significantly the quality of the human environment. Included in the environmental impact statements are resource estimates and exploration, development, and production scenarios for oil and gas resources.  Regulatory Authority for the Resource Evaluation Program Regulations. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers the provisions of the OCS Lands Act, as amended, through regulations found in Title 30 of the Code of   Federal Regulations (CFR). The regulations govern leasing, permitting, collecting of data, and operations on the OCS. With regard to the Resource Evaluation Program, authority has been vested in the Secretary of the Interior under 30 CFR Part 251 to regulate the conduct of prelease geological and geophysical (G&G) exploration for mineral resources on the OCS. Part 251 applies not only to G&G exploration but to scientific research as well. The purpose of these regulations is (1) to prescribe when a permit or the filing of a statement of intent to conduct G&G exploration on the OCS is required and (2) to prescribe operating procedures for conducting exploration, requirements for disclosing data and information, conditions for reimbursing permittees for certain costs, and other conditions under which exploration shall be conducted. Similar regulations addressing prelease prospecting activities can be found in 30 CFR Part 280.  Technical and Historical Background Outer Continental Shelf The term ""continental shelf"" is distinct from the term ""Outer Continental Shelf"", which is a legal term created by Federal statute. There is no scientific definition for the OCS. Legally, the OCS comprises that part of the continental margin adjacent to the United States that remained subject to Federal jurisdiction and control after enactment of the Submerged Lands Act. Under the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, the seaward limit of the shelf is defined as "". . . a depth of 200 meters (656 feet) or, beyond that limit to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas."" The submerged seaward extension of a continent is called the continental margin. In most areas, this submerged extension is composed of the gently sloping continental shelf and the steeper gradients of the continental slope. In some areas, an apron of material derived from the continent--the continental rise--extends from the base of the continental slope to the abyssal ocean floor. Figure 1 shows a generalized profile of the continental margin. The contour and extent of the continental shelf vary from one coastal area to another. The shelf is relatively narrow along the Pacific coast, moderately wide along much of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Alaska, and broad in the Gulf of Mexico and around western and northwestern Alaska. It is generally defined as a gently sloping submerged marginal zone of the continents extending from the shore outward through shallow waters to a dropoff at the continental slope in deeper waters. Evaluation of oil and gas resources on the Federal OCS currently involves the submerged lands generally 3 geographic miles seaward from a State's coast line to about 200 to 300 nautical miles offshore.  2   Exclusive Economic Zone On March 10, 1983, a Presidential Proclamation established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States of America. The EEZ extends seaward 200 nautical miles from the ""baseline"" (the legal coastline) of the territorial sea of the United States, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana Islands, and other U.S. overseas territories and possessions. The EEZ covers over 3 billion acres subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Within the EEZ, the United States has sovereign rights, to the extent permitted by international law, to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage natural resources, both living and nonliving, of the seabed and subsoil. The Federal Government is authorized by the OCS Lands Act to manage the leasing of all minerals including oil and gas within the EEZ off the 50 States. Figure 2 shows the location of the EEZ.

Profile of the continental margin  3   Figure 2. Exclusive Economic Zone  Petroleum Geology The Resource Evaluation Program addresses the mineral potential of the OCS, predominantly oil and gas, i.e., petroleum. Petroleum is found beneath the surface of the Earth both onshore and on the continental shelf and slope. The key geologic requirements are (1) source rocks -- organic-rich sediments that serve as a source of hydrocarbons, (2) reservoir rocks -- porous and permeable rocks where the hydrocarbons can accumulate, (3) an impermeable capping rock or porosity barrier that serves as a trapping mechanism and prevents the hydrocarbons from escaping, and (4) a favorable thermal history to transform the organics into hydrocarbons. Most scientists believe that the majority of hydrocarbons are associated with rocks that were formed or deposited in a marine environment millions of years ago. Great volumes of organic and inorganic matter accumulated in these marine environments, and, as this material continued to accumulate, pressure was applied from the weight of the overlying sedimentary pile. This pressure, together with the heat of the Earth, probably produced oil and gas from the organic matter. Scientists have proven that organic matter may be transformed into oil and gas by long periods of continuous heat and pressure aided by bacterial action. Gradually, over millions of years, some of the oil and gas migrated into porous and permeable rocks.  4   Oil is not a homogeneous compound. Two primary elements -- hydrogen and carbon -- are combined in complex and various proportions. In crude oils, the amount of hydrogen varies from 10 to 15 percent and carbon from 80 to 89 percent by weight. Oil usually occurs with natural gas and saltwater within porous rocks. Gas is lighter than oil or water and tends to accumulate at the top of any reservoir. Most oil is lighter than water and also accumulates in the upper part of a reservoir, below the gas. Oil also contains minor amounts of other chemicals, such as sulfur and nitrogen, in its natural state or condition. Porous and permeable rocks, such as sandstone or limestone, act as depositories or reservoirs for oil and gas if there is some geologic condition that acts as a seal. If the seal or trap results from the structure of the rock, such as a fold, salt dome intrusion, or fault, it is called a structural trap. If the seal simply resulted from (1) a loss of porosity or permeability of the host rock that prevents further migration of the oil and gas or (2) the halting of the upward movement of hydrocarbons by beds pinching out against impervious cap rock, it is known as a stratigraphic trap. There are many different shapes, sizes, and types of geologic structures or traps that provide reservoirs in which petroleum is found as depicted in figure 3.  Figure 3. Structural and stratigraphic traps. (A.) Structural traps are created when porous rocks are tilted and folded, providing reservoir conditions suitable for the accumulation of petroleum; (B.) A stratigraphic trap is formed by changes in the porosity of a rock formation.  5   Perhaps the simplest means of classifying reservoirs is to group them according to the conditions causing their occurrence, as in the following: Structural Domes and Anticlines -- Reservoirs formed by folding of the rock layers or strata usually have the shape of structural domes or anticlines. These traps were filled by upward migration or movement of oil or gas (or both) through the porous strata or beds to the location of the trap. Here further movement was arrested by a combination of the form of the structure and the seal or cap rock provided by the formation covering the structure. Examples of reservoirs formed by domal structures are located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California. Examples of reservoirs formed by anticlinal structure are the Ventura Avenue and Wilmington Oil Fields in California. Fault Traps -- Reservoirs are formed when strata are broken or sheared and offset. This is called faulting. The escape of oil from such a trap is prevented by nonporous rocks that have moved into a position opposite the porous petroleum-bearing formation. The oil is confined in traps of this type because of the tilt of the rock layers and the faulting. Examples of fields of this type exist along fault zones in offshore Texas. Dome and Plug Traps -- Accumulations of oil are found in porous surrounding great plugs or masses of salt or intrusive rock that have lifted the overlying rock layers. Some typical accumulations of this nonporous salt mass that has formed domeshaped traps in overlying porous rocks, are located in the central and western offshore Gulf of formations on or pierced, deformed, or type, illustrating a and surrounding Mexico.  Unconformities -- A type of stratigraphic reservoir is formed as a result of an unconformity. Here the upward movement of oil has been halted by the impermeable cap rock laid down across the cutoff (possibly by water or wind erosion) surfaces of the lower beds. An example of this type of reservoir is the giant East Texas Field. Pinchouts -- Another type of stratigraphic reservoir is one that is sealed in its upper regions by abrupt changes in the amount of connected pore space. This may be caused in the case of sandstones by irregular depositing of sand pinching out into shale at the time the formation was laid down. In these cases, oil is confined within porous parts of the rock by the nonporous parts of the rock surrounding it. A reservoir of this type is found in the East Breaks Block 945 (Diana) Field. Often, however, the trapping mechanism results from a combination of structural and stratigraphic factors.  History of Offshore Petroleum Development The earliest offshore oil production in the United States was developed off Summerland, California, in 1896 (fig. 4). The offshore portion of the field was an extension of an onshore discovery that had been made before 1894. The offshore wells were drilled from wooden piers extending out from the shoreline. In all, more than 400 shallow wells were drilled and completed at a depth of about 600 feet.  6   Courtesy of California Historical Society and American Petroleum Institute Photographic and Film Services.  Figure 4. Summerland Oil Field, California, in the late 1800's  7   The discovery of the Creole Field in 1938 in the Gulf of Mexico, 1  miles from shore in 26 feet of water, marked the petroleum industry's first successful venture into open, unprotected waters. In November 1947, a discovery was made in Ship Shoal Block 32 off the Louisiana coast, 12 miles from shore in water 16 feet deep. This well was the first offshore well to be drilled out of sight of land. It was also the first offshore well drilled from a mobile drilling platform, thus initiating the technology that has subsequently been utilized to drill offshore oil and gas wells in the deeper waters of the United States. As the search for oil and gas moved farther offshore and into deeper waters, industry has continued to expand drilling and production technology. The technology used for exploration and production of petroleum in deeper water illustrates these advancements. Conventional steel-jacketed production platforms stand in over 1,000 feet of water off southern California and in over 1,300 feet of water off the Louisiana coast. In 1983, a compliant guyed-tower production platform was installed in 1,000 feet of water, 110 miles southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, and an exploration well in the Gulf recently has been drilled in 7,600 feet of water. In addition, offshore technology has seen the development of the tension leg platform, which is a semisubmersible drilling platform held in place by multiple cables anchored to the ocean floor. The tension of the cables makes the platform immune to heave, pitch, and role. In 1984, the drillship Discoverer Seven Seas drilled an exploratory well in over 6,900 feet of water off the coast of New Jersey (fig. 5). Our Nation's energy resources are now being produced in water depths exceeding 5,000 feet using subsea systems. In the often ice-bound waters of the Arctic, drilling units have evolved from the single-use artificial gravel islands to specially designed multiuse caissonretained islands and ice-resistant mobile units of more conventional design.  8   9   Courtesy of Philips Petroleum Co. & American Petroleum Institute  Figure 5.

Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act, which was added by the amendments of 1978, requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and maintain an OCS oil and gas leasing program that consists of both a schedule of lease sales for a 5-year period plus policies regarding the size, location, and timing for those sales. The analysis supporting the 5-year program is based on the following factors: C C C existing information concerning the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of such regions; the location of such regions with respect to, and the relative needs of, regional and national energy markets; the location of such regions with respect to other uses of the sea and seabed, including fisheries, navigation, existing or proposed sea lanes, potential sites of deep-water ports, and other anticipated uses of the resources and space of the OCS; the interest of potential oil and gas producers in the development of oil and gas resources as indicated by exploration or nomination; laws, goals, and policies of affected States that have been specifically identified by the Governors of such States as relevant matters for the Secretary's consideration; the relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of different areas of the OCS; and relevant environmental and predictive information for different areas of the OCS.  C C C C  The schedule is continually being updated and revised within the Department of the Interior. Key considerations in this process are the three objectives of the leasing program: (1) orderly resource development, (2) protection of the environment, and (3) receipt of fair market value from the sale of leases and the production of oil and gas. The following factors influence the areas that are selected for the schedule: C C initial assessments of oil and gas potential as estimated by both the Resource Evaluation Program and industry; environmental resources that might be affected by OCS development;  11   C C  the availability of technology; and the proximity to markets.  For the scheduling of sales, the OCS is divided into sections called ""planning areas."" These planning areas are large, contiguous areas, usually embracing several million acres, designating specific regions of the OCS, i.e., North Atlantic Planning Area, Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, Navarin Basin (Alaska) Planning Area, and Beaufort Sea (Alaska) Planning Area. Currently the OCS is divided into 26 planning areas (see fig. 6). These planning areas are subdivided into 3-mile by 3-mile blocks.  12   MMS/08/96  Figure 6. Federal Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas Shaded areas represent those areas removed from . consideration due to Presidential and congressional moratoria.  13   RE Program Overview The RE Program consists of seven major components: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Regulation of geological and geophysical (G&G) data collection; G&G data acquisition and analyses; Resource assessment; Resource estimation; Tract Evaluation/fair market value determination; Reserves inventory; and Technical information distribution.  These components all play a role in the program responsibilities that encompass all cycles of OCS activities. These responsibilities include the following: C Obtain and analyze proprietary G&G data and information and conduct resource and reserves studies of OCS lands to determine: (1) whether geologic conditions for energy or nonenergy minerals exist; (2) where potential concentrations of resources and reserves are located; (3) the volume of the accumulations; and (4) the economic value of the resources and reserves. Advise Department and Bureau management on matters related to the OCS leasing and regulatory programs and issues from a petroleum geology and resource economic perspective. Collect economic data/conduct studies necessary to support the development of a 5-year leasing program and ensure that the public obtains fair market value from individual lease sales under that program. Publish/make available timely information pertinent to the mineral potential of the OCS to the public, academia, and private industry. Conduct continuing reviews of available bidding systems and specific bidding variables for leasing OCS tracts and their effectiveness in accomplishing the objectives of the OCSLA and Amendments. Improve partnership efforts with coastal States in identifying and evaluating Federal OCS nonenergy mineral resources with a focus on sand for shoreline protection, beach and barrier island restoration, and wetlands protection.  C  C  C C  C  14   C  Provide technical support to the Department of State to develop mechanisms for cooperation with counterpart agencies in foreign countries and respond to invitations to provide technical assistance. Develop procedures and regulations for processing and implementing laws related to offshore exploration and development, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act.  C  Regulation of G&G Data Collection The only positive way of knowing whether an area contains petroleum is to drill one or more wells, but a number of geologic and geophysical techniques have been developed and refined over the years to assist in predicting whether there may be petroleum in an area. With these techniques, attempts are made to infer: (1) whether the requisite geologic conditions for petroleum occurrence exist, (2) where reservoirs are located, and (3) the size of the reservoirs and the probable volumes of petroleum that they may contain. Most of the information used by both the Federal Government and industry to estimate or infer the oil and gas potential of an area is acquired by G&G surveys. A considerable amount of this information is collected by lessees or under prelease exploration permits issued by the MMS to specialized data-collection firms that sell or furnish the information to oil companies and to the DOI. Processing and approval of exploration permits are responsibilities of the Resource Evaluation Program and include: reviewing of applications for permits and agreements for OCS geologic or geophysical scientific research or exploration for mineral resources; issuing permits and agreements, including terms, conditions, and stipulations; monitoring permit activity; and corresponding with prospective permittees; and, basically, ensuring that G&G activities are carried out in an environmentally safe manner. The objective of this component of the Resource Evaluation Program involves the development and implementation of the regulations, rules, and procedures that must be followed by any non-Federal party that collects prelease G&G data and information on the OCS for purposes related to mineral exploration, development, or production. The regulations governing prelease G&G exploration activities for oil, gas, and sulphur are set forth at 30 CFR Part 251 and those governing prospecting for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur are at 30 CFR Part 280. They govern the permitting, data acquisition, and release of information by MMS. The regulations prescribe when a permit or a notice is required, operating procedures, and conditions for release of data and information. They also prescribe reimbursement to permittees for reproduction costs of any data and information submitted to MMS. These regulations and associated permit forms are available at the MMS home page on the Internet. The general purpose of the regulations is to ensure that prelease exploration, prospecting, and scientific research operations in Federal waters do not interfere with each other, with lease operations, or with other uses of the area. The regulations also encourage G&G  15   data acquisition while adequately protecting the investment of data gathered and still assuring equal access and competitive balance. Adherence to these regulations will ensure that exploration and research activities will be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. The permits, issued by the Resource Evaluation Regional Supervisors, set forth the specific details for each data-gathering activity, which include the area where the data are collected, the timing of the data-gathering activity, approved equipment and methods, and other similar detailed information relevant to each specific permit. This process is outlined in figure 7. After data have been collected by permittees, the MMS selectively acquires data that are needed to augment the existing database. Industry uses these G&G data to determine the areas having potential for oil and gas production. Oil companies also use these data for preparing bids for lease sales. The MMS also acquires data that have been collected for scientific research activities for which an approved permit or filing of notice is required.  G&G Data Acquisition and Analysis As previously mentioned, the primary source of the G&G data and information used by the Resource Evaluation Program is the oil and gas industry, which conducts exploration, development, and production activities on OCS lands. While the MMS does not perform any direct data-collection activities, it does issue permits to industry for collecting prelease G&G data. Lessees and operators are also required by regulations to provide data from their leases to MMS. The MMS has access to the permitted data and information as a condition set forth in the permit. The MMS selectively obtains copies of data obtained from these activities. Data from prelease permits constitute approximately 90 percent of the MMS database. Permittees and lessees in their normal conduct of business are reimbursed for only the cost of data reproduction. However, if industry has collected data in areas not under MMS jurisdiction, e.g., State waters or adjacent foreign waters, and MMS selects such data, MMS pays the significantly higher ""market price"" for obtaining such data. The extensive amount of data and information acquired by MMS is used by RE geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers to perform a variety of analyses including (1) regional geologic studies to determine major areas of hydrocarbon potential on the OCS, (2) detailed evaluation of individual OCS tracts to determine the potential fair market value of the tract for bid evaluation purposes, and (3) estimation of the known discoveries of oil and gas as well as the development of resource estimates of possible occurrences of oil and gas yet to be discovered.  16   Receipt of application for permit t o conduct (1) either geological o r geophysical exploration for mineral resources or (2) either geological o r geophysical scientific researc h entailing the use of explosives or th e drilling of a deep test well .

Flowchart of Permit and Data Acquisition Process  17   Geophysical Surveys -- Geophysics is the application of the principles of physics at or near the surface of the Earth to determine the geology beneath the surface. In exploration geophysics, energy is transmitted into the Earth, and the recorded reflections provide the subsurface information used to delineate and identify geological structures and prospects. Geophysical surveys on the OCS include common depth point (CDP), gravity, magnetic, high-resolution, and three dimensional (3-D) surveys. C A large percentage of the geophysical data in the MMS inventory is twodimensional (2-D) CDP seismic information. Also known as common midpoint or common reflection point data, it is derived from a common location in the ocean subbottom where sound waves originating from various positions of the seismic (sound) source near the ocean surface are reflected toward the surface. The traces from different seismic profiles corresponding to the same reflection point are mathematically summed (stacked) for reflection points beneath the survey line. Simply, it measures the two-way travel time of an energy pulse from its source at the surface to various formations within the Earth strata and back to the surface. Present-day 2-D acquisitions, using digital recording and processing techniques, have been the basis for many prelease exploration judgments as MMS incorporates and builds its 3-D database. Magnetic surveys measure the magnetic field or its vertical component at a series of different locations over an area of interest. Aeromagnetic data consist of magnetic measurements made from an aircraft, and they offer measurements of larger areas. Magnetic and aeromagnetic acquisitions delineate anomalies caused by the changes in physical properties of the subsurface that lie beneath a thick layer of sediments. Gravity surveys produce measurements of the gravitational field at a series of different locations over an area of interest. The objective in exploration work is to map density differences that may indicate different rock types. Gravity data usually are displayed as anomaly maps. High-resolution surveys provide analysis of the shallow layers and identify potentially hazardous conditions such as surface faulting, potential slope failure areas, or shallow gas accumulations. In addition, these data are used to identify potential cultural and archaeological resources and are used in the assessment of nonenergy mineral resources. The evolution of 3-D seismic data and information, in conjunction with interactive computer workstations, has made it possible to more closely define and assess the potential for oil and gas occurrence on the OCS, especially with regard to subsalt prospects. The 3-D information is used to delineate, in greater detail than that of traditional 2-D information, subsurface geologic conditions associated with the occurrence of natural gas and oil. The products of a 3-D survey are three-dimensional data volumes (somewhat like cubes) as opposed to two-dimensional data  C  C  C  C  18   C  slices of the subbottom. As a result, displays are used to determine structures and stratigraphy, delineate faults, tie wells to each other, and correlate seismic data with well logs. A 3-D representation of the subsurface yields superior resolution of seismic indicators, accuracy of data location, and the ability to obtain seismic cross sections oriented in any direction desired. Geological and engineering information is also enhanced by 3-D visualization, and economic analyses are also improved. This use directly results in a better ability to do the following: S Determine fair market value for the OCS tracts being offered for lease; Assess undiscovered amounts of natural gas and oil; Quantify reserves of natural gas and oil on the OCS; and Perform postlease comparative analyses of company submitted bids for acceptance or rejection.  S S S  Workstations are essential to fully take advantage of the 3-D information as the use of it has become more sophisticated, evolving from a data tool to delineate reservoirs for development and production wells to that of an exploration tool. Most importantly, it allows for the tight integration and visualization of geophysical and geological data as well as a quick and accurate analysis of quantitative vs. qualitative parameters. Geological Surveys -- Geological surveying on the OCS consists of bottom sampling, shallow coring, and deep stratigraphic tests. These data are useful in determining the general geology of an area and whether the right types of rocks exist for petroleum formation and accumulation. C Bottom samples are obtained by dropping a weighted tube to the ocean floor and recovering it with an attached wire line. Depending upon the nature of the ocean floor, penetration is normally limited to a few tens of feet. Bottom samples can also be obtained from dredging. Shallow coring is performed by conventional rotary drilling equipment to obtain a near-surface sample of the rocks of the seabed. Choice of location is carefully controlled to avoid any shallow (geological and manmade) hazards, for example, faults or environmentally sensitive areas. Penetration is limited to 50 feet of consolidated rock. In any planning area, deep stratigraphic test wells, commonly known as continental offshore stratigraphic test (COST) wells, can be drilled to determine the geological character of rock strata. The location of such wells is carefully controlled by a permit issued by the MMS. These tests, which may be more than 20,000 feet deep, provide information that can be used by the Government and industry to evaluate tracts to be offered in a lease sale. Basically, an operator sets up a consortium of other  C  C  19   companies where drilling costs are shared. The wells are drilled in accordance with MMS regulations. All stratigraphic tests must be completed 60 days before the sale and the information is released to the public 10 years after completion of the well or 60 calendar days after the issuance of the first oil and gas lease within 50 miles (80.5 km) of the well site. A discussion of the cost well program is described by Dellagiarino (1991). The primary objective of the acquisition and analysis of G&G data is the development of maps identifying areas favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons. This is done by incorporating the data acquired through G&G surveys plus analyzing technical and scientific data and information to develop a basic knowledge of the geologic history of an area and its effects on hydrocarbon or strategic/critical minerals generation, distribution, and accumulation within the planning area.  Resource Assessment and Estimation The objective of this component of the RE program is to identify geologic plays on the OCS that offer the highest potential for natural gas and oil and development and production as well as nonenergy minerals. Following the identification of geologic plays, a thorough analysis of the play's hydrocarbon potential occurs. An assessment of the play's undiscovered resource potential, and its economic viability, is made using state-of-the-art computer-based geologic models. This will focus on the necessary studies to identify both environmental and operational constraints as well as assist in the consideration of eventual leasing decisions. The relative success of this component requires access to and use of a broad array of G&G data, information, and studies. Long lead times are often required to identify and determine whether geologic conditions exist for accumulations of minerals, whether a basin may be oil- or gas-prone, and determining the presence of reservoir rocks, source rocks, and traps necessary for natural gas and oil accumulation. The results of this work are subject to change and are updated as new data and information are generated and acquired. In the early stages, this component will focus on regional areas, but as more data and information are acquired, the focus shifts to sale- and prospect-specific areas to be offered for lease, or which are related to a specific issue, (i.e., moratoria, marine sanctuaries, quantitative analysis of legislative proposal, etc.). This information provides the basis for geological reports and associated maps that describe the geology, probability of hydrocarbon occurrence, resource potential, and potential shallow geologic hazards of the planning area. The geological reports include information concerning the regional geology and petroleum geology. The data, information, and analyses are used in the leasing process as input to the EIS as well as to other MMS and departmental decision and option documents. The maps and information also provide support for decisions made by the DOI.  20   Resource assessment work involves the study and analysis of the geology and geologic history of an area; the regional stratigraph y and geologic trends; major structural features; exploration history; study of source rocks, reservoir rocks, seals and trapping mechanism ; and, the identificati on of the most prospective portions of a planning area in terms of hydrocarbo n potential. This latter step serves as a complemen tary  process to industry interest in individual sales and aids in defining the final area identified for study in the sale-specific EIS. As previously mentioned, assessment activities range from large scale (i.e., regional or OCS-wide) to sale-specific, i.e., individual prospects. Once a sale area has been identified, the emphasis of the RE Program shifts to more detailed mapping and analyses needed to estimate the resource potential of individual prospects within the area offered for sale. These prospect-specific data, maps, and analyses are also used to determine parameters for postsale bid analyses. Since its formation in 1982, the MMS has completed systematic assessments of Federal OCS undiscovered oil and natural gas resources. These ""National"" assessments are the results of a multiyear effort by the DOI's MMS to assess the undiscovered crude oil and natural gas resources of the Nation's OCS areas. These studies were performed concurrently with an effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to assess the undiscovered oil and natural gas resources of the onshore areas of the United States and the adjacent waters within the boundaries of the coastal States. The current assessment estimates the undiscovered conventionally recoverable oil and natural gas resources located outside of known oil and gas fields on the OCS. The assessment considers recent geophysical, geological, technological, and economic information and uses a play analysis approach of resource appraisal. Areas assessed by MMS are depicted in figures 8, 9, 10, and 11. The MMS RE Program focuses upon developing estimates of the possible amounts of undiscovered natural gas and oil that may exist under Federal waters. The estimates are developed using complex computer models and methodologies that incorporate specific geologic information, mathematical and statistical analyses, risk and probability theories, and a variety of assumptions pertaining to economic scenarios, petroleum engineering data, and a variety of additional technical assumptions. Resource estimates can address vast areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Alaska, or the entire OCS, but are also made for smaller areas, such as a particular lease sale or deferral option. The estimation process requires that estimates be developed for conventionally recoverable natural gas and oil quantities that may exist but are yet to be discovered, as well as estimates for those resources that may be economically viable for exploration, development, and production under varying economic scenarios (see Appendix A). For many OCS planning areas, estimates of undiscovered resources on tracts currently leased are estimated separately from those on unleased lands. All of these must be periodically revised as economic scenarios and the lease inventory changes in each planning area. Resource estimates must also be developed to support critical analyses of potential impacts of policy options, legislative proposals, EIS's, and industry activities affecting OCS natural gas and oil activities--both current and future.  21   Figure 10.

No explicit consideration for economic viability was implied in the estimation of the undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources. The estimates of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources are presented as a range of values corresponding to different probabilities of occurrence. Undiscovered economically recoverable resources are the portion of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources that can be explored, developed, and commercially produced at given cost and price considerations using present or reasonably foreseeable technology. The estimates of economically recoverable resources are presented as a range of resource values corresponding to different resource prices. The available methods of estimating oil and natural gas resources for an area are many and differ significantly. The MMS has two primary methods: (1) number and size assessment and (2) subjective methods. Number and size assessment models require information on the number and size of accumulations discovered in a region. Consequently, discovery process models provide reliable results only in mature areas with a significant number of discoveries. The subjective methods rely less on historical records of exploration efforts and discovery records and more on descriptive geologic characteristics of a province, basin, or play. The quantities of undiscovered oil and natural gas are then estimated by quantifying volumetric reservoir variables and estimating the number of accumulations expected to exist. In both methods, a thorough analysis of the subjective probabilities (risks) of occurrence of variables leading to the formation, migration, trapping, and preservation of hydrocarbons at a play, basin, or province level is critical. The Petroleum Exploration and Resource Evaluation System (PETRIMES), a probabilistic play analysis model, developed by the Geological Survey of Canada, was chosen by MMS to be the basic platform for the present assessment of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources. Most of the resource assessment models currently used by industry and other government agencies provide estimated resources in aggregated numbers representing total resources as a distribution. However, to support MMS planning and decisionmaking related to OCS exploration and development, a knowledge of the potential number and size of undiscovered pools is essential. The PETRIMES attributes include the assessment and reporting of the: C C C number of pools/accumulations that remain to be discovered; size range of the undiscovered pools/accumulations; reservoir characteristics of the undiscovered pools/accumulations;  23   C C  pool size distributions that relate to the geologic model; and resource data in a manner suitable for economic analyses.  The PETRIMES, however, was designed to assess a single-commodity play, such as an oil play or a natural gas play. Because many OCS plays are mixed plays containing both oil and natural gas pools and because a separate estimation of both liquid (condensates and oil) and natural gas (associated natural gas and nonassociated natural gas) phases is required for an accurate economic evaluation, the MMS modified PETRIMES for OCS resource estimation. The modified version is called the Geologic Resource Assessment Program (GRASP). Likewise, MMS modified the Probabilistic Resource Estimates Offshore (PRESTO) model, used in previous MMS assessments, to accept the GRASP outputs for the number and sizes of pools to determine the economically recoverable resources at the geologic basin. As an improvement, estimates are made for economically recoverable resources over a range of specific fixed prices. These results are then reported as a continuous price-supply curve depicting the resultant price-resource relationships for geologic basins, provinces, or other areas being studied.  Tract Evaluation/Fair Market Value Determination Tract evaluation analyses estimate economic values for rights to mineral resources on individual OCS tracts. The MMS uses the values to determine if the high bids received for leases on tracts represent Fair Market Value (FMV) as mandated by the OCSLA (see Appendix B for guidelines). Immediately after a lease sale at which bids are read publicly, MMS begins the process of determining whether a bid can be accepted and a lease issued. Acceptance of a bid is based on a two-phase process. Phase 1 of the process is conducted on a tract-by-tract basis and is normally completed fairly early following the bid opening. It is designed to accept those high bids where the competitive market can be relied upon to assure receipt of FMV or where Government data indicate the tract does not contain an viable prospect. Those high bids not accepted in Phase 1 receive further evaluation in Phase 2. For those high bids, MMS geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers prepare detailed estimates of the economic value of oil and gas resources on each tract in Phase 2. The high bids are then compared to Government estimates of value. Most analyses are undertaken based upon data available at the time of the sale; however, additional geophysical and geological data may be obtained after the sale at the discretion of the Regional Director. Generally, the Regional Director must accept or reject all bids within 90 days after the date on which they are opened. Any bid not accepted within 90 days is rejected. Companies have 15 days to appeal any rejection. The reader is referred to Appendix B for a complete discussion of Phase 1 and Phase 2.  24   The resource economic value of tracts offered for lease is determined by calculating the amount of economically recoverable resources, estimating recovery factors, production profiles, exploration and development costs, operating costs, revenue streams, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis. The MMS uses a computer simulation model to perform this task. The model also incorporated geologic and economic risking. The computer model uses the MONTE CARLO or range-of-values technique of handling calculations with uncertain input data. The MMS refers to this as the MONTCAR methodology (see Appendix C). It provides a means to handle a series of subjective judgments about each variable. The burden of expressing the uncertainty is transferred from one or two individuals to the many experts in the various disciplines involved in the evaluation. As with other models, research is constantly being done to refine the methodology and procedures involved with MONTCAR. After completing the evaluations and analyses for a specific lease sale, the prospect-specific analyses are incorporated into the regional maps and analyses, and the process is repeated for the next sale.  Reserve Inventory ""Reserves"" are that portion of an identified oil or gas resource that can be extracted using current technology. The RE Program develops independent estimates of original amounts of natural gas and oil in discovered fields by conducting field reserve studies on the OCS and periodically revises the estimates of remaining natural gas and oil to reflect new discoveries or development information and annual production. The reserves inventory component of the RE Program assigns new producible leases to fields, establishes field limits and develops independent estimates of amounts of natural gas and oil (reserves and resources) associated with known fields by conducting field studies and reviews of fields, sands and reservoirs. A field is an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic trapping condition. Hydrocarbons (gas and oil) estimated on the basis of geologic knowledge to exist outside of known accumulations are undiscovered resources. Hydrocarbons whose location and quantity are known or estimated from specific geologic evidence are discovered resources. Reserves are quantities of hydrocarbons that are anticipated to be recovered from known accumulations from a given date forward. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty, depending on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available and the interpretation of the data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either unproved or proved. Unproved reserves are the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be estimated with some certainty to be potentially recoverable from known reservoirs, assuming future economic conditions and technological developments. Proved reserves are the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  25   Field naming and reserves accountability are dependent on the drilling and development phases of fields. When a lease is qualified as producible based on a new discovery well, the field limits associated with the new lease are defined through geophysical mapping using computer workstations and software. The new lease is either assigned to an existing field or becomes a new field discovery in the unproved category. When a field is in the unproved category, geophysical mapping and limited well data are the basis for defining reservoir limits and the associated reserve estimate. These estimates are reevaluated once a field is moved into the proved category and more data become available. Well logs, well field data, seismic data, and production data are continuously analyzed throughout the productive life of the field to improve the accuracy of the reserve estimate. As a producing field nears the end of its productive life (depletion), the proved reserve estimate approaches zero, but the field may have a resource estimates associated with undrilled and/or untested traps. The primary benefit of the RE Program reserve estimates activity, however, is that the detailed geological, geophysical, and engineering information necessary to estimate these amounts of natural gas and oil is also used in performing other RE Program functions in areas with known fields -- including tract evaluation, resource estimation, resource assessment, future production projections, and numerous specific field performance studies. Studies of unproven fields are continuing, especially in light of royalty reduction efforts, since any royalty rate reductions may help these fields become economically viable to develop and produce. The interim geologic information and engineering reviews supporting the reserves estimation function produce vital information for other OCS program activities as well as Royalty Management Program functions. Cooperative efforts with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the Department of Energy allows EIA to use MMS estimates to verify reporting standards and procedures by natural gas and oil companies and as critical input to their macroeconomic modeling efforts. Geologic maps and/or reserves estimates are prepared for active and depleted proved fields and unproved fields. Future workloads include (1) mapping and evaluating new fields; (2) evaluating discoveries that have not yet qualified as fields; (3) providing detailed analog field studies in support of lease sale prospect evaluations; (4) placing new producible leases in fields and determining the field limit; (5) maintaining the reserves inventory database by adding new completions to existing fields; and (6) enhancing the National Assessment as new pay sands in fields are identified. Geologic studies of proved and unproved fields continue at a consistent level attempting to reflect the discovery of new fields both in deepwater portions as well as the new discoveries on the shelf. The work associated with this effort is vital to the evaluation of exploration and production incentives and legislation considered by Congress and the Department. The MMS continues various cooperative reserve studies of offshore proved fields. As development activities related to offshore projects in frontier areas progress, MMS will become more involved with detailed geologic modeling and reserves estimation for those projected fields.  Technical Information Distribution 26   The RE Program develops important technical information regarding the hydrocarbon resources on the Federal OCS that may be useful to industry, Federal and State agencies, and the general public. An objective of the OCSLA is that such nonproprietary data and information be made available in a timely manner to assist States, local governments, industry, and the general public to participate in policy and planning decisions related to management of OCS resources. In taking steps to address the need to make information available, the RE Program has traditionally prepared OCS reports on the geology of OCS planning areas, certain offshore wells, G&G data acquisition, the deep stratigraphic test (COST) wells, and production projections for the OCS. Publicly available reports and information are available on the Internet at http://www.mms.gov. Products disseminated through the RE Program include: C Offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Oil and Gas Atlas Series: The goal of the atlas is the classification and organization of offshore Gulf of Mexico reservoirs into plays based upon geologic and engineering attributes covering two volumes.

Resource Estimation Methodology Estimating Undiscovered Conventionally Recoverable Resources The general methodology of assessing oil and natural gas resources for the three types of plays using GRASP is similar. A simplified diagram of the assessment process is presented in figure A-1. The basic steps are listed below. 1. Compile play data. 2. Generate pool size distribution from probabilistic distributions of volumetric reservoir parameters. 3. Generate a number of pools distribution. 4. Determine individual oil, natural gas, and mixed pool sizes by rank. 5. Establish individual pool size rank conditional to discovery data. 6. Generate play potential resources distribution.  Figure A-1. Sample Price-Supply Curve  Legend For Column Results Bbbl = billion barrels BOE = barrels of oil equivalent Mcf = thousand cubic feet Tcf = trillion cubic feet  34   In recognition of the differences in the extent of data and information available among the OCS areas (attributable mostly to the degree of past exploration and development activities), some variances in the use of GRASP modules and procedures were incorporated. The frontier and conceptual plays, in which available data are sparse and good analogs are not identified, are analyzed through the subjective method using GRASP. In this method, individual distributions of input variables are subjectively prepared and, through GRASP, ranked pool size distributions are generated. Most plays in the Alaska OCS and the Pacific OCS were analyzed this way. In the case of frontier plays for which the assessors feel confident that an analog exists, such as in the Atlantic OCS, the analyst can generate a pool size distribution from the statistical parameters of the appropriately scaled ranked pool size distribution of the analog plays and can estimate the play resources using GRASP. For established plays, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and in southern California where significant amounts of pool data are available from discovered fields, a pool size distribution curve for a play can be generated from the distribution of discovered pools. The estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources attributed to basins, provinces, regions, or other areas are derived by statistically aggregating the play-level resource distributions of the plays of that area.  Estimating Undiscovered Economically Recoverable Resources Generally, the field-size distributions (generated by GRASP) and geologic risk factors are the basic geologic inputs into the PRESTO model. The costs of exploration, development, and transportation, as well as tariffs based upon logical exploration, development, production, and transportation scenarios, were estimated for each OCS region, province, basin, or other operational subarea where activities, costs, or other circumstances warranted. Estimates of economically recoverable resources are then derived for a specific price by (1) subjecting the distributions to multiple computer iterations simulating the drilling of the hydrocarbon accumulations associated with the areas; (2) determining which fields and sizes are simulated to be discovered on each iteration; and (3) determining a discounted-cash-flow analysis for the area's resources using specified economic parameters. The resources that would exceed the economic hurdles are then totaled and become one data point on the price-supply curve. The process is repeated for numerous prices, and a continuous distribution curve is then generated. The Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and the Pacific contain stacked plays (i.e., plays overlie other plays at different depths). In determining the economic viability of such plays, assessors needed to consider the concurrent exploration, development, and production of possible pools in these plays. Otherwise, the estimates would be overly conservative. The current estimates of undiscovered economically recoverable OCS oil and natural gas resources were developed using the following assumptions: C C Fixed prices (no real price changes) 12-percent discount rate (after tax rate-of-return)  35   C C C C  12.5-percent or 16.7-percent royalty rate 35-percent tax rate 3-percent inflation rate Cost of exploration, development, and transportation, and tariffs with their associated development scheduling scenarios for each OCS region and portions of regions when conditions warrant Natural gas prices related to oil prices at 66 percent of the oil-energy equivalent  C  36   Appendix B. Fair Market Guidelines Summary of MMS Procedures for Determining Bid Adequacy at Offshore Oil Lease Sales: Effective August 1997 with Sale 168 The MMS has modified its existing bid adequacy procedures for ensuring receipt of fair market value on OCS oil and gas leases. In Phase 1 these procedures establish a new number of bids rule for acceptance of selected tracts. In Phase 2 these procedures expand the scope of tract evaluation; replace the geometric average evaluation of tract with a revised arithmetic average measure of the tract; eliminate the one-eighth rule for anomalous bids; and clarify the treatment of tracts identified as having unusual bidding patterns. These changes were made following a review of bidding activity in OCS sales. The new number of bids rule relies more on market-determined factors to ensure receipt of fair market value. This new rule, along with expansion of evaluation procedures beyond only tract-specific assessments, will allow for earlier acceptance on tracts that would be accepted later in the evaluation process. The revised average measure is designed to generate a better estimate of tract value when all bids fall below the Government's original estimate of tract value. The stricter screening rules associated with the revised average measure eliminate the need for the one-eighth rule. The Regional Director's expanded authority to handle documented instances of unusual bidding patterns provides flexibility to modify certain acceptance rules and allows for a decision to reject the high bid on identified tracts. The following set of bid adequacy procedures incorporates the most recent changes. During the bid review process, MMS conducts evaluations in a two-phased process for bid adequacy determination. In Phase 1 we review the bid for legal sufficiency1 and anomalies2 to establish the set of qualified bids3 to be evaluated. (1) Phase 1 partitions the tracts receiving bids into three general categories: C Those tracts that the MMS identifies as being nonviable4 based on adequate data and maps;  Legal bids are those bids that comply with MMS regulations (30 CFR 256) and the Notice of Sale. Any illegal high bid will be returned to the bidder. Anomalous bids include all but the highest bid submitted for a tract by the same company, parent or subsidiary (bidding alone or jointly). Such bids are excluded when applying the number of bids rule or any bid adequacy measure. 3 4 2  1  Qualified bids are those bids that are legal and not anomalous.  Nonviable tracts or prospects are those geographic or geologic configurations of hydrocarbons whose risk weighted most probable resource size is below the minimum economic field size for the relevant cost regime and anticipated future prices. The risk used is below the lowest level anticipated for any tract or prospect in the same cost regime.  37   C C  Those tracts where competitive market forces can be relied upon to assure fair market value; and Those tracts where opportunities for strategic underbidding, information asymmetry, collusion, and other noncompetitive practices are greatest and where the Government has the most detailed and reliable data.  Based on these categories, four Phase 1 rules are applied to all tracts receiving bids: C Pass directly to Phase 2 for further evaluation all tracts that require additional information to make a determination on viability or tract type and all drainage and development tracts. Accept the highest qualified bid on confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid on the tract is at least 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Pass to Phase 2 confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving either one or two qualified bids, or three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is less than 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Accept the highest qualified bid on confirmed and wildcat tracts determined to be nonviable.  C  C  C  In assuring the integrity of the bidding process, the Regional Director may identify an unusual bidding pattern5 at any time during the bid review process, but before a tract is accepted. If the finding is documented, the Regional Director has discretionary authority, after consultation with the Solicitor, to pass those tracts so identified to Phase 2 for further analysis. The Regional Director may eliminate all but the highest of the unusual bids from consideration when applying any bid adequacy rule, may choose not to apply a bid adequacy rule, or may reject the tract's highest qualified bid. Phase 1 procedures are generally completed fairly early following the bid opening. (2) Phase 2 applies criteria designed to resolve bid adequacy assessments by analyzing, partitioning, and evaluating tracts in two steps: C C Further mapping and/or analysis is done to review, modify, and finalize viability determinations and tract classifications. Tracts identified as being viable must undergo an evaluation to determine if fair market value has been received.  Within the context of our bid adequacy procedures, the term ""unusual bidding patterns"" typically refers to a situation in which there is an excessive amount of coincident bidding by different companies on a set of tracts in a sale. Other forms of unusual bidding patterns exist as well, and generally involve anti-competitive practices, e.g., when there is an uncommon absence of competition among companies active in a sale on a set of prospective tracts.  5  38   After completing these two steps, the following rules and procedures are used in Phase 2. C C Accept the highest qualified bid on all tracts determined to be nonviable. Accept newly classified confirmed and wildcat tracts having three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is at least 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Determine whether any categorical fair market evaluation technique(s) will be used. If so: S S Evaluate, define and identify the appropriate threshold measure(s). Accept all tracts whose individual cash flow values, if estimated by MMS and used in the bid adequacy procedures, would result in satisfaction of the threshold categorical requirements.  C  C  Conduct a full-scale evaluation, which could include the use of MONTCAR6, on all remaining tracts7 passed to Phase 2 and still awaiting an acceptance or rejection decision. Compare the highest qualified bid on each of these remaining tracts to two measures of bid adequacy: the Mean Range of Values (MROV)8 and the Adjusted Delayed Value (ADV).9 S Accept the highest qualified bid for those tracts where such a bid equals or exceeds the tract's ADV. Reject the highest qualified bid on drainage and development tracts receiving three or more qualified bids where such a bid is less than one-sixth of the tract's MROV.  S  MONTCAR is a probabilistic, cash flow computer simulation model designed to conduct a resourceeconomic evaluation that results in an estimate of the expected net present value of a tract (or prospect) along with other measures. (A description of MONTCAR is provided in Appendix C.) These include tracts not accepted by a categorical rule that are classified as drainage and development tracts and those classified as confirmed and wildcat tracts that are viable and received (a) one or two qualified bids, or (b) three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is less than 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. The MROV is a dollar measure of a tract's expected net present private value, given that the tract is leased in the current sale, allowing for exploration and economic risk, and including tax consequences including depletion of the cash bonus. The ADV is the minimum of the MROV and the Delayed MROV (DMROV). The DMROV is a measure used to determine the size of the high bid needed in the current sale to equalize it with the discounted sum of the bonus and royalties expected in the next sale, less the forgone royalties from the current sale. The bonus for the next sale is computed as the MROV associated with the delay in leasing under the projected economic, engineering, and geological conditions, including drainage. If the high bid exceeds the DMROV, then the leasing receipts from the current sale are expected to be greater than those from the next sale, even in cases where the MROV exceeds the high bid. 9 8 7  6  39   S  Reject the highest qualified bid on drainage and development tracts receiving one or two qualified bids and on confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving only one qualified bid where the high bid is less than the tract's ADV.  C  Select from the outstanding tracts10 those (a) drainage and development tracts having three or more qualified bids with the third highest such bid being at least 25 percent of the highest qualified bid and (b) confirmed and wildcat tracts having two or more qualified bids with the second highest such bid being at least 25 percent of the highest qualified bid. Compare the highest qualified bid on each of these selected, outstanding tracts to the tract's Revised Arithmetic Measure (RAM).11 For all these tracts: S Accept the highest qualified bid where such a bid equals or exceed the tract's RAM. Reject the highest qualified bid where such a bid is less than the tract's RAM.  S C  Reject the highest qualified bid on all leftover tracts, i.e., those that were in the ""outstanding"" set above but not selected for comparison to the RAM.  In some cases where the high bid is less than the MROV, the present value of Government receipts may be larger if the high bid is accepted rather than rejected. This can be the case because (1) reoffering a rejected tract results in a delay in receiving bonuses and future royalties and (2) during the interval between the current sale and reoffering, some of the tract's resources may be drained to an adjacent tract. These elements are accounted for in the DMROV, which is computed as follows: 1. Using a model such as MONTCAR, an MROV along with royalty receipts (in present value terms) is estimated at the time of the next sale, when the tract is assumed to be reoffered if its high bid is rejected in the current sale. 2. The calculation of the MROV and royalties from the next sale reflect adjustments in prices, costs, and drainage during the time interval between sales. 3. Royalties (in present value terms) are estimated under the assumption that the tract's high bid is accepted in the current sale.  These consist of those tracts having a highest qualified bid that does not exceed the MROV or the ADV, and are either (a) drainage or development tracts receiving three or more qualified bids with the highest such bid exceeding one-sixth of the tract's MROV, or (b) confirmed and wildcat tracts that are viable and receive two or more qualified bids. The RAM is the arithmetic average of the MROV and all qualified bids on the tract that are equal to at least 25 percent of the high bid. 11  10  40   4. The DMROV is computed as the difference between the discounted sum of the MROV and royalties from the next sale, and the royalties from the current sale. Under the input assumptions used, a tract whose high bid is below the MROV but exceeds the DMROV will generate a greater amount of leasing receipts if it is accepted in the current sale rather than rejected and reoffered in the next sale. The Phase 2 bid adequacy determinations are normally completed sequentially over a period ranging between 21 and 90 days after the sale. The total evaluation period can be extended, if needed, at the Regional Director's discretion (61 FR 34730, July 3, 1996).  Definitions Used by MMS in Bid Adequacy Procedures Adjusted Delayed Value (ADV): The minimum of the MROV and the DMROV. Anomalous Bids: All but the highest bid submitted for a tract by the same company--parent or subsidiary (bidding alone or jointly). Confirmed Tract: A previously leased tract having a well(s) that encountered hydrocarbons and may have produced. It contains some oil and/or gas resources whose volume may or may not be known. Delayed Mean Range of Values (DMROV): A measure of the current sale's high bid needed to ensure that leasing receipts from this sale will exceed those in a subsequent sale if the high bid is rejected and the tract reoffered. Development Tract: A tract that has nearby productive (past or currently capable) wells with indicated hydrocarbons and which is not interpreted to have a productive reservoir extending under the tract. There should be evidence supporting the interpretation that at least part of the tract is on the same general structure as the proven productive well. Drainage Tract: A tract that has a nearby well that is capable of producing oil or gas, and the tract could incur drainage if and when such a well is placed on production. The reservoir, from which the nearby well is capable of producing, is interpreted to extend under the drainage tract to some extent. Legal Bids: Those bids on a tract that comply with MMS regulations and the Notice of Sale. Mean Range of Values (MROV): A dollar measure of the MMS estimate of a tract's expected net present private value, given that the tract is leased in the current sale. Nonviable Tract/Prospect: A tract or prospect is that geographic or geologic configuration of hydrocarbons whose risk weighted most probable resource size is below the minimum economic field size for the relevant cost regime and anticipated future prices. The risk used is below the lowest level anticipated for any tract or prospect in the same cost regime.  41   Qualified Bids: The bids on a tract that are legal bids and not anomalous. Revised Arithmetic Average Measure (RAM): The arithmetic average of the MROV and all qualified bids on the tract that are equal to at least 25 percent of the high bid. Viable Tract/Prospect: A tract or prospect having a resource level (obtained by using most probable inputs from ranges of values for appropriate parameters) that exceeds the minimum economic field size for that particular cost regime. Wildcat Tract: A tract that has neither nearby productive (past or currently capable) wells nor is interpreted to have a productive reservoir extending under the tract. It has high risk in addition to sparse well control.  42   Appendix C. MONTCAR Methodology Determination of the resource economic value of a tract offered for lease involves calculating the amount of economically recoverable resources, estimating recovery factors, production profiles, exploration and development costs, operating costs, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis. The MMS uses a computer simulation model to determine the resource economic value of certain OCS tracts offered for lease by the Federal Government. The computer model utilizes the MONTE CARLO or range-of-values technique of handling calculations with uncertain input data. It provides a means to handle a series of subjective judgments about each individual variable. The burden of expressing the uncertainty is transferred from one or two individuals to the many experts in the various disciplines involved in the evaluation. This method explicitly recognizes the probabilistic nature of all variables affecting the evaluation and calculates a large number of possible outcomes based upon random samples from input probability distributions. Much of the geologic and engineering data (e.g., areal extent and thickness of the hydrocarbon pay zone, porosity, initial water saturation, recovery factors, production rates, product prices, costs, etc.) used to evaluate a tract is known with varying degrees of uncertainty. Providing a single number for the resource economic value of a tract is somewhat misleading since it provides no insight as to the relative uncertainty involved. The MONTE CARLO technique provides a range of resource economic values (net present worth (NPW)) for the tract with the probability of each value occurring being a direct consequence of the data uncertainty. The logic of the MONTE CARLO simulation method can be described as a four-step process. Step 1. Estimate the range and distribution of possible values of each variable that will affect the ultimate outcome of the venture. This requires judgments from geophysicists, geologists, paleontologists, stratigraphers, economists, and engineers. The most critical step in the process is quantifying the uncertainty involved through the use of these probability distributions. The amount of data concerning the prospect in question, the amount of information about the trend within which a prospect is located, and the experience of the scientists making the evaluation will dictate the type and shape of the probability distribution curves for each variable. Step 2. Select, at random, one value from the distribution of each variable. Compute the tract value using this combination of selected values. This determines one point in the final distribution of possible tract values. Select, at random, a second value from the distribution of each of the variables. Again compute the resulting tract value. This is the second point in the distribution of possible tract values. The random selection is statistically done in such a way that, if a large number of random selections are made (1,000 or more), the distribution of the randomly selected values closely resembles the distribution that was read in.  43   Step 3. Repeat the process 1,000 or more times, each time with a set of values selected at random from the distribution of each variable. Enough combinations of variables should be considered to adequately describe the shape and range of the distribution of tract values. For each trial (1 of the 1,000 or more repetitions) the tracts Net Present Worth (NPW) is determined from the combination of sample outcomes from each variable. Step 4. The means of the productive and dry NPW distributions are determined, the probability of hydrocarbons being present, and factors for bonus write-off and depletion are applied to determine the expected (risked) NPW of the tract. This is the mean of the range of values (MROV) commonly referred to as the Government's reservation price. A distribution of the MROV is also developed. The program also calculates what the expected NPW would be today if a tract was not leased until a later date, taking into account differences in income and excise tax payments and royalty or profit share payments; this is called the delayed MROV (DMROV). The method in effect constitutes a shift of emphasis regarding subjective judgments. Instead of requiring a single judgment about how a series of variables will interact collectively, a series of judgments are made on how each individual variable will occur.  44   The Department of the Interior Mission As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has responsibility for most of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound use of our land and water resources; protecting our fish, wildlife, and biological diversity; preserving the environmental and cultural values of our national parks and historical places; and providing for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation. The Department assesses our energy and mineral resources and works to ensure that their development is in the best interests of all our people by encouraging stewardship and citizen participation in their care. The Department also has a major responsibility for American Indian reservation communities and for people who live in island territories under U.S. administration.  The Minerals Management Service Mission As a bureau of the Department of the Interior, the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) primary responsibilities are to manage the mineral resources located on the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), collect revenue from the Federal OCS and onshore Federal and Indian lands, and distribute those revenues. Moreover, in working to meet its responsibilities, the Offshore Minerals Management Program administers the OCS competitive leasing program and oversees the safe and environmentally sound exploration and production of our Nation's offshore natural gas, oil and other mineral resources. The MMS Royalty Management Program meets its responsibilities by ensuring the efficient, timely and accurate collection and disbursement of revenue from mineral leasing and production due to Indian tribes and allottees, States and the U.S. Treasury. The MMS strives to fulfill its responsibilities through the general guiding principles of: (1) being responsive to the public's concerns and interests by maintaining a dialogue with all potentially affected parties and (2) carrying out its programs with an emphasis on working to enhance the quality of life for all Americans by lending MMS assistance and expertise to economic development and environmental protection."

NUCLEAR FUEL            Atoms are made up of three major particles:  protons, neutrons and electrons.     The most common fissionable atom is an isotope (the specific member of the atom's    family) of uranium known as uranium-235 (U-235 or U 235 ), which is    the fuel used in most types of nuclear reactors today.  Although uranium    is quite common, about 100 times more common than silver, U-235 is relatively    rare.   Most U.S. uranium is mined, in the Western United States.     Once uranium is mined the U-235 must be extracted and processed before it can    be used as a fuel.  In its final usable state, the nuclear fuel will be    in the form of a pellet roughly one-inch-long, which can generate approximately    the same amount of electricity as one ton of coal.                            TYPE OF REACTORS            Just as there are different approaches to designing and building airplanes    and automobiles, engineers have developed different types of nuclear power plants.     Two types are used in the United States: boiling-water reactors (BWRs), and    pressurized-water reactors (PWRs).  In the BWR, the water heated by the reactor core turns directly into steam    in the reactor vessel and is then used to power the turbine-generator.     In a PWR, the water passing through the reactor core is kept under pressure    so that it does not turn to steam at all -- it remains liquid.   Steam    to drive the turbine is generated in a separate piece of equipment called a    steam generator.  A steam generator is a giant cylinder with thousands    of tubes in it through which the hot radioactive water can flow.  Outside    the tubes in the steam generator,  nonradioactive water (or clean water)    boils and eventually turns to steam.  The clean water may come from one    of several sources: oceans, lakes or rivers.  The radioactive water flows    back to the reactor core, where it is reheated, only to flow back to the steam    generator.  Roughly seventy percent of the reactors operating in the U.S.    are PWR.  Nuclear reactors are basically machines that contain and control chain reactions,    while releasing heat at a controlled rate.  In electric power plants, the    reactors supply the heat to turn water into steam, which drives the turbine-generators.     The electricity is shipped or distributed through transmission lines to homes,    schools, hospitals, factories, office buildings, rail systems and other customers.           The reactor core is composed of four main elements:      THE FUEL .  Nuclear fuel consists of pellets of enriched uranium    dioxide encased in 12-foot long pencil-thick metal tubes, called fuel rods.      These fuel rods are bundled to form fuel assemblies.  A nuclear plant can    operate continuously for up to 2 years.  To run this long, a reactor must    have as many as 100 to 300 fuel assemblies.     THE CONTROL RODS .  The control rods contain material that regulates      the rate of the chain reaction.  If they are pulled out of the core,      the reaction speeds up.  If they are inserted, the reaction slows down.    THE COOLANT . A coolant, usually water, is pumped through the reactor      to carry away the heat produced by the fissioning of the fuel.  This      is comparable to the water in the cooling system of a car, which carries away      the heat built up in the engine.  In a reactor, as much as 330,000 gallons      of water flow through the reactor core every minute to carry away the heat.    THE MODERATOR .  A moderator, water, slows down the speed at which      atoms travel. This reduction in speed actually increases the opportunity to      split, thereby releasing energy.    Although engineering designs are quite complex, these four elements -- the fuel,  the control rods, the coolant and the moderator -- are the basic components of  a nuclear reactor.               ENVIRONMENT            Like all industrial processes, nuclear power generation has by-product wastes:    radioactive waste and hot water.  Because nuclear generated electricity    does not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, nuclear power plants in the    U.S. prevent about as much greenhouse has emissions as taking 5 billion cars    off our streets and highways.  Radioactive wastes are the principal environmental concern for nuclear power.     Most nuclear waste is low-level nuclear waste.  It is ordinary trash, tools,    protective clothing, wiping cloths and disposable items that have been contaminated    with small amounts of radioactive dust or particles.  These materials are    subject to special regulation that govern their storage so they will not come    in contact with the outside environment.  On the other hand the irradiated fuel assemblies are highly radioactive and    must be stored in specially designed pools resembling large swimming pools (water    cools the fuel and acts as a radiation shield) or in specially designed dry    storage containers.  The older and less radioactive fuel is kept in the    dry storage facility. It is sealed in special concrete reinforced containers.     The United States Department of Energy's long range plan is for this spent fuel    to be stored deep in the earth in a geologic repository, at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  Currently, all spent (used) fuel is stored    at the power plant at which it was used.

GX001-31-3094388	Nuclear          Energy           What is nuclear          energy, and how does it work?           TVA Nuclear          operates two different types of nuclear power plants, one using pressurized          water and the other boiling water. Sequoyah and Watts Bar Nuclear Plants          are based on a pressurized water reactor, and Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant          has a boiling water reactor.           Pressurized              water reactor diagram            Boiling water reactor diagram           A nuclear plant works            in much the same way that a TVA dam or fossil-fuel plant does, in that            large turbine blades are used to operate a generator to produce electricity.            At a hydroelectric dam, the force of the falling water spins the turbine            blades, while at a coal-fired or nuclear plant, the force of steam spins            the blades. A nuclear plant, however, uses uranium instead of coal as            a fuel to make steam.         The uranium is formed          into ceramic pellets and placed in metal tubes called fuel rods. In TVA’s          pressurized water reactors, about 51,000 fuel rods are placed in the reactor          vessel to make up the core—the part of the plant that produces heat.         When a uranium atom          splits in the process called nuclear fission, it gives off energy in the          form of heat. To regulate the heat-producing process, control rods and          borated water are used. The borated water speeds up or slows down the          fission process, and the control rods shut down the reaction when they’re          inserted between the fuel rods.         The water is heated          to about 304 degrees Celsius (580 degrees Fahrenheit). It’s kept          under high pressure to prevent it from boiling as it travels to tubes          inside four steam generators.         A secondary source          of water passes around the outside of the tubes in the steam generators.          The heat from the water inside the tubes is transferred to the secondary          source of water, which boils and turns to steam. The steam formed in the          generators is piped into the main turbine, where the force of the steam          turns the turbine blades. The turbine is connected to an electric generator          by a rotating shaft. As the turbine blades begin to spin, a magnet inside          the generator also turns, and that produces electricity.         Once the steam has          been used to drive the main turbine, the low-energy steam is converted          back to water by circulating around tubes (which carry cool water from          an adjacent lake) in a large boxlike structure called a condenser. The          condensed steam, now water, is pumped to the steam generators to repeat          the cycle. The water in the condenser tubes picks up heat from the steam          passing around the outside of the tubes. This heated water may be passed          through a 140-meter-high (459-foot) cooling tower before being returned          to the lake or reused in the plant. The three water systems are separated          from each other to ensure that radioactive water does not mix with nonradioactive.         In the boiling water          reactor design used at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, steam is produced          in the reactor core instead of in the steam generators. The turbine and          generator work to make electricity just as they do in a pressurized-water          nuclear plant or in a coal-fired plant.                      How safe is nuclear power?          The safety and health of the public and TVA employees are the first consideration          and top priority in the operation of TVA nuclear plants. Not only are          the plants designed to be safe and reliable, but TVA employees maintain          them to ensure they will operate as designed.            Maintaining a reliable          and efficient plant and a highly trained work force makes it unlikely          that a radiological incident will happen. Nevertheless, emergency preparedness          is an important part of TVA’s nuclear program. Emergency planners          work closely with federal, state, and local agencies to develop, maintain,          and practice emergency preparedness procedures. Drills are held throughout          the year to practice and coordinate the activities that allow TVA to ensure          the protection of the public and its employees.         TVA has installed            sirens within a 10-mile radius of nuclear plants to notify residents           promptly          in the event of an incident, and alert them to tune to their emergency            broadcast stations (see information, above  right). The sirens may           also be used to warn area residents          of tornadoes and other natural disasters.           Sources of radiation                                 What is radiation?          Radiation is energy emitted as invisible particles, waves, or rays. Radioactive          atoms produce radiation as they disintegrate. Everyone is exposed to small          amounts of radiation each day. Air, water, food, and sunshine are a few          sources of natural background radiation. Radiation also comes from other          sources, such as color televisions and medical x-rays.           People are concerned          about radiation exposure because it can alter or damage the human cell          structure. That is why nuclear power plants are carefully monitored and          employees are trained to limit their exposure to a level that is as low          as reasonably achievable.         The containment building,          the reactor vessel, the fuel assemblies, and several other barriers are          designed to contain radiation and protect plant workers and the public          living near a nuclear plant from any exposure to elevated levels of radiation.         Repeated surveys          around TVA’s operating nuclear plants have shown no detectable increase          in radiation levels over normal background levels.                                                     Generating Plants         Download       a color brochure about  TVA’s nuclear plants  that             explains how they work and includes data on each plant (PDF file,       278 kb).

The agency succeeded the Atomic Energy      Commission, which previously had responsibility for both developing and regulating      nuclear activities. Federal research and development work for all energy sources,      as well as nuclear weapons production, is now conducted by the U.S. Department      of Energy.      Under its responsibility to protect public health and safety, the NRC has      three principal regulatory functions:       (1) establish standards and regulations; (2) issue licenses for nuclear facilities      and users of nuclear materials; and       (3) inspect facilities and users of nuclear materials to ensure compliance      with the requirements. These regulatory functions relate to both nuclear power      plants and to other uses of nuclear materials -- like nuclear medicine programs      at hospitals, academic activities at educational institutions, research work,      and such industrial applications as gauges and testing equipment.      The NRC places a high priority on keeping the public informed of its work.      The agency maintains a current website and a public document room in Rockville,      Maryland (NRC headquarters) as well as holds       public hearings, public meetings in local areas and at NRC offices, and discussions      with individuals and organizations.      WHY REGULATE ?      The nuclear industry is strictly regulated because of the potential hazards      involved in using radioactive materials. These radioactive materials give      off radiation, which can be hazardous to people if they are exposed to it      in significant amounts. The extent of the risk depends on the type and amount      of radiation emitted by the radioactive material, the distance between the      source of the radiation and a person, and the length of time a person is exposed      to the radiation.      The risks can be lessened by reducing any or all of these factors. The hazard      is less if there is a shielding material like lead or concrete to block some      of the radiation, if a person moves farther from the radiation source, or      if the exposure time is reduced.       If radioactive materials are properly handled and regulated, they do not      pose a significant risk to the public or to workers.      Radioactivity from natural sources is present throughout the world. People      are continuously exposed to low-level radiation from radioactive materials      in the earth and from cosmic rays from space. Exposure to natural radiation      can be affected by geography as well as lifestyle. For example, radiation      levels are higher in the mountains, and travel by airplane contributes additional      exposure because of increased cosmic radiation at high altitudes. Most people      also receive some radiation exposure from medical and dental x-rays and other      medical procedures.      The NRC's regulatory program establishes limits for radiation exposure to      workers and the general public as a result of the various uses of radioactive      materials licensed by the NRC. In addition, the NRC requires users to take      steps to keep exposures well below the limits.      NRC ORGANIZATION      The NRC is headed by a five-member Commission. The Commissioners are appointed      to 5-year terms by the President of the United States with confirmation by      the Senate. A Chairman is designated by the President.      The NRC staff numbers approximately 3,000 with a budget of about $500 million.      Roughly two-thirds of the NRC employees work in the agency's headquarters      in Rockville, Maryland. The remainder are located primarily in four regional      offices (see map on opposite page) or at resident inspector offices at each      commercial nuclear power plant and some fuel cycle facilities.      NRC REGULATIONS      The NRC sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow.      These rules are intended to protect the persons using the radioactive materials      and the general public from the potential hazards of radioactivity. Many NRC      regulations have been established or changed, as necessary, based on the recommendations      of the NRC staff. Members of the public and interested organizations can also      request changes in regulations. The views of the public, of the industry being      regulated, and of other interested parties are usually solicited before new      rules or changes are adopted.      REGULATORY RESEARCH      As part of its regulatory program, the NRC conducts an extensive research      program to provide independent information and expertise to support its safety      decisionmaking and to assess potential technical issues. This NRC research      is performed by Government laboratories, universities, and other research      institutions. Topics of inquiry include such subjects as the durability and      integrity of reactor components, the impact of natural phenomena like earthquakes      and tornadoes on nuclear facilities, radioactive waste disposal technology,      and the way workers react to instruments and systems in nuclear facilities.           LICENSES      Any organization or individual intending to possess or use radioactive materials      must obtain a license. The use of very small amounts of radioactive materials      -- like the tiny radiation source inside many smoke detectors -- is exempt      from licensing or is authorized by a general license, which does not require      active control to assure safety. However, for the manufacturing of these and      similar items, a specific license involving regulatory control is required.      The NRC licenses all commercial nuclear fuel facilities involved in the      processing and fabrication of uranium ore into reactor fuel. Licenses for      over 100 commercial nuclear power plants and their operators are issued also      by the NRC. Licenses for other uses of radioactive materials are issued either      by the NRC or by State Governments under NRC-approved regulatory programs.      About 5,000 licenses for radioactive materials are under the jurisdiction      of the NRC, and about 15,500 are under the jurisdiction of those States known      as Agreement States that regulate certain radioactive materials under agreements      with the NRC.      States also have regulatory jurisdiction over certain radioactive substances      that occur naturally (primarily radium and radon) or are produced by machines      called particle accelerators.      The NRC or State license specifies the types and quantities of radioactive      materials that may be possessed and used, as well as any specific restrictions      on their use. Typically, licenses describe the location of use, the training      and qualifications of workers, specific procedures for using the materials,      and any special safety precautions required. The license holder must follow      the specific license requirements as well as the more general NRC regulations.      POWER PLANT LICENSES      In the past, nuclear power plants required two licenses -- a construction      permit, which allowed the facility to be built, and an operating license,      which permitted operation of the facility once it was completed.      In 1989 the NRC adopted a streamlined licensing process that encourages      the use of standardized and pre-approved designs for any future plant proposals      and provides for the issuance of a combined construction permit and operating      license. Another feature of the streamlined process is possible early approval      of sites for nuclear plants. This combined licensing process provides for      the early resolution of virtually all issues before construction begins. This      combined license also incorporates a program of tests, inspections, and related      acceptance criteria that are necessary and sufficient to show that the plant      has been properly built. These criteria must be met before operation can begin.      This process provides for public hearings on the certification of the standard      design. It also provides for public hearings on the site approval and on the      issuance of a combined construction permit and operating license. As the plant      nears completion, a public hearing could be held if a significant question      exists on whether the criteria of the combined license have been met.      The licenses for nuclear power plants are issued for a 40-year period. Licenses      for currently operating plants will begin to expire soon after 2000. The NRC      has developed a process for extending licenses for an additional 20 years.      License renewals have been approved for a handful of reactors and more requests      for license extensions are in the pipeline.       Licenses for nuclear power plants can be amended and updated as the result      of operating experiences at that plant or at other plants. When necessary,      the NRC can impose new regulations or require changes in operating procedures      or equipment to improve the safety of nuclear power plant operations.      In addition to licensing the facility, the NRC also licenses the individuals      who operate the controls of the reactor. Licenses fall into two categories      -- reactor operator and senior reactor operator. The second category is necessary      for supervisory positions. Before operator licenses are issued, individuals      must complete an extensive training program conducted by the utility and pass      license examinations administered by NRC examiners. Once licensed, the operators      continue to receive training and are periodically tested to show they remain      qualified to operate the plant.      INSPECTIONS      The NRC periodically inspects all facilities it licenses to ensure that      their activities meet NRC regulations and the terms of their licenses. These      inspections vary in scope and frequency according to the relative hazard of      the authorized activities. Throughout the construction period and operating      life of a nuclear power plant, for example, numerous inspections are conducted      each year. A small medical or research facility, using limited quantities      of radioactive materials, might be inspected every few years.      For nuclear power plants and certain fuel cycle facilities, the NRC inspection      program includes the work of NRC resident inspectors, who are stationed at      the site on a full-time basis; inspections by specialists based in regional      offices and NRC headquarters; and special team inspections made up of personnel      from the regional offices and from NRC headquarters. Normal inspections consist      of examination of a sample of the work being performed by a utility or facility      owner. If evidence of problems is found, the inspector will focus       on that work area in more detail.      The core of the NRC inspection program for nuclear power plants is carried      out by the resident inspectors; at least two inspectors are assigned to each      site.      The inspection specialists, based in regional offices, review plant security,      emergency planning, radiation protection, environmental monitoring, periodic      testing of plant equipment and systems, fire protection, construction activities,      and other more specialized areas.      During the course of a year, NRC specialists may conduct 10 to 25 routine      inspections at each nuclear power plant and several inspections at fuel facilities,      depending on the activities at the facilities and problems that may occur.      The special team inspections may focus on a specific activity, like maintenance      or security, or a team may be sent to the facility to look at a specific operating      problem or accident.      All inspections and the findings by the inspectors are documented in inspection      reports. These reports are sent to the facility to inform the utility of the      findings. Inspection reports are also maintained for public review at its      Public Document Room in Rockville, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. (Certain      sensitive information --       principally on nuclear facility security -- may be withheld from public disclosure.)      When the inspections uncover violations of NRC requirements, the agency      has a range of enforcement actions. The basic action is issuance of a notice      of violation, which requires the licensee to correct the problem and take      steps to prevent a recurrence of the violation. The licensee's response must      be acceptable to the NRC.      For more serious violations or repetitive ones, the NRC may fine utilities      and other licensees up to $120,000 a day for each violation.      If serious questions exist about the safety of NRC-licensed activities,      the NRC may issue orders requiring that licensed activities be halted or an      individual be removed from work involving NRC-licensed materials. NRC orders      also may modify, suspend, or revoke a license.      Licensed activities, if halted, may not be resumed until the safety and      management problems are corrected and the NRC approves the resumption of work.      A licensee or individual who chooses to contest a fine or an order has the      right to a hearing before the NRC.      The performance of each operating nuclear power station is evaluated quarterly      using the findings of NRC inspections and performance indicators--data which      monitors the effectiveness of plant safety systems and procedures. Once a      year, the NRC prepares a more extensive performance report for each plant      and discusses the assessment with the licensee in a meeting open to the public.      The plant assessments, inspection reports, and other evaluation documents      are made available at www.nrc.gov/ras/ on NRC's web site.      On occasion, the NRC receives allegations of wrongdoing involving misconduct      by licensees or their contractors. Allegations of possible criminal activities      are handled by the professional investigative staff of the NRC Office of Investigations.      These investigations may result in civil enforcement action or criminal prosecution      against licensees, individuals, or others.      THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE      The nuclear fuel cycle (shown below) begins with the milling of uranium      ore extracted from the earth at uranium mines to produce uranium concentrate      called ""yellowcake."" The yellowcake is converted into uranium hexafluoride      gas at a special facility and loaded into cylinders. The cylinders are sent      to a gaseous diffusion plant, where uranium is enriched for use as reactor      fuel. The enriched uranium is then converted into oxide powder, fabricated      into fuel pellets (each about the size of a fingertip), which are loaded into      metal fuel rods about 12 feet long and bundled into reactor fuel assemblies      at a fuel fabrication facility. Assemblies are then transported to nuclear      power plants, non-power research reactor facilities, and naval propulsion      reactors for use as fuel.      Eight major fuel fabrication and production facilities are licensed to operate      in the United States and two enrichment facilities are regulated by the NRC.      Because they handle extremely hazardous material, these facilities must take      special precautions to prevent theft, diversion by terrorists, and dangerous      exposures by workers and the public to nuclear material. The NRC licenses      and regularly inspects these plants to ensure that they are safely operated.      HOW A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WORKS      Power plants change one form of energy into another. Electrical generating      plants convert heat, the energy of wind or falling water, or solar energy      into electricity.      A nuclear power plant is one of those plants that converts heat into electricity.      Other types of heat-conversion plants burn coal, oil, or gas for a heat source      that is used to produce electricity.      The heat -- no matter what the source -- is normally used to heat water      to the boiling point and produce steam. This steam is then carried by pipes      to a turbine -- which has a series of fan blades on a shaft. The force of      the steam pushes against the blades, turning the turbine.      The turbine is connected to a generator. As the turbine shaft spins, the      generator turns and produces electricity. This electricity is then carried      by wires to the homes, businesses, and institutions where the electricity      is used.      Electricity is one of the few forms of energy that can easily be moved from      one place to another. Electrical energy can be produced in large quantities      at one location and transported by wires to many different places.      We can see coal, oil, or gas burning -- and we know from experience that      it produces heat. This is the sort of energy many people use to heat their      homes. Some furnaces heat air, which is blown through ducts into each room;      others heat water, which is piped throughout the house into radiators where      the water gives off some of the heat it absorbed from the burning fuel.      Nuclear energy -- as it is used in a nuclear power plant -- cannot be seen.      There is no burning of fuel in the usual sense. Rather, energy is given off      by the nuclear fuel as certain types of atoms split into pieces. This energy      is in the form of fast-moving particles and invisible radiation. As the particles      and radiation move through the fuel and surrounding water, the energy is converted      into heat.      The heat is the useful energy resulting from the splitting of atoms. The      radiation energy itself can be hazardous and requires special precautions      to protect people and the environment.      To understand this process let's look at a nuclear reactor -- which is a      large water-filled vessel containing the nuclear fuel. Water in the reactor      is heated by the nuclear reaction -- and the heat is carried off to spin the      turbine.      URANIUM FUEL      The fuel of a nuclear plant is uranium, but only a certain type of uranium      atom can be easily split to produce energy. This type of uranium atom -- called      uranium-235 -- is less than 1 percent of uranium as it is mined. To make fuel      for reactors, the uranium ore is purified and then processed to increase the      percentage of uranium-235 up to 5 percent of the uranium. This percentage      is enough for a continuous splitting of uranium atoms -- but much less than      the percentage necessary for a nuclear weapon, which requires almost 100-percent      pure uranium-235. The low percentage of uranium-235 in reactor fuel is one      of the reasons a plant can never explode like an atomic bomb.       To increase the percentage of uranium-235, a process called gaseous diffusion      is used. This process heats natural uranium to form a gas, and then separates      the lighter molecules of uranium-235 from the heavier molecules of uranium-238      (another version of uranium), by forcing them through a membrane with tiny      openings. Because the uranium-235 is lighter, it moves through the membrane      more easily, and the two gases can then be separated, increasing the concentration      of uranium 235, and ""enriching"" the fuel.      When a uranium-235 atom splits --or ""fissions,"" to use the technical term      -- it gives off energy in the form of radiation and also as fast-moving pieces      of the original atom. One of these pieces, which is called a neutron, can      collide with another uranium-235 atom and cause it to split, too. A continuing      series of these atomic splits, each triggering another one, is called a chain      reaction.      Uranium-235 will split, or ""fission,"" spontaneously, but these spontaneous      atomic splits aren't frequent or reliable enough to use as an energy source.      The pieces fly away too fast and don't cause the fission of another atom.      The pieces need to be slowed down so that they can collide with another uranium-235      atom and continue the chain reaction.      Several types of materials can be used to slow down the atomic particles,      but most nuclear power plants (including all of those now operating in the      United States) use water as the ""moderator"" -- the material that slows down      the particles to allow the chain reaction to continue.      To control the chain reaction, reactors have control rods which can be inserted      into the reactor to absorb the neutrons as they are given off, thus slowing      or stopping the chain reaction.      TWO REACTOR TYPES      Two main types of reactors are in operation in the United States -- the      pressurized water reactor (PWR) and the boiling water reactor (BWR). About      two-thirds of the reactors are PWRs, and one-third are BWRs.      The PWR is a two-stage system that keeps the water in the reactor under      high pressure so that it does not boil. Piping carries this heated water to      large cylinders called steam generators. The heated reactor water flows through      thousands of tubes in the steam generator. The tubes are surrounded by a secondary      water supply that boils and produces steam, which is carried away by pipes      to spin the turbine generator.      The reactor cooling water then returns to the reactor to be reheated and      circulated back to the steam generator, again in a continuous loop.      The BWR is a single-stage system that allows the water in the reactor to      boil and produce steam, which is then piped directly to the turbine generator.      In both types of reactors, once the steam loses its energy in spinning the      turbine, it flows into a condenser. Because not all the heat energy in the      steam can be converted into electricity, the leftover heat must be carried      away by cooling water pumped through the condenser. The condenser contains      thousands of tubes carrying cool water, which causes the steam to condense      back to water. The water is collected in the condenser and pumped back to      be reheated, either in the reactor itself for a BWR or in the PWR steam generator.      The condenser cooling water is drawn from a lake, river, or ocean. This      water does not actually pass through the reactor, but only through the condenser      tubes to cool the steam after it goes through the turbine. There is no contact      between the condenser cooling water and the reactor cooling water or the reactor      components themselves.      This outside cooling water, heated as it passes through the condenser, is      returned to the source lake, river, or ocean. Many nuclear plants as well      as other types of power plants or industrial facilities use cooling towers,      cooling lakes or ponds, or other techniques to reduce the effects of heated      water discharged directly back into the river, lake, or ocean. With cooling      towers, the water, once cooled, is usually pumped back into the condenser      to be used again to carry off heat. Only a small portion of the water is returned      to the natural water source.      Once the steam is produced, the process and equipment used to generate electricity      are similar in nuclear power plants and fossil-fueled power plants. Fossil-fueled      plants also discharge heated water to the environment or use cooling towers      or other means to cool the water from the condenser.      RADIOACTIVE BYPRODUCTS      Because the fission reaction produces radioactive materials, which can be      hazardous, nuclear power plants are equipped with safety systems to protect      workers, the public, and the environment.      Radioactive materials require careful use because they produce radiation      -- a form of energy that can damage human cells and, depending on the amount      and duration of the exposure, can potentially cause cancer over long periods      of time. A person can be exposed to radiation in two ways. Internal exposures      occur if a radioactive material is inhaled or ingested and remains deposited      in the body. External exposures can result from a person being close to a      radioactive material without adequate shielding.      In the reactor, most of these hazardous radioactive substances -- called      fission byproducts -- are trapped in the fuel pellets themselves or in the      sealed metal tubes holding the fuel. Small amounts of these radioactive fission      byproducts, principally gases, however, become mixed with the water passing      through the reactor. Other impurities in the water are also made radioactive      as they pass through the reactor. The water is processed and filtered to remove      these radioactive impurities and then returned to the reactor cooling system.      Minute quantities of radioactive gases and liquids are ultimately released      to the environment under controlled and monitored conditions during normal      plant operations.      Radioactive materials lose their radioactive properties over time. Some      are short-lived and become nonradioactive forms in seconds or minutes. Other      radioactive elements take much longer to lose their radioactivity. This process      is called radioactive decay.      The NRC has established limits for the release of radioactivity during routine      operations. These limits are based on guidelines set by the Environmental      Protection Agency and by national and international standard-setting groups.      Although the effects of very low levels of radiation are difficult to detect,      the NRC limits are based on the conservative assumption that radiation exposures      to members of the public should only be a small fraction of what they receive      from natural environmental radiation.      Experience has shown that nuclear plants typically release only a small      portion of the NRC limits during normal operations. A person spending a full      year at a nuclear plant boundary would receive an additional radiation exposure      of less than 1 percent of the radiation exposure everyone receives from naturally      occurring radiation. (Natural environmental radiation exposures average 300      millirems per year.) Year-round exposure at the plant boundary is an additional      1 to 2 millirems or less.      The NRC also sets limits for radiation exposure to individuals working at      nuclear plants and other facilities using radioactive materials. Because these      individuals receive the radiation exposure as part of their employment and      because they receive special training on radiation protection, the occupational      limits are higher than those permitted for the general public. Radiation workers      must wear devices to measure the radiation to which they are exposed.      The environmental impact of routine operations at a nuclear plant is very      small. But because of the radioactivity remaining in the reactor fuel, the      plant must have effective safety systems to prevent an accident that would      lead to a large amount of that radioactivity being released from the plant.      The likelihood of such an accident is remote, but the possibility that one      could occur leads to special care in design, construction, and operation of      nuclear power plants.      REACTOR SAFETY SYSTEMS       A nuclear power plant is equipped with four major types of safety systems      to prevent accidents and reduce their effects if one should occur:            A system to quickly shut down a reactor and stop the fission chain reaction.       Numerous systems to control reactor pressure and to continue cooling the       reactor fuel -- that is, to carry away the heat that continues to be generated       even after the reactor is shut down.       Electrical, control, and instrument systems for safety systems and for       monitoring reactor conditions.       System of barriers to contain radioactivity if it should escape from the       reactor fuel in an accident.           SHUTDOWN SYSTEMS       Each reactor has a system to insert the control rods into the reactor core      within seconds to stop the fission reaction. This immediate shutdown -- called      a reactor ""scram"" or reactor ""trip"" -- can be triggered by a reactor operator      or by automatic controls that protect the reactor from any unusual conditions      in the plant.      COOLING AND PRESSURE - CONTROL SYSTEMS      When a reactor is operating, the heat energy from the fission reaction is      carried off in the cooling water. That energy is used as steam to spin the      turbine generator, making electricity. A reactor shutdown stops the fission      reaction, but heat is still generated by the radioactive fission byproducts,      which have built up in the reactor fuel. Much less heat is created than when      the reactor is operating, but the heat is still sufficient to damage the fuel      if it is not cooled. As time passes after the reactor shutdown, the amount      of heat produced in the fuel in the reactor core decreases. Continued cooling      of the fuel remains necessary, however. Both normal cooling systems and emergency      cooling systems are available. Each system has at least two parallel parts      so that if one fails, the other part would still be available to continue      to cool the reactor.      The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) consists of pumps and valves and      pipes that are independent of the normal cooling system. The ECCS contains      equipment that can pump at high pressure to inject water into the reactor      when the pressure inside is at the high levels maintained during operation.      In addition, low pressure systems pump water at lower pressures, such as those      that might occur if a cooling water pipe broke and allowed pressure inside      the reactor to drop.      The reactor systems also contain valves that can be opened to reduce pressure      by releasing steam. These relief valves open automatically if pressure gets      too high in the reactor system. Some of the valves can be opened using controls      in the reactor control room. These pressure-      reduction systems can also be used to reduce reactor pressure so that the      low pressure cooling systems can function.       SAFETY SYSTEM POWER      Most of the safety systems are powered by electricity, although some pumps      use steam to drive them in order to have an alternative source of power. Because      of this reliance on electrical power, nuclear plants are required to have      multiple sources of electricity.      A nuclear plant uses a portion of the power it generates to run plant equipment.      A plant also must have at least two connections to the utility's electrical      distribution system so that it can immediately shift to offsite power sources      if a shutdown occurs. Should there be a failure in the offsite power connections,      each plant has emergency diesel generators with sufficient capacity to supply      electricity to the critical safety systems.      The control and instrument systems normally use direct current (DC) electricity,      the kind of power found in batteries. For these systems, large banks of batteries      provide DC power if there is an interruption in the normal sources of electricity.      CONTAINING RADIOACTIVITY      Nuclear power plants have three principal barriers to prevent the release      of radioactivity -- the sealed fuel rods, the reactor vessel and associated      components, and the structure housing the reactor, called the reactor containment.      A serious reactor accident could damage the fuel rods, which form the first      barrier, if adequate cooling does not occur. Overheated fuel rods could leak      or break apart and eventually melt. Possible damage to the reactor cooling      system piping could breach the second barrier.      Even with the failure of these first two barriers, the reactor containment      is designed to hold radioactive material that might otherwise be released      to the outside environment. One type of reactor containment is a large cylinder-shaped      building made out of reinforced concrete with a steel lining. It is designed      to withstand the pressures that might build up inside as steam and gases escape      from the reactor during an accident. Another type of containment, called a      pressure suppression containment, has a large water-filled pool to cool the      steam and reduce the pressure buildup in the containment.      The NRC requires that the reactor containment be periodically tested to      show it meets requirements to prevent leakage from inside the structure.      Although reactor containments were designed to cope with many types of serious      reactor accidents, they may not withstand the conditions that result from      an extremely unlikely accident in which all cooling capability is lost in      the reactor. Under these circumstances, the energy produced by the radioactivity      remaining in the fuel could cause the fuel to melt. Melting of the fuel could      eventually lead to a pressure buildup in the containment that could cause      radioactive gases to leak through seals and gaskets around the containment.      The molten fuel could also damage the concrete base of the containment, leading      to a possible release of radioactivity. Even in these cases, however, most      of the long-term hazardous radioactive material would remain inside the containment      structure.      In the only major commercial power reactor accident in the United States,      the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was extensive fuel damage. Radioactive      gases and contaminated cooling water filled the containment. Although some      radioactivity was released to the atmosphere by an indirect route, the containment      itself performed as designed and kept the radioactivity safely bottled up      inside. The effectiveness of the containment was the major factor in preventing      the release of large amounts of radioactive materials to the environment.      In 1986 a much more serious accident occurred at Chornobyl in the former      Soviet Union. The reactor was very different from those used in the United      States. The plant had no containment system like that of U.S. plants. The      Chornobyl accident severely damaged the reactor core, releasing large quantities      of radioactivity to the environment. Radioactive material was deposited in      nearby countries, and radioactivity was detectable at very low levels in the      United States.      WHAT IF?      Although a major reactor accident is unlikely and each plant is equipped      with safety systems to prevent or cope with an accident, additional measures      help protect public heath and safety.      The first is special training given to the reactor operators in the handling      of emergency situations. One of the lessons learned as a result of the Three      Mile Island accident was that reactor operators needed to practice how they      would handle emergencies. Detailed emergency operating procedures have been      prepared and the operators have been trained to use them. In addition, most      nuclear power plants use computer-based simulators for training in both routine      and abnormal situations. These simulators are laid out just like the plant's      control room with all of the controls and instrumentation. Computers let the      operators practice dealing with emergencies as they occur in the simulator's      control room.      The Three Mile Island accident also pointed out the need for improved planning      by Federal, State, and local governments to deal with possible reactor accidents.      The NRC now requires that emergency plans be prepared for evacuation or other      actions to protect the residents in the vicinity of nuclear plants. These      plans usually cover an area about 10 miles in all directions around each nuclear      plant. The utility has its own emergency plan to notify government officials      of a possible emergency and to provide them with information and recommendations.      State and local governments have detailed plans for sheltering and evacuation      of residents if necessary. Federal emergency plans include Federal personnel,      equipment, and resources needed to respond to a nuclear power plant accident.      The NRC would closely follow the handling of an accident by a utility and      investigate the causes of the accident.      These emergency plans are tested through emergency exercises that simulate      a serious reactor accident. Utility personnel and government officials follow      their emergency plans in gathering information, consulting with each other,      and issuing instructions to the public. These emergency exercises sometimes      include small-scale evacuation drills for schools, nursing homes, and other      institutions.      The NRC must determine that there is reasonable assurance that evacuation      or other steps can be taken to protect area residents in the event of a major      reactor accident. To make this determination, the NRC reviews the utility's      plans, conducts inspections, and considers the assessment of State and local      planning by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.      NUCLEAR INSURANCE      Congress has established a system of ""no-fault"" insurance to provide liability      coverage in the event of a major reactor accident. This insurance program,      initiated under the Price-Anderson Act, combines commercial insurance and      self-insurance by the nuclear industry. Large nuclear plants are required      to have the maximum amount of liability insurance that is commercially available,      currently $200 million. In addition, each licensed reactor is liable for a      $75.5 million assessment to provide funds in the event of a major accident      at a plant in the United States. (No reactor would be assessed more than $10      million in any one year.)       With over 100 commercial nuclear power plants in the United States, the      combination of commercial insurance and industry self-insurance exceeds $8      billion. This is the total liability limit for an accident under the Price-Anderson      Act and no claims are required to be paid in excess of this amount. Congress,      however, will consider the need for providing an additional source of funds      should $8 billion prove inadequate.      The Price-Anderson Act provides for liability insurance coverage for actual      damages incurred by anyone affected by a major reactor accident. Besides the      coverage for offsite public liability claims, the NRC requires that utilities      maintain $1 billion in onsite property damage insurance to provide funds to      deal with cleanup of the reactor site after an accident.      RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL      During normal operations, a nuclear power plant generates two types of radioactive      wastes -- high-level waste, which consists of used fuel (usually called spent      fuel), and low-level wastes, which include contaminated equipment, filters,      maintenance materials, and resins used in purifying water for the reactor      cooling system. Other users of radioactive materials also generate low-level      wastes.      Each type of waste is handled differently.      HIGH-LEVEL WASTE      Typically, the spent fuel from nuclear power plants is stored in water-filled      pools at each reactor site and at one storage facility in Illinois. However,      several utilities have begun using dry cask storage pending final disposal.      In this way, spent fuel is stored in heavy metal or concrete containers placed      on concrete pads adjacent to the reactor facility. From one-fourth to one-third      of the reactor fuel is removed and replaced during refueling. Reactors are      normally refueled every 12 to 18 months.      Spent fuel is highly radioactive because it contains the fission byproducts      that were created while the reactor was operating. One characteristic of radioactive      material is that it decays or loses its radioactivity at a set rate. Each      radioactive component has a different rate of decay called its half-life --      the time it takes the material to lose half of its radioactivity. Some fission      byproducts have a half-life of a few seconds; others have half-lives of hundreds      or thousands of years.      When fuel is first removed from the reactor, the short-lived radioactive      materials are still present. But over time, these substances decay, leaving      the longer-lived materials as the principal substances for disposal. These      materials include cobalt-60 (5-year half-life), cesium-137 (30-year half-life),      and plutonium-239 (24,400-year half-life).      Special procedures are needed in the handling of the spent fuel, since the      radiation levels can be very dangerous without proper shielding. The water      in the spent fuel storage pool provides cooling and adequate shielding from      the radiation to protect workers in a nuclear plant. Concrete and steel in      dry casks provide adequate protection, too.      Although most of the spent fuel remains stored at individual plants, some      spent fuel has been shipped to offsite interim storage facilities. One offsite      storage facility operates in Illinois. These shipments have used heavily shielded      shipping containers designed to withstand the conditions that might occur      during a shipping accident. Spent fuel has been shipped by rail and by truck.      The NRC certifies each shipping container that meets Federal requirements,      and the Department of Transportation sets the rules for actual transportation      of the spent fuel.      Some of the components in spent fuel remain hazardous for a long time. Permanent      disposal of spent fuel, therefore, requires a disposal facility that provides      reasonable assurance that the waste will remain isolated for thousands of      years.      The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing plans for a permanent disposal      facility for spent fuel from nuclear power plants as well as for the high-level      waste produced by the Nation's nuclear weapons production activities.       Congress has directed DOE to focus on a proposed site at Yucca Mountain      in southern Nevada for this waste disposal facility. Site studies are still      under way to determine if the site is adequate for long-term disposal of the      high-level waste.      DOE would design, build, and operate the facility, and the NRC would regulate      it. The NRC must approve the site and design for the facility and must inspect      it during construction and operation.      Although some nuclear plants have adequate capacity to store the spent fuel      they generate until a DOE site is available for disposal, other plants, particularly      the older ones, may soon run out of storage space in their spent fuel pools.      DOE and the nuclear industry are considering various options to store additional      spent fuel, including dry storage, construction of additional offsite interim      storage facilities, and techniques for storing more fuel in the existing spent      fuel storage pools.       LOW-LEVEL WASTE      Low-level radioactive waste, whether from a nuclear power plant or from      other users of radioactive material, is shipped to licensed commercial disposal      facilities where it is packaged and placed in burial trenches and covered      with soil. Less than half of the waste volume is from nuclear power plants;      the remainder is generated by hospitals, research institutes, and other users      of radioactive materials.       In 1980 Congress mandated that each State be responsible for assuring the      availability of disposal capacity for commercial low-level waste produced      in the State. States could provide for disposal either individually or as      a group by joining together in a regional agreement. The individual States      or State groups are in the process of selecting new burial sites or, in some      cases, will use the facilities that have been operating.       TRANSPORTATION      About 3 million packages of radioactive materials are shipped each year      in the United States -- by highway, rail, air, and water. Regulating the safety      of these shipments is the joint responsibility of the U.S. Department of Transportation      (DOT) and the NRC.      The Federal regulatory system protects transport workers and the public      by setting performance standards for the packages and by setting limits on      the radioactive contents and radiation levels for packages and vehicles. Information      on radioactive shipments is provided by package marking and labeling, vehicle      placards, and shipping papers describing the materials.      DOT has regulatory jurisdiction over radioactive shipments while the material      is in transit. DOT also establishes shipping categories, sets the standards      for labeling of radioactive shipments, and establishes criteria for packages      used for smaller quantities of radioactive materials. The NRC, which licenses      the organizations shipping and receiving the radioactive materials, assures      that its licensees comply with the DOT shipping requirements. The NRC also      establishes the requirements for the design and manufacture of packages for      larger quantities of radioactive materials.      Typical of small-quantity shipments --using packages meeting DOT requirements--are      radioactive materials for medical diagnostic tests and therapy.      These shipments constitute the major portion of all shipments of radioactive      materials each year. For these shipments, packaging (classified as ""Type A"")      is used that is expected to withstand the rigors of normal transportation      without incurring any damage.      The packages for larger quantities of radioactive materials are designed      to withstand accident conditions without releasing their contents. These packages,      designated as ""Type B,"" are used for shipping industrial irradiators, medical      radiation therapy devices, and some radioactive wastes. The accident evaluation      criteria for these packages include impact, puncture, heat, and submersion      in water.      A specialized Type B package is the spent fuel shipping cask, which is used      to transport used fuel from nuclear reactors. These large shipping casks are      carried on trucks or rail cars. Like all Type B packages, they are sealed      to prevent leakage and heavily shielded to minimize the radiation levels.      The NRC also imposes security requirements on shipments of spent fuel and      on shipments of larger quantities of highly enriched uranium or plutonium.      These security measures include route evaluation, escort personnel and vehicles,      communications capabilities, and emergency plans.      State governments are notified in advance of spent fuel shipments and those      large-quantity shipments of radioactive waste requiring Type B packages.      The regulatory system for transportation of radioactive materials has been      successful in minimizing the safety impact from accidents involving the shipments.      Few accidents have occurred involving shipments of radioactive materials (averaging      less than 50 out of 3 million packages shipped annually). Only a small number      of those accidents have involved any release of the radioactive contents.      In these instances, radioactive contamination has been generally minor with      no public safety consequences.      DECOMMISSIONING      Decommissioning is the term used for ending the operation of a nuclear facility.      Nuclear power plants are licensed for a term of 40 years. Some plants may      be closed before that time elapses; others may seek an extension of the license      period.       Several nuclear power plants have been decommissioned, and some others are      undergoing decommissioning. The NRC has adopted extensive regulations for      dealing with the technical and financial issues associated with decommissioning.      These regulations apply to nuclear power plants and to other facilities      that handle radioactive materials in forms that may require cleanup procedures      when the facility is closed. Careful radiation surveys must also be performed      before the site can be released for other uses.      During the operating life of a nuclear power plant, many plant components      associated with the reactor become radioactive, either through contamination      or as a result of the radiation from the fission reaction. Therefore, care      is needed in the handling of decommissioning work, and contaminated materials      have to be shipped to a low-level radioactive waste disposal site for burial.      The NRC has identified two principal plans for decommissioning a nuclear      power plant -- immediate dismantling or safe storage for a period of 30 to      50 years followed by dismantling. A third option, called entombment, may also      be available in some cases. This would involve sealing off radioactive components      with concrete and steel. Entombment would require less maintenance and fewer      security provisions than the storage option.      The storage and entombment methods allow for a reduction in the levels of      radioactivity over time. NRC studies have shown that after 50 years, the volume      of radioactively contaminated material would be reduced to one-tenth of the      original volume as a result of radioactive decay. Delay in dismantling a plant      would also result in lower radiation exposures to the workers involved.      Cost estimates for decommissioning a large nuclear plant are $300 million      or more, plus the cost of demolition of non-contaminated materials. The NRC      decommissioning rules require utilities to establish funds to pay for the      future decommissioning of their plants.      Similar financial procedures are also required for other types of nuclear      facilities, including plants that prepare fuel for nuclear power plants or      process radioactive materials.      Some facilities that previously used nuclear materials in processing or      manufacturing activities require special management attention to ensure proper      remediation. The NRC developed a Site Decommissioning Management Plan to compel      timely cleanup of certain unusual and difficult sites, particularly those      with a lot of soil contamination or with old, contaminated buildings. Remediation      can usually be completed in four years. Afterwards, the site can be used safely      for any purpose.

Reference         ""The Harnessed Atom,"" Teacher's Edition, U.S. Department of          Energy.         Top           Lesson Plan         Greeting...         Increasingly, our country has become a nation of electricity users. We          depend on an abundant affordable supply of energy to power the many machines          we use in our complex society. Can you imagine what it would be like not          having electricity in your home? About one-third of our energy resources          are used to produce electricity.         Electricity can be produced in many ways -- most of which you already          know about. Today, we're going to talk about one of those ways -- nuclear          fission. In America, nuclear energy plants are the second largest source          of electricity after coal -producing approximately 21 percent of our electricity.          There is something I want all of you to be aware of and that is the purpose          of a nuclear power plant is to produce electricity.         Accordingly, while nuclear power plants have many similarities to other          types of electricity generating plants, there are some significant differences.         With the exception of solar, wind, and hydroelectric plants all others          including nuclear convert water to steam which spins the propeller like          blades of a turbine which spins the shaft of a generator. Inside the generator          coils of wire and magnetic fields interact to create electricity.           [ Turbine/Generator ]         The energy needed to boil water into steam is produced in one of two          ways -- by burning coal, oil, or gas (fossil fuels) in a furnace or by          splitting certain          atoms of uranium in a nuclear energy plant. Nothing is burned or exploded          in a nuclear energy plant. Rather, the uranium fuel generates heat through          a process called fission.         What Is Fission? Where Does it Take Place?         Uranium is an element that can be found in the crust of the earth. This          element, quite abundant in many areas of the world, is naturally radioactive.          Certain isotopes of uranium can be used as fuel in a nuclear power plant.          The uranium is formed into ceramic pellets about the size of the end of          your finger.  [ Reactor          Fuel Assembly ]  These pellets are inserted into long, vertical          tubes (fuel rods) within the reactor. The reactor is the heart of the          nuclear power plant. Basically, it is a machine that heats water.         A reactor has four main parts: 1) the uranium fuel assemblies, 2) the          control rods, 3) the coolant/moderator, and 4) the pressure vessel. The          fuel assemblies, control rods, and coolant/moderator make up what is known          as the reactor core. The core is surrounded by the pressure vessel.             [ Franklin's          Core ]         We also have to understand that uranium cannot just be thrown into a          reactor the way we shovel coal into a furnace. The fuel rods, containing          the uranium, are carefully bound together into fuel assemblies, each of          which contains about 240 rods. The assemblies hold the rods apart so that          when they are submerged into the reactor core, water can flow between          them.         When the uranium atom splits, it releases energy and two          or more neutrons from its nucleus. These neutrons can then hit the nuclei          of other uranium atoms causing them to fission. The sequence of one fission          triggering others, and those triggering still more, is called a chain          reaction. When the atoms split, they release energy in the form of heat.           [ Chain reaction ]  The heat is          transferred from the reactor core to the steam generator. Here, it's converted          to high pressure steam which turns the turbine in the electric generator.          [ Turbine/Generator ]         This next transparency shows the basic design of the nuclear          fuel steam plant and its various components. [ Nuclear          Power Plant ]         In the past few minutes I've introduced several new terms.          Let me explain what each means in the energy generating process. First,          control rods. What are they? How are they used?         The control rods slide up and down in between the fuel assemblies          in the reactor core. They control or regulate the speed of the nuclear          reaction by absorbing neutrons. Here's how it works. When the control          rods absorb neutrons, fewer neutrons hit the uranium atoms thus slowing          down the chain reaction.         On the other hand, when the core temperature goes down,          the control rods are slowly lifted out of the core, and fewer neutrons          are absorbed. Therefore, more neutrons are available to cause fission.          This releases more heat energy.         Just as there are many different types of houses and cars,          there are different types of nuclear power plants that generate electricity.          The two basic types being used in the United States are the  Boiling          Water Reactor (BWR)  and the  Pressurized          Water Reactor (PWR) . These power plants are often referred to as light          water reactors.         Top         [Pass out Activities          4 -   Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)            & 5 -   Pressurized Water          Reactor (PWR)   -- Students can label components of each type          reactor during the discussion]           Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)         The boiling water reactor operates in essentially the same          way as a fossil-fuel generating plant. Neither of these types of power          plants have a steam generator. Instead, water in the BWR boils inside          the pressure vessel and the steam water mixture is produced when very          pure water (reactor coolant) moves upward through the core absorbing heat.          The water boils and produces steam. When the steam rises to the top of          the pressure vessel, water droplets are removed, the steam is sent to          the turbine generator to turn the turbine. [ BWR          schematic ]         Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)         The pressurized water reactor differs from the BWR in that          the steam to run the turbine is produced in a steam generator. Water boils          at 212°F or 100°C. If a lid is tightly placed over a pot of boiling          water (a pressure cooker), the pressure inside the pot will increase because          the steam cannot escape. As the pressure increases, so does the temperature          of the water in the pot. In the PWR plant, a pressurizer unit keeps the          water that is flowing through the reactor vessel under very high pressure          to prevent it from boiling. The hot water then flows into the steam generator          where it is converted to steam. The steam passes through the turbine which          produces electricity. About two thirds of the reactor power plants in          the U.S. are of the PWR type.

Criteria for including reactors          are: 1) participation in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's certification          or pre-certification programs or 2) inclusion under the international          Generation IV International Forum (GIF) program for longer-term reactor          development. The U.S. Department of Energy is among the sponsors of the          GIF program. While no detailed technical description of particular reactor          designs is included, such descriptions and schematics are available elsewhere          and, when practical, are hyperlinked in the text. Reactor vendors who          put forward new designs anticipate that their designs will meet commercial          market needs including an affordable, competitive construction cost and          the usually low operating costs of commercial nuclear reactors. Such views          are not assessed, though a section does identify public discussion of          efforts by the nuclear industry and the U.S. government to improve the          industry's competitive position. 1                           Existing          Reactor Designs and Design Categories            There are now 104 fully licensed          nuclear power reactors in the United States though only 103 are now operational. 2           Because each of these reactors is fully licensed and meets national safety          standards, a potential builder might replicate any of these designs for          future construction. This is less likely, however, because existing, operable          reactors in the United States were licensed during or before the 1970s.          Technology has progressed and any future construction should incorporate          more advanced designs that better meet today's commercial criteria.         There are four possible exceptions          to the preceding statement. Four reactors in the United States were partially          built and still possess valid construction licenses. These reactors are          WNP-1 (Washington State), Watt's Bar 2 (Tennessee), and Bellefonte 1 and          2 (Atlanta). Moreover, these four construction licenses have recently          been extended to approximately the end of the present decade. Construction          on each unit was halted over a decade and a half ago. Builders of these          units, subject to the rules of their licenses, have the right to resume          construction on their reactors, units that were designed during the 1970s          or earlier. Whether the construction will resume and whether former designs          will be continued remains to be determined.         All existing commercial nuclear          reactors in the United States fall into two broad categories, pressurized          water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR). Because both types          of reactors are cooled and moderated 3           with ordinary ""light"" water, the two designs are often grouped          collectively as light water reactors (LWR). LWRs generate power through          steam turbines similar to those used for most power generated by burning          coal or fuel oil. Light water reactors have so far proven to be the most          commercially popular reactor design worldwide though there are notable          exceptions. 4           There are several available websites that discuss existing reactors in          the United States. These include  http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/reactsum.html .          Information on international operating reactors is available at  http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2 .         PWRs use nuclear-fission to          heat water under pressure within the reactor. This water is then sent          to a heat exchanger (called a ""steam generator"" in PWRs) where          steam is produced to drive an electric generator. The water used as a          coolant in the reactor and the water used to provide steam to the electric          turbines exists in separate closed loops that involve no discharges to          the environment. Of the 104 operable reactors in the United States, 69          are PWRs. Westinghouse, Babcock and Wilcox, and Combustion Engineering          designed the units operating in the U.S. After these reactors were built,          Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering nuclear assets were combined with          British Nuclear Fuels Limited to form Westinghouse BNFL. The French-German          firm Framatome ANP has acquired many of Babcock and Wilcox's nuclear technology          rights, though portions of the original Babcock and Wilcox firm still          exist and also possess some technology rights as well. Other major makers          of PWR reactors including Framatome ANP and the Russian Atomstroyexport          have not yet sold their reactors in the U.S. A schematic diagram of a          PWR can be found at           http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/pwr.html .         The remaining 35 operable          commercial nuclear reactors in the United States are BWRs. BWRs allow          heat from the reactor core to boil the coolant water directly into the          steam (i.e. no heat transfer) that is used to generate electricity. General          Electric built all boiling water reactors now operational in the United          States. Framatome ANP and Westinghouse BNFL have each designed BWRs though          these have not yet been sold in the United States. A schematic diagram          of a BWR can be found at  http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/bwr.html .         Although no LWR projects have          been initiated in the United States since the 1970s, the overall performance          record of the existing fleet has been reasonably successful. Some 111          LWRs have entered service in the U.S. since 1969. 5           Only seven of those since 1969 have been permanently shut down. The average          annual capacity factor for nuclear reactors in the United States was over          90 percent in 2002. Average operating costs, as reported by the Federal          Energy Regulatory Commission, are slightly lower for LWRs than for operating          coal-fired plants and considerably below operating costs for gas-fired          plants. 6         There have been attempts to          operate additional classes of reactors in the United States, though most          examples were prototypes and were not commercial successes. Perhaps the          most famous example was the Fort Saint Vrain reactor that operated between          1974 and 1989. It was a high temperature gas-cooled reactor or HTGR. Other          HTGRs operated elsewhere notably in Germany. HTGRs, of which there are          many sub-categories, continue to stimulate interest with small prototypes          now operating in China and Japan and additional HTGR designs promoted          by firms in South Africa, the United States, the Netherlands, and France.          HTGRs use a gas- recently helium has been preferred- to generate electricity.          In some cases the turbine is run directly by the gas, in other cases steam          or alternative hot gases are produced in a heat exchanger to generate          the power. HTGRs are distinguished from other gas-cooled reactors by the          higher temperatures attained within the reactor. Such higher temperatures          might permit the reactor to be used as an industrial heat source in addition          to generating electricity. Advocates of HTGR designs hold that HTGR's          have high safety, low costs, and an ability to supply power to smaller          markets .         Commercial reactor designs          that operate outside of the United States include fast breeder reactors          (FBRs), pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), and gas-cooled reactors          (GCRs). FBRs have received only very limited market support, though ""commercial""          units operate in Russia and France, and prototypes exist in other areas,          notably Japan and India. ""Breeder"" or ""fast"" reactors          have advantages because U-235 is the only naturally occurring uranium          isotope that is directly suitable for commercial energy production. U-235          is only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. 7           Most of natural uranium is the U-238 isotope that is not directly usable          as a reactor fuel. During the course of any reactor operation a portion          of the U-238 in the fuel is converted to plutonium, primarily the useful          Pu-239 isotope, which provides much of the energy used in nuclear power          production. The bulk of the U-238 content in an LWR is not converted to          plutonium and the unconverted U-238 does not contribute significantly          to power generation. A breeder reactor converts more U-238 to usable fuels          than the reactor consumes, though any unused fuel would have to be ""reprocessed""          before some of the plutonium and the remaining U-238 would again be usable.          FBRs have, so far, proven to be more expensive to build and operate than          LWRs. It is not yet clear whether this is due to the fact that most FBRs          have been prototypes or if this reflects underlying costs. The plutonium          content of the reprocessed fuel also raises concerns over weapons proliferation.          Many early FBR designs were prone to system failures, though same, notably          the BN-600 unit in Russia, have operated over extended periods. Proponents          of advanced reactor designs believe that some commercial FBR designs could          be deployed prior to most other advanced, but untested commercial designs. 8         PHWRs have been promoted primarily        in Canada and India, with additional commercial operating units in several        other nations including South Korea, China, Romania, and Argentina. Canadian        designed PHWRs are often called ""CANDU"" reactors. 9         Siemens, ABB, and Indian firms have also built commercial PHWR reactors.        Commercial heavy water reactors now in operation use heavy water as moderators        and coolants. No successful effort has been made to license PHWRs in the        United States. PHWRs have proven to be popular in several countries because        they usually use less expensive natural (not enriched) uranium fuels and        can be built and operated at competitive costs. PHWRs have often been preferred        by nations wishing to develop an indigenous fuel cycle without expensive        enrichment facilities. Proliferation issues related to the continuous process        of refueling PHWRs have raised some concerns . 10          The term gas-cooled reactor          (GCR) can be used ambiguously . HTGRs, for example, are clearly a subset          of GCRs that operate at higher temperatures. As used here, GCRs are ""Magnox""          reactors designed and built in the United Kingdom since the 1950s and          the derivative, advanced gas-cooled reactor (ACR), also operated in the          United Kingdom. Similar reactors have been built in France, Sweden, and          Japan. No traditional GCR design has operated commercially in the United          States. Existing GCR designs have not been commercially successful outside          of the United Kingdom. Commercial GCRs 11           in the United Kingdom have operated longer than commercial reactors anywhere          else in the world. Like the PHWRs, the original GCR designs use natural          uranium fuels, though newer designs use slightly enriched fuels and are          not confined to uranium.  12         Other potential designs for          commercial reactors abound. They have not been widely considered in recent          history in the United States. There is some experience with additional          concepts elsewhere.                     N ew          Designs            1. Certified          Designs         Following statutory requirements,          the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has set up a process by which          reactor designs might be certified prior to any actual construction plans.          The certification process seeks to reduce site development time by resolving          common design issues prior to construction. Design certification is an          optional process and may occur simultaneously with site licensing.

Any new reactor built in the          United States over the next decade or so would probably use designs either          recently certified by the NRC or that will be certified by the NRC in          the near future. The re-creation of older designs is popular overseas          and cannot be ruled out in the United States. Presently there are three          certified new reactor designs in the United States: the System 80+, the          Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR), and the AP600. These designs are          sometimes called Advanced Light Water Reactors (ALWR) because they incorporate          more advanced safety concepts than the reactors previously offered by          vendors.                   System 80+  (Westinghouse BNFL): The System 80+ reactor          is a PWR that was designed by Combustion Engineering and by its successor          owners ABB and Westinghouse BNFL. The NRC has certified the System 80+          for the U.S. market, at Westinghouse BNFL no longer actively promotes          the design for domestic sale. The System 80+ has provided the basis for          the APR1400 that has been developed in Korea for future deployment. Information          on the System 80+ reactor can be found on  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=703           and  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/sys80/sys80.html .                            ABWR  (General Electric, Toshiba, Hitachi): Of the three          NRC- certified ALWR designs only the ABWR has been deployed. Two ABWRs          are operating in Japan, and four are under construction, two each in Taiwan          and Japan. While the ABWR design is usually associated in the United States          with General Electric, the two units now being built in Japan are products          of Toshiba and Hitachi. General Electric, Toshiba, and Hitachi have shown          an interest in building ABWRs in the U.S. There are many variations in          ABWR design with the most frequently mentioned capacities in the 1250-1500          MWe range. Smaller and larger designs exist depending on vendor. Vendors          now claim costs for the ABWR that have attracted some customer interest.          Information on the ABWR can be found at  http://www.nei.org/doc.asp?docid=110 ,           http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/abwr/abwr.html ,          and  http://www.gepower.com/dhtml/corporate/en_us/assets/nuclear/prod/abwr_power_plant.jsp/ .                            AP600  (Westinghouse BNFL): The AP600 is a PWR designed          by Westinghouse BNFL and certified by the NRC. The AP600, while based          on previous reactor designs, has innovative passive safety features that          permit a greatly simplified reactor design. The AP600 has been bid overseas          but has never been built. Westinghouse has recently de-emphasized the          AP600 in favor of the larger, though potentially less expensive AP1000          design. Information on the AP600 can be found at  http://www.ap600.westinghouse.com/           and at  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=704 .                  The initial ALWR reactors          as a group have been praised for their improvements in reactor safety          and simplicity, but construction costs on a per kilowatt of capacity basis          might be a barrier to commercial success in the U.S. The ABWR design however          has many variations and continues to be promoted in the U.S. by several          vendors.         2. Undergoing          Certification         Only one reactor design is          presently undergoing certification with the NRC, although this situation          could change shortly as additional designs move from ""pre-certification""          to actual ""certification"". The process of certification can          take several years, and depends heavily on what design is proposed and          supported by potential vendors and buyers.                 AP1000  (Westinghouse BNFL): Quite often when a reactor          is named, its name includes digits such as the ""1000"" in the          AP1000. This usually indicates the initial electricity generating capacity          of the design, in this case 1000 MWe. Seldom do do the digits mean the          present capacity of the design. The most recent AP1000 now has 1117 MWe          capacity. The AP1000 is an enlargement of the initial AP600, designed          to increase the reactor's target output by over 80 percent without significantly          increasing the total cost of building the reactor. Operating costs are          anticipated to be less than the AP600. While Westinghouse BNFL owns rights          to several other designs, the AP1000 is the principal product that the          company now promotes in the United States. The AP1000 is a PWR with innovative,          passive safety features and a much simplified design that is intended          to cut the material and construction costs of the plant. Information on          the AP1000 can be found at  http://www.ap1000.westinghouse.com/           and at  http://www.nei.org/doc.asp?docid=770 .          Information related to NRC certification for the AP1000 can be found at           http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/ap1000.html .                          3. Undergoing          Pre-Certification            While pre-certification is          a technical concept within the NRC regulatory environment, the process          can mean many things to potential reactor manufacturers. Concepts such          as the ESBWR, the SWR-1000, and the ACR-700 appear to be much further          along toward potential deployment than, say, the IRIS and GT-MHR designs. 13           Pre-certification, however, represents a vendor's intention to proceed          toward commercialization in the U.S. and perhaps globally. Pre-certification          is a less expensive stage of the overall certification process, because          actual certification procedures are much more complex.                  ESBWR  (General Electric): The ESBWR 14           is a new simplified BWR design being promoted by General Electric. It          constitutes an evolution and merging of several earlier design ideas including          the ABWR and some other designs that are no longer being actively pursued          by GE. The intent of the new design, which includes new passive safety          features, is to cut construction and operating costs significantly from          the ABWR design. GE is investing heavily in the ESBWR though the design          might not be available for deployment for several years. Information related          to certification of the ESBWR can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/esbwr.html .                          Siedewasser Reaktor             (SWR-1000) (Framatome ANP): The SWR-1000   is          a Framatome ANP design for an advanced BWR. Framatome ANP was created          through the merger of the French nuclear vendor Framatome and the nuclear          power assets of the German firm Siemens. The SWR-1000 was originally designed          by Siemens and has been bid for a proposed reactor in Finland. Framatome          ANP has also recently begun SWR-1000 pre-certification with the NRC. Literature          on the design emphasizes the reactor's passive safety features. Information          on the SWR1000 can be found on  http://www.de.framatome-anp.com/anp/e/foa/anp/products/s112.htm .          Information related to certification of the SWR-1000 can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/swr-1000.html .                   ACR-700  (Atomic          Energy of Canada Limited): AECL's ""Advanced CANDU Reactor"" ACR-700 15           has been developed over a lengthy period of time and is considered an          evolution from AECL's internationally successful CANDU line of PHWRs.          CANDU reactors have been more of a commercial success than any other line          of power reactors other than the LWRs. One of the innovations in the ACR-700,          compared to earlier CANDU designs, is that heavy water is used only as          a moderator in the reactor. Light water is used as the coolant. Earlier          CANDU designs used heavy water both as a moderator and as a coolant. This          change makes it debatable whether the ACR-700 is a PHWR, a PWR, or a hybrid          between the two designs. This AECL has aggressively marketed the ACR-700          offering low prices, short construction periods, and favorable financial          terms. As is the case for most non-LWR reactors, most U.S. utilities,          nuclear engineers, and regulators have only limited working familiarity          with the design. Information on the ACR-700 can be found on  http://www.aecltechnologies.com/Content/ACR/default.htm            and  http://www.aecl.ca/index.asp .          Information related to certification of the ACR-700 can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/acr-700.html .                  P ebble-bed Modular          Reactor      (PBMR) (Eskom): The PBMR, which uses helium          for heat transfer, is part of the HTGR family of reactors and thus a product          of a lengthy history of research, notably in Germany, but has been promoted          by the South African utility Eskom. Eskom continues to partner in the          design with BNFL and formerly included the U.S. utility Exelon among its          investors. Exelon later pulled out of the project, primarily because it          felt that reactor development was not part of its main business activities.          This led to delays in the NRC certification process. Recently Eskom has          received approval to build a prototype PBMR in South Africa. Certification          procedures in the U.S. were never abandoned although the process has slowed.          At around 165 MWe the PBMR is one of the smallest reactors now being proposed          for the market. This is considered a marketing advantage because new small          units require less capital investments than larger new units. Small size          has been viewed as a regulatory disadvantage because most licensing regulations          (at least formerly) required separate licenses for each unit at a site.          If each PBMR module at a site were licensed separately, more regulatory          activity would be required. Fuels used in the PBMR would be more highly          enriched uranium than is presently used in LWR designs. Details regarding          the PBMR design can be found on  http://www.pbmr.com/ .          Information related to certification of the PBMR can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/pbmr.html .                   G as-turbine          Modular Helium Reactor   (GT-MHR)           (General Atomic): The GT-MHR is an HTGR design that has been developed          primarily under the lead of the U.S. firm, General Atomics. The most advanced          plans for GT-MHR development relate to building reactors in Russia to          assist in the ""burn up"" of surplus plutonium supplies. Parallel          plans for commercial power reactors would use uranium based-fuels enriched          to as high as 19.9 percent U-235 content. This would keep the fuel below          the 20 percent enrichment level that defines highly enriched uranium.          In initial designs, the conversion of the energy in the heated helium          coolant to electricity would be directly in a gas turbine. There has been          concern regarding untested aspects of this technology as it applies to          the GT-MHR. This has led some potential sponsors to propose less risky          heat transfer mechanisms to generate electricity. The U.S. utility, Entergy,          has participated in GT-MHR development and has used the name ""Freedom          Reactor"" for the design. Because coolant temperatures arising from          HTGR reactors are much higher than from LWRs the design is viewed as a          potential commercial heat source. There has been particular attention          to the design's potential in a non-polluting method to produce hydrogen.

Information related to certification of          the GT-MHR can be found at           http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/gt-mhr.html .                   International          Reactor Innovative & Secure  (IRIS) (Westinghouse BNFL):          Westinghouse BNFL has promoted the  IRIS           reactor design as a significant simplification and innovation in          PWR design. The reactor would be smaller than most operating PWRs and          would be much simplified. The IRIS reactor includes features designs that          are intended to avoid loss of coolant accidents. Research has continued          for some time on the design and pre-certification is in process. The IRIS          is viewed as not ready for development during the present decade, but          may show potential during the next decade. IRIS has a targeted 2015 completion          date. Information on the IRIS can be found on  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=712           and through  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/new-licensing-files/ml030780800.pdf .          Information related to certification of the IRIS can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/iris.html .                              4. Anticipated            for Possible Pre-Certification           Two designs, the European            Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR) and the ACR-1000, have not been submitted            for pre-certification in the United States. Because of the attention            that the designs are now receiving, they are described below.                     EPR  (Framatome ANP): Framatome ANP has not decided            if it will market its EPR in the United States. The EPR is a rather            conventional PWR unit though components have been simplified and considerable            emphasis is put on reactor safety. The design was bid on a project in            Finland during 2003. Additionally, the French utility Electricite de            France (EdF) has proposed building an EPR at Penly in France. The French            government is now determining whether to build this prototype. Nuclear            power already constitutes over 75 percent of France's power supply;            therefore building a new reactor in France might lead to decommissioning            an existing reactor to make room in the market for the base load power            provided by an EPR. Not building a prototype might affect the eventual            long-term marketability of the EPR. The proposed size of the reactor            would be around 1500 MWe though earlier designs were as large as 1750            MWe.                       ACR-1000  (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited): While AECL            is promoting its ACR-700 design, an ACR-1000 is being designed as well.            If the scale economies attributed by Westinghouse BNFL to its AP series            and to GE's ABWR are valid, one might anticipate parallel, cost-lowering            results for the ACR series. Advertised costs for the ACR-700 are already            as low as any design proposed for the near term. Promised construction            times of three years would set modern records for larger reactors. Information            on the ACR-1000 can be found on  http://www.aecl.ca/index.asp .             5. Generation            IV Concepts                       The U.S. Department of Energy            participates in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), an association            of ten nations that seek to develop a new generation of commercial nuclear            reactor designs before 2030. Criteria for inclusion of a reactor design            for consideration by the GIF group include:                  1.          Sustainable energy (extended fuel availability, positive environmental          impact)                 2. Competitive energy (low costs,          short construction times)                 3. Safe and reliable systems          (inherent safety features, public confidence in nuclear energy safety)                 4. Proliferation resistance          (does not add unduly to unsecured nuclear material) and physical            protection;          (secure from terrorist attacks)            During 2002, GIF members            agreed to concentrate their efforts and funds on six concept designs            that they seek to become commercially viable between 2015 and 2025.            There is thus some leeway between the 2030 target for the GIF program            and the targets for individual concepts. Individual GIF participant            nations are free to pursue any technology they chose, therefore not            all concepts are goals for the United States.            The GIF group, along with            the U.S. Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee            (NERAC), has published ""A Technological Roadmap for Generation            IV Nuclear Energy Systems"" (December 2002) which summarizes plans            and designs for Generation IV projects. This is accessible through  http://www.nuclear.gov/             and describes each design in some detail including reactor schematics.            Each design is evolutionary; thus while the following descriptions involve            comparisons, these analogies should be interpreted with caution.                                 Gas-cooled Fast Reactor  (GFR): The GFR uses helium            coolant directly to a gas turbine generator to produce electricity.            This parallels PBMR and original GT-MHR designs. The primary difference            from these designs is that the GFR would be a ""fast"", or breeder            reactor. One favored aspect of the design is that it would minimize            the production of many undesirable spent fuel waste streams. The reference            design size is targeted to be 288 MWe with a deployment target date            of 2025. In addition to producing electricity the design might be used            as a process heat source in the production of hydrogen.                                Lead-cooled Fast Reactor  (LFR): So far, most breeder            reactors have used molten metal technologies for their coolants. Many            FBRs have used molten sodium, a metal with which there is considerable            experience but which has sometimes been difficult to handle.The            LFR uses molten lead or a lead-bismuth alloy as its coolant. One design            favored in the Generation IV would result in long periods between refuelings,            15-20 years. Similar designs have been investigated in Russia. Target            ranges for the reactor would be 50-150 MWe. That would be rather small            by historic nuclear standards, but might meet localized market needs.            Designs as large as 1200 MWe have been suggested. Initial targeted deployment            would be in 2025. Proposed designs would favor electricity production            though proponents consider the production of process heat at LFR units            as possible. One design in this family of reactors is described on  http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/1002/reactor.html .                       Molten Salt Reactor  (MSR): The MSR involves a circulating            liquid of sodium, zirconium, and uranium fluorides as a reactor fuel.            The MSR has been presented as providing a comparatively thorough fuel            burn, safe operation, and proliferation resistance. The initial reference            design would be 1000 MWe with a deployment target date of 2025. The            design could use a wide variety of fuel cycles. Temperatures for electricity            production would not be as hot as for some other advanced reactors but            some process heat potential exists. Versions of the MSR have been around            for some time but never were implemented for commercial uses. During            2003, the MSR was removed from the Gen IV program because it was seen            as too distant into the future for inclusion within the  Gen            IV schedule.                               Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor  (SFR): Sodium-cooled fast            reactors have been the most popular design for breeder reactors. Designs            have been proposed under the ""Technological Roadmap"" ranging            from 150 to 1700 MWe. Molten metal technology is no longer ""new""            but several early SFR prototypes had difficulty obtaining sustained            operation. The BN-600 in Russia has been regarded as highly reliable.            Design supporters believe that the SFR promises superior fuel management            characteristics. The target deployment date of 2015 reflects the considerable            research that the design has already received. Earlier prototypes have            already been built in France, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia,            and the United States since as early as 1951. Initial deployment would            probably focus on electricity due to comparatively low ""outlet            temperatures"" for the design. Sodium cooled reactors are discussed            at  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/~gav/almr/01.intro.html .                                Supercritical-water-cooled Reactor  (SCWR): The SCWR            design is to be the next step in LWR development and has been proposed            with alternatives that evolve from the BWR and PWR. SCWRs would operate            at higher temperatures and thermal efficiencies than present LWRs. The            reference plant would be 1700 MWe, above the upper end of present LWR            designs. The deployment target date is 2025. Most research on the design            has been in Japan. Designers intend the SCWR to be much less expensive            to build than today's LWR units though some of the economies appear            to be shared by units now undergoing certification. Operating cost savings            are also anticipated.                      Very-high-temperature Reactor  (VHTR): The VHTR is an            evolution from the HTGR family of reactors but would operate at even            higher temperatures than designs now undergoing pre-certification. In            contrast with the GFR, the VHTR would not be a breeder reactor, thus            it would produce less potentially usable fuel than it consumes. In addition            to generating electricity, the design would provide process heat that            could be used in industrial activities including hydrogen production            and desalinization. Electricity generation targets have not yet been            set. Deployment is targeted for 2020, earlier than all but one Generation            IV design. This reflects earlier experience with parallel designs. Electricity            generation would involve a heat exchanger rather than direct processing            through a turbine. A VHTR is discussed at  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/mhtgr/mhtgr.html .              Each GIF project involves            new or untested concepts in reactor design. It would be surprising if            every design concept met the program's initial targets. The research            involved in the program has the potential to contribute to the understanding            of alternative types of commercial nuclear power and process heat even            if individual projects do not meet expectations .                     6. Outlook                      Efficiency            Issues             A primary source of doubt            regarding the potential of nuclear power, at least in the U.S., has            been whether the recent technology has been too expensive to compete            in the commercial marketplace. There have been relatively few orders            for new nuclear power plants during the last two decades, not just in            the United States and Canada, but also in Western Europe (outside of            France). Interest in new nuclear power units has recently focused on            Asia and to a lesser extent in Eastern Europe. Reactor vendors have            not ignored the message that their product has recently involved high            construction costs and long construction periods. Vendors are attempting            to position their product with promises of lower prices, shorter construction            times, and specified financial arrangements. Most competitors are now            offering fixed and historically low prices for their designs, though            such prices are often confined to those parts of construction that the            vendors actually control, the ""nuclear island"" that they designed.           Concerns regarding construction            costs for new nuclear power plants contrast sharply with the comparatively            low cost of operating commercial reactor designs. Overall operating            costs for nuclear power plants, as reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory            Commission (FERC), have been roughly the same as and more recently slightly            less than operating costs for coal-fired plants for about two decades.            Such operating costs are considerably below the costs of operating a            gas-fired generation unit. Moreover, the fuel cost component of operating            a nuclear power plant is particularly low. This operating cost advantage            has given existing nuclear power units a favored position in the provision            of base load electric power. Nuclear plant designers hope to take advantage            of such low operating costs in positioning their new designs. Estimates            of the capital and operating cost of new power generation units can            be found on Figure 70 and Table 8 of the  Annual            Energy Outlook .           The following publications            summarize efforts and procedures to make new nuclear power plants commercially            attractive.                                   ""Strategies for competitive nuclear power plants (TECDOC-1123)""              International Atomic Energy Agency  (November 1999), website:               http://www.iaea.org/worldatom            .             ""A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United              States by 2010,"" United States Department of Energy Office of              Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology and its Nuclear Energy Research              Advisory Committee Subcommittee on Generation IV Technology Planning              (October 31,  2001), website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                          Scully Capital, ""Final Draft, Business Case for Nuclear              Power Plants, Bringing Public and Private Resources Together for Nuclear              Energy"" (July 2002) (available through United States Department              of   Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology,              website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                         ""A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems              (GIF-002-00)"" U.S. DOE Nuclear  Energy Research Advisory              Committee and Generation IV International Forum (December  2002),               website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                                              Summary            and Potential           There are early signs that            the nature of the nuclear reactor market might be changing. Finland            is presently evaluating bids for a ""fifth nuclear reactor"".            Four bids were received from three vendors: General Electric (ABWR),            Framatome ANP (SWR-1000 and EPR), and Atomstroyexport (VVER-1000). This            is one of the few recent cases of truly competitive international bidding            for new reactor construction. There is no guarantee that the reactor            will actually be built until an order is issued and contracts are signed.           More recently Bulgaria has            discussed building a new nuclear reactor at Belene. Belene was originally            to be a Russian-designed VVER-1000 unit using equipment already owned            by and located in Bulgaria. More recently, competitive submissions from            several vendors for alternative, newer designs have been considered.            It is unclear if the original design plan for Belene will move forward            or if new designs will be slated.           The United States is funding            a program called Nuclear Power 2010 that seeks to build at least two            nuclear power reactors by 2010. Supporting this has been proposed Federal            energy legislation. Meeting the 2010 target would be a challenging task            and the proposed legislation is still being debated .             1 A            large number of reactor designs have been excluded from the discussion.            These include reactors promoted overseas by nations such as Russia,            India, Argentina, Korea, Canada, and China, as well as numerous smaller            or even portable reactors that are being examined worldwide, including            in the United States. Also excluded is the International Atomic Energy            Agency's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel            Programs (INPRO) that covers territory similar to the GIF program in            addition to other promising designs. GIF designs have been more heavily            promoted within the United States.              2 The            one that is not operational, Brown's Ferry 1, has been shut down since            1985, but has not given up its operating license. The plant's owner-operator,            the Tennessee Valley Authority, intends to restart the reactor in 2007.             3 The            terms ""cooled"" and ""moderated"" are important because            they define reactor categories. Cooling in a reactor refers to the process            and medium by which heat is transferred from the reactor core to the            steam supply cycle of the nuclear power plant. ""Moderating""            is a concept unique to nuclear power. A moderator controls the rate            of the nuclear power reaction and thus the amount of heat that is generated.            In a light water reactor ordinary water serves both functions. Light            water contains the same isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen as naturally            occurring water. Heavy water contains a different, heavier isotope of            hydrogen known as deuterium. Beyond the point that these conditions            define reactor types, this will not matter in the discussion of existing            reactors. It does matter for the group that will be discussed under            ""Generation 4"" reactors.             4 Exceptions            include Canada, the United Kingdom, India, and part of Russia's industry.             5             Prior to 1969, some smaller commercial reactors were placed in service.            All have been retired.             6             This is based on Utility Data Institute/Resource Data Internationl Compilations            of FERC Form 1 data.                 7 The            discussion here does not directly address ""enrichment"" the            process by which the U-235 content of nuclear fuel is increased .             8 This            latter statement is based on ""A Technology Roadmap for Generation            IV Nuclear Energy Systems"".             9 Canada            has an interesting and unique nuclear power history which is covered            by the book, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Canada Enters the            Nuclear Age.             10 Inspectors            of nuclear power plants have a preference for plants such as the LWRs            that are refueled in batches rather than the continuous fueling of PHWRs.            Batch refueling is more easily monitored and occurs at intervals of            one to two years.             11              Not the ACRs.             12             Most designs of PHWRs also use natural uranium fuels. However, variations            in fuel type are possible at any PHWR with plutonium and thorium fuel            content subject to particular interest and experimentation.             13             This sentence is a good example of the acronyms that overwhelm the nuclear            steam supply system (NSSS) industry. Several of these acronyms no longer            have any meaning in ""words"" while others have only limited            actual meaning. They are defined below when possible.             14             The term ESBWR has sometimes been identified with ""European Simplified            Boiling Water Reactor"". GE publicly denies that the initials have            any meaning.             15             ACR is usually read to mean ""Advanced CANDU Reactor"".

The structure of the bedding remains in some slate deposits as visible bands running across the cleavage. Known as ribbons, these bands may be either weaker or harder than the surrounding slate. Slate's durability as roofing is due to its high strength, low porosity and low absorption rate. Specific mineral components are responsible for the various colors: carbon (black), hematite (red and purple), chlorite and ferrous iron oxide (green). Other minerals, considered impurities (calcite and iron sulfides), are slowly transformed by weathering into gypsum, which expands and causes the slate to delaminate.  Quarrying Until the 1870s the quarrying of slate changed little from what is illustrated by Diderot in the Pictorial Encyclopedia of Science Art and Technology of 1762. Blocks were separated from the floor of the quarry using picks, wedges, prybars and gunpowder, taking maximum advantage of the natural seams in the rock. Windlasses and simple cranes employed man or horse power to lift blocks of slate from the pit. With the Industrial Revolution came mechanical drills and steam-powered stone channeling machines and hoists. Waste associated with blasting was reduced and efficiency increased. Subsequent advances were marked by the introduction of the wire saw in 1926 and the diamond belt saw in 1988.  Slate has been used as a roofing material in Europe for hundreds of years, with surviving examples dating to the 8th century. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, most of the roofing slate used in America was imported from North Wales, where slate quarrying was a major industry. Although the first commercial slate quarry in the United States was opened in 1785 in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania, the industry was limited and local until the second half of the 19th century. At that time the industry grew and matured in response to a growing population, advancements in quarrying technology, an expanding rail system, and the immigration of Welsh slate workers to America. The United States became a slate exporter after the Civil War, as quarries opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Architectural styles of this period emphasized prominent roof lines and decorative patterns, details that were well suited to the varied  Front elevation of a dwelling published in Supplement to Bicknell's Village Builder. A specification for one of the designs included this direction for the French roof: ""Slate the sides of the roof with slate 5 x 12 inches, cornered as shown on elevation, nailed with galvanized nails; all hips and valleys to be flashed with tin in the best manner.""

Properties such as nonflammability, durability, minimal maintenance costs, and aesthetic value made slate all the more desirable. Its primary drawback was its weight, making shipping costly and requiring substantial roof framing. The Vendor Slate Co. had ten quarries in Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York in 1929.

Later use of slate often employed different thicknesses and colors, and unevenly cut or aligned butts to produce picturesque effects suitable for English revival styles popular in the early 20th century. After 1915 widespread use of slate roofing declined in the United States, due in part to a lack of skilled labor, but more importantly, due to the development of modern, mass produced materials such as asphalt shingles, which seemed the more economical alternative. A slate is typically attached to wooden sheathing with two nails driven through prepunched holes, though as with tile, it may be wired or screwed to steel angles on a steel framed roof. At the end of the19th century asphalt saturated felt laid over the wood sheathing became a standard part of most slate roof installations. Slate is installed with an overlap that depends on the slope of the roof and requires a minimum pitch (generally 4 inches of rise per 12 inches of run) to effectively shed water. Particularly in coastal areas slate can be found laid in mortar, providing extra protection against wind driven rain.  ""Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that looks like slate is good slate."" claims the Bangor Slate Co. of Easton, Pennsylvania. They issued this certificate in 1906 emphasizing the source of slate as an indication of quality.
