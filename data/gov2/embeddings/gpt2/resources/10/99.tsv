Doris     was a home economics teacher and an at home mother who used and demonstrated functional, high-quality kitchen tools     and equipment. She found that the kitchen tools available in shops were not of the quality available to her as a     professional and some tools were not well designed. Doris also found that salespeople sometimes did not know a great     deal about kitchen products. From this the idea of designed quality and functional kitchen products and created the     company The Pampered Chef.                Doris wanted her products to be shown in homes around America, by housewives to their friends and family. Customers    would be able to see the products demonstrated, use them before purchase and then buy the items there and then. She    quickly achieved this with the help and support of her husband, Jay, and their two young daughters, Julie and Kelley.        Soon her homeware products were selling not only throughout the USA but worldwide, including    here in the United Kingdom. The UK distribution network started in 1999 and continues to grow in strength thanks     to hard working Pampered Chef Consultants who sell their high-quality kitchen tools. Over 55,000 Pampered Chef Consultants    work around the world including countries such as Germany, Britain, America and Canada. All Pampered Chef products    have at least a one year guarantee.         You can easily join The Pampered Chef and start earning money with hours to suit your family and social     needs .                 Items you can sell include baking cutters, tableware, oven mitts, cake tester, mixing bowls, rice cookers, stir fry skillets,    recipe cookbooks, peelers, whisks, serving sets, cookware, stoneware collections and much, much more. If you allow a Pampered    Chef Consultant to host a party, which is called a cooking show, in your home you can claim free items from their catalogue. This gives you a chance     to observe a trained employee (independent consultant) of Pampered Chef in action and to learn their selling skills first hand.  Consultants can also demonstrate the Pampered Chef multi purpose kitchen tools. In addition the consultant can show easy recipes that offer dramatic results and simple mealtime preparation techniques that make cooking quick, easy and fun!           Become An Independant Consultant with The Pampered Chef     Become an independent consultant in The Pampered Chef  and you will benefit from being your own boss: working hours to suit you, your family and social life. Other benefits include:        Earn Money     Free training and support     Free Pampered Chef products     Free award gifts such as holidays, sapphire and diamond jewellery for top sales achievers     Meeting new friends                Working for The Pampered Chef would suit a variety of people such as men or women with children who want a job    that is flexible around child care, retired people and those with a passion for cooking and being in the kitchen.     Pampered Chef work could be the opportunity you have been looking for, whether to supplement your existing income or to enable you to make a life changing career decision.    Income from The Pampered Chef should be declared to your Tax Office on your self assessment form. You may be able     to claim tax relief from expenses such as travelling, car mileage, telephone calls and the Pampered Chef start up kit.            The Pampered Chef Start Up Kit     You will need to buy The Pampered Chef start up kit, which is about 00, and includes stationery and business     materials for the shows. You are obligated to complete at least six shows in your first year. Expenses thereafter    are the catalogues and invitations, though these can go on your income tax expense sheet. There are no other hidden    charges or costs, though some Pampered Chef Consultants give out free food and drink to their customers and get a return    on this by seeing an increase in sales.

Pampered Chef Shows     Shows can be held in friends and family's homes, local pubs, clubs and village halls - use your local contacts    and build up a friendly fun rapport with your clients to keep them as spending customers. If people love your shows    and have a fun day or night out they will come back with more friends and family and your income will grow. Do pass    out business cards with your contact details so that people can easily contact you and book a Pampered Chef show.         You do not need to keep stock at home, other than the demonstration items - some sales Consultants even use these    in their own kitchens between shows. After you have taken the orders you place the order on-line and the products are shipped   directly to the host of the show so there are no deliveries to do.      There are few downsides to being a Pampered Chef Sales Consultant. The only thing I can think of is that you have    to overcome any fear of public speaking. However this can be fun and many people grow to love talking about the products    and having a laugh with groups of new friends - whilst earning money.

Perhaps the oldest oats grain was found in Egypt among remains of the 12th Dynasty, which was about 2000BC. The oldest known cultivated oats were found in cave in Switzerland that are believed belong to Bronze Age. They were the last of the major cereal grains to be domesticated, around 3,000 years ago in Europe,  Greeks and Romans considered oats to be nothing more than a diseased version of wheat. Oats were a lowly horse food for the Romans, who scoffed at the ""oat-eating barbarians"", or those pesky Germanic tribes who eventually toppled the West Roman Empire.     The history of oats is somewhat clouded because there are so many different species and subspecies, which makes identification of old remains very difficult. The chief modern center of greatest variety of form is in Asia Minor.   Oats were first brought to North America with other grains in 1602 and planted on the Elizabeth Islands off the coast of Massachusetts. As early as 1786, George Washington sowed 580 acres to oats. By the 1860s and 1870s, the westward shift of oat acreage in the United States had moved into the middle and upper Mississippi  Valley, which is its major area of production today.

But the man who gave the hamburger its contemporary look and sought to expand the products appeal through chain operations was J. Walter Anderson, a Wichita, Kan., resident who went on to co-found the White Castle Hamburger system, the oldest continuously running burger chain. However, there is a history that in late eighteenth century, the largest port in Europe was in Germany. Sailors who visited port brought special food called “Hamburg steak” as a popular usage. It was a hard slab of salted minced beef, often slightly smoked, mixed with onions and breadcrumbs. Immigrants arriving England at that time also bring new food with consist of chopped beef, suet, and spices. The other famous story is that Charlie Nagreen of Wisconsin, at age 15, sold hamburgers from his ox-drawn food stand at the Outagamie County Fair. He went to the Outagamie County Fair and set up a stand selling meatballs. Business wasn't good and he quickly realized that it was because meatballs were too difficult to eat while strolling around the fair. In a flash of innovation, he flattened the meatballs, placed them between two slices of bread and called his new creation a hamburger. He was known to many as ""Hamburger Charlie."" He returned to sell hamburgers at the fair every year until his death in 1951.

Wheat flour, believed to originate in the Middle East, serves as the basis of the first “noodles.” 300 The Chinese form whole grain paste into various noodle-like products. 500-600 Amidst numerous cultural exchanges, China shares Buddhism and the art of noodle-making with Japan. Buckwheat noodles become a staple of the Japanese tea ceremony. 1138 Arab geographer, Idrisi, travels to Sicily and writes about “triyah,” a food resembling threads and produced in large quantities. 1700 The very first spaghetti is produced in Napoli,  Italy. 1800 Japanese specialty shops create noodles, similar to those eaten today, but requiring considerable preparation time and effort. It is believed that noodles originated from China as early as 5000 BC, then spread to other Asian countries. Today, about 40% of the flour consumed in Asia is for Noodle manufacture. In recent years, noodles have also become very popular outside Asia and this popularity is likely to increase. The relationship between noodles and pasta also goes back more than 700 years. It is believed that in the late 13th century, Marco Polo traveled to China and brought noodles back to Italy to add to his country's repertoire of pasta.

That story is over 1000 years old so the history of coriander as an aphrodisiac dates back far into history. Coriander has been used as an “appetite” stimulant. Its dried seed produce a euphoric effect, especially in women. The seed of the well known Coriandrum sativum is known as coriander. The coriander is derived from the Greek word koris. It means bedbug. This due the unripe seeds and leaves when crushed has a smell suggestive of a crushed bedbug. Coriander is used in condiments, dessert, liqueurs perfumes and candies. Generally it thought to be from Mediterranean and parts of southwestern Europe. It is believed to be sued since 5,000 BC. Ancient Egyptians and Greeks believed coriander had aphrodisiacal properties.

Its use as a food and as medicinal stimulant is lost in history. The roasting of coffee beans to give the aroma and flavor, which is universally recognized and appreciated, started during the 13th century and the quality of the aromatic profile is still a matter of expertise in carrying out this process.  Coffee is a large evergreen shrub of which Coffee Arabica, L. and C.robusta, L. are the most important commercial species existing in many varieties. Several other species are encountered but these are of less importance; the flavor of these beans is generally considered to be less coarse, bitter and much less acceptable than that of C.arabica.

Of course, this statement is based largely upon imperfect records, perhaps, in many cases only hints more or less doubtful as to the various species. But it seems safe to conclude that a goodly number of the herbs discussed in this volume, especially those said to be natives of the Mediterranean region, overhung and perfumed the cradle of the human race in the Orient and marked the footsteps of our rude progenitors as they strode more and more sturdily toward the horizon of promise. This idea seems to gain support also from the fact that certain Eastern peoples, whom modern civilization declares to have uneducated tastes, still employ many herbs which have dropped by the wayside of progress, or like the caraway and the redoubtable ""pusley,"" an anciently popular pot herb, are but known in western lands as troublesome weeds.  Relying upon Biblical records alone, several herbs were highly esteemed prior to our era; in the gospels of Matthew and Luke reference is made to tithes of mint, anise, rue, cumin and other ""herbs""; and, more than 700 years previously, Isaiah speaks of the sowing and threshing of cumin which, since the same passage also speaks of ""fitches"" (vetches), wheat, barley and ""rie"" (rye), seems then to have been a valued crop.

Somehow it looked and tasted like lard. Its original name was discovered by the person name Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1813. It was in 1869  Louis Napoleon 111 offered special prize for anybody that can make a substitute for butter, which would suitably for use of army and lower class caste. Margarine naturally appears white due to forbidding of artificial coloring agents. Ban on coloration became common at that time around the world for nearly 100years. Post war and after great depression, margarine coloring restrictions were lifted.  Modern margarine producer has made a lot of changes. Modern margarine can be made from variety of animals or vegetable fats .

It is essentially a fat of milk. Butter is used as a spread and condiment, as well as in cooking applications. Butter started in Mesopotamian some where between 9000 and 8000 before century. At that time butter was made from sheep or goat’s milk. For ancient Greek and Rome butter is considered a food fit for barbarians. In Northern Europe, butter was also used to prevent kidney and bladder stones. The ancient dwellers of India relating to butter making, dating back to 1500-200BC when Hindus of that time gave young married couple a ‘bridal feast’ consisting of milk, honey and butter. Until the 19th century, majority of butter was made by hand. In 1860s, first butter appeared in United States. Now a days margarine is taken over butter consumption due to less expensive and perceived as being healthier.

It is named after the flightless Kiwi bird of New Zealand, although its origins are in Yangtze Valley of China. The original designation of Chinese gooseberry is also misleading, since it is not a true member of the gooseberry family. Kiwi fruits actually grow on woody vines, much like grapes. During the early 1900s, Isabel Fraser, a director of a New Zealand school visited China and became fascinated with the fruit known at the time as a Chinese gooseberry. She brought back several fruit-bearing vines for her gardener to cultivate. Eventually the fruit became so popular that commercial growers became interested. In order to establish an association with New Zealand, marketers changed the name to ""Kiwifruit"". Kiwi fruit actually get name from marketing strategy, kiwi, and the national bird of New Zealand.  In 1996, New Zealand Kiwi fruit industry re branded the kiwi fruit as Zespri.  In United States, commercial planting began late  1960s in California. From 50 acres in 1970, the industry in California had grown to more than 8,000 acres by1988.

Those who dwelt inland could enjoy fresh water fish such as salmon, trout, eel and pike. One of their ingenious inventions was the gorge – a baited sliver of bone attached to a line of leather or sinew. When a fish took the bait the gorge stuck in its throat and it was hauled in nets made from plant fibers or leather, have not survived, but the existence of small, grooved stones that could have been net weights suggest that nets were in use.  Fishers also invented the leister, a three pronged spear. A fish was impaled on the central straight prong and curved prongs on either side stopped it wriggling off.  In the spring the salmon raced upstream to spawn. This was a gastronomic bonanza for Cro-Magnons, as huge deposits of scales and bones found in some places confirm. Salmon could be speared as they struggle through the shallows, and the crafty Cro-Magnons may well have piled up stones to form a trap. The fish would swim through the funnel-like entrance into pool from which there was no exit, except on the prongs a leister. Much of the catch was then dried or smoked and stored.

However certain people believe that watermelon to have originated from desert  of Kalahari. The famous traveler name David Livingstone reported that saying, at that time there were a lot of watermelon field at that area. According to him, there was a lot of watermelon plant grow without anybody notice of it taste. Once many people know their healths benefit and have a very good taste, it became popular and the watermelon fields slowly expand to other countries of Africa. However, the first written history of watermelon, it comes from Egypt 5,000 years ago. Watermelons were often place in the burial tombs in order to nourish them afterlife. From Egypt watermelon spread to other countries along Sea of Mediterranean by way of trading ships.  Watermelon spread to Europe through Moors people at 13th century.

Probably the men did most of the hunting for the very practical reason that most adult women would have small children to care of – a crying baby would scare off the game before had even started. A band of hunters might sneak upon herd of reindeer, bison or horses, pick out a likely victim, run it down and spear it to death. However, a lot might go wrong with this approach. A slight change of wind or a tiny sound would betray the hunters’ present, and the herd would run. To get really close to large animal, particularly one with horn, was especially dangerous; approaching a wounded one was doubly so. The Cro-Magnons’ chances of success and safety were increased by invention of spear thrower and the bow and arrow. Both enabled the hunters to launch their attack from a greater and safer distance.

""Stay away from butter and switch to 'heart healthy' margarine , is what they told us.    But is that really true?    Does switching from butter to margarine lower cholesterol and reduce your risk of a heart attack?    The answer is a resounding NO.    It turns out  margarine is one of the worst things you can eat for your arteries and heart .  (The margarine vs. butter myth ranks right up there with the lies youve been told about   cholesterol and eggs .)    Let me say this as clearly as I can & natural foods are always better than artificial foods. Always.    Butter is a natural healthy fat, made from cream.  Margarine is an artificial concoction of chemicals.     Butter tastes better and it's better for you.     I wont go into the details of how margarine is made, because it might be close to mealtime  and I dont want you to lose your appetite.    But here are two key points you need to remember:    Hydrogenation is used in the making of margarine and  you never want to eat hydrognenated foods . (Oh, and dont be  misled into thinking that partially hydrogenated isnt as bad for you.  All hydrogenation is bad for you.)   They use  second-rate oils of low quality  - which is bad enough, but to make matters  worse  these oils (often already rancid) are heated to high temperatures during the manufacturing  process.  Heated oils may be THE worst food you can put inside your body .          Lets not forget about the addition of some not-so-down-home-goodness like emulsifiers,  synthetic vitamins and artificial flavors and colors. How anyone can call this stuff healthy is beyond me.    Run on over to your refrigerator and toss any margarine tubs in the trash right now.     Don't mess around with that artery clogging and cancer causing junk.     While you dont want to go overboard with extremely high amounts of butter in your  diet, be sure to use butter over margarine. Your taste buds and your heart will both thank you for it.
