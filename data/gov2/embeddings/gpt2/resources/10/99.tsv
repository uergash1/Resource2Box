GX009-19-11113699	"Brooklyn,            New York:           On            August 19, 1991, violence erupted in the Crown Heights Community of            Brooklyn after a car being driven as part of a security convoy struck            and killed an African-American male, age seven. In the ensuing violence,            a group of African-Americans attacked and stabbed Yankel Rosenbaum,            a visiting Hasidic scholar from Australia. Rosenbaum subsequently died            from the injuries he sustained.                         On August 27, 1991, Lemrick Nelson, an African-American male, age 16,            was charged locally with murdering Rosenbaum. On October 29, 1992, Nelson            was acquitted. Following the local acquittal, the Department of Justice            requested that the FBI conduct a federal civil rights investigation.            On August 11, 1994, Nelson was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and            charged with violation Title 18, U.S.C., Section 245. On August 7, 1996,            a second subject, Charles Price, was also indicted and charged with            violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 245. Price was observed at the scene            of the Rosenbaum attack inciting the crowd to violence. After four days            of deliberations, both subjects were found guilty on February 10, 1997,            of federal civil rights violations. On March 31, 1998, Nelson was sentenced            to 235 months in prison. On July 9, 1998, Price was sentenced to 260            months in prison.                           Los            Angeles, CA:                      On            October 3, 1996, FBI Los Angeles initiated an investigation at the request            of the Los Angeles Attorney's Office after local newspapers reported            an unidentified individual had sent threatening E-mail messages to 58            University of California at Irvine (UCI) students. The message blamed            Asian students for all the crimes that occurred on the UCI campus, and            the author wrote that he wanted Asians to leave UCI or he would hunt            them down and kill them. The writer was identified as Richard Machado,            a former UCI student.           A            summons was issued ordering him to appear before a federal magistrate            on November 25, 1996, in Santa Ana, California. Machado did not show            for initial appearance and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Machado's            former employer, roommates, and family members claimed to have no knowledge            of his whereabouts.           He            was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and on November 13, 1996, and a            Failure to Appear warrant was issued. Machado's whereabouts were unknown            until February 6, 1997 when he was arrested by United States Customs            Agents at Nogales, Arizona, while attempting to enter the United States            from Mexico.           Machado            was returned to the central district of California by United States            Marshal's on March 3, 1997. He was declared a flight risk by a U.S.            Magistrate Judge and ordered detained on March 5, 1997. Machado entered            a not guilty plea during his arraignment in Santa Ana, California, on            March 10, 1997.           On            November 13, 1996, Richard Machado, was indicted by a Federal Grand            Jury, and charged with ten counts of Interference with Federally Protected            Activities, 18 U.S.C., Section 245 (b) 2 (A). The trial began on November            4, 1997 with the defense and prosecution giving closing arguments on            November 18, 1997. After three days of deliberations, a jury could not            reach a verdict and U.S. District Judge Alicemarie Stotler declared            a mistrial. A hearing was held on December 1, 1997, to consider bail            reduction. The defendant was still considered a fight risk, and the            judge ordered him detained pending a new trial. A new trial date was            set for January 27, 1998.           During            the second trial, Machado was charged with two counts of Interfering            with Federally Protected Activities. That trial began on January 27,            1998. A guilty verdict was returned on one count February 10, 1998.            The jury failed to agree on a verdict pertaining to the second count.           On            September 24, 1998, Machado admitted to violating his probation requirements.            A U.S. District Judge sentenced him to four months in a halfway house            and eight months supervised probation.           On            May 4, 1998, Machado was sentenced to one year in jail and was given            credit for maximum time already served. Conditions for his supervised            release were submission to scheduled drug tests; counseling in racial            relations; no driver's license or passport applications without approval            from his probation officer; no trespassing on UCI campus and no contact            with recipients of the hate mail or witnesses in the trial.                                  Back            To Top                                                                                 Dallas, Texas:           On            April 26, 1997, Donald Ray Anderson drove his 1978 Cadillac into the            parking lot of the Baruch Ha Shem Synagogue. At the time, members of            the synagogue were present and participating in regular service. After            exiting his vehicle, Anderson, armed with an SKS rifle, walked to the            synagogue's courtyard. Upon entering the courtyard, Anderson was allegedly            heard to have yelled, ""I'm here to expose the Jewish conspiracy.""            He then aimed his gun toward a woman who was present in the courtyard.            Thereafter, he raised the gun and shot four to five times into the air.            Anderson then returned to the parking lot and shot numerous times at            the synagogue itself.                         On May 14, 1997, a Dallas, Texas, Grand Jury indicted Anderson on four            counts of aggravated assault and one count of deadly conduct. Although            he was indicted on state charges, a Federal Grand Jury indicted Anderson            on August 28, 1997, charging him with violation of two counts of Title            18, U.S.C., Section 247, and one count of Title 18, U.S.C., Section            924(c) (Use of a firearm while committing a crime of violence). Subsequently,            Anderson entered into a plea agreement with the government. On May 5,            1998, Anderson was sentenced to 27 months imprisonment for violating            Title 18, U.S.C., Section 247; and 120 months imprisonment for violating            Title 18, U.S.C., Section 924(c).                                  Back            To Top                                                                       Mobile,            Alabama:                        On            July 1, 1997, St. Joseph Baptist Church was discovered burned to the            ground. Shortly thereafter, Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church, located approximately            a quarter mile from St. Joseph Baptist Church and on the same rural            road, was discovered vandalized with evidence also present of an attempted            arson. A joint investigation by the local National Church Arson Task            Force was immediately initiated. St. Joseph Baptist Church and Tate            Chapel A.M.E. Church host African American congregations.                         On July 31, 1997, subjects Alan Odom, Michael Woods, Brandy Boone, and            Kenneth Cumbie were indicted in connection with the arson of St. Joseph            Baptist Church. A second count of the indictment charged Alan Odom and            Jeremy Boone with the attempted arson of the Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church.            On November 3, 1997, Alan Odom, Brandy Boone, and John Kenneth Cumbie            were found guilty of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 371 and Odom            was also found guilty of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 844(h)(1)            and 844(i) regarding the St. Joseph Baptist Church arson. Previously,            on October 27, 1997, defendant Michael Woods pled guilty to one count            each of the same arson related statutes.                         On November 4, 1997, the jury hearing the case involving the attempted            arson/vandalism of Tate Chapel A.M.E. Church convicted Alan Odom of            violating 18, U.S.C., Section 844(i) and acquitted him of all other            charges. Prior to the trial, Jeremy Boone, who was also charged in this            case, pled guilty to one count of violating 18, U.S.C., Section 844(i).            During the period of March 6, 1998 through March 12, 1998, each of the            subjects was sentenced. The sentences ranged from 41-180 months in prison            followed by three years of supervised probation for all subjects. In            addition, the subjects were ordered to pay restitution in the amount            of $96,836.00, jointly and severally with the other subjects to St.            Joseph Baptist Church.

The family, the only            African-Americans living in this small rural community, had resided            there for approximately two years. The flyer, which was filled with            racist and hate rhetoric, ordered the family to move from the community            within 30 days or suffer the ""wrath."" The flyer was signed,            ""Sincerely, the Last Rites."" On December 7, 1997, Daniel O'Brien            Porter, Barry Gene Dunn and Christopher Jayson Mahan were indicted and            charged with one count each of violating Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241,            and Title 42, U.S.C., Section 3631. Porter and Dunn pled guilty to the            above mentioned charges on April 6, 1998 prior to the commencement of            a federal trial. Mahan was convicted on April 7, 1998.

GX235-92-15955697	"Contact:  Sam Thompson (505) 222-9042   June 14, 2002   AG:  Judge Requires Full Restitution    in ""La Familia Grande"" Pyramid Scheme    (Albuquerque, NM)   Attorney General Patricia Madrid announced that Estevan    Apodaca, organizer of a pyramid scheme known as ""La Familia Grande"",    has been required by District Judge Ross Sanchez to provide full restitution    of up to $30,000 to victims of the scheme within 45 days.    The Judge ordered    Apodaca to appear before the court August 1, 2002, for final sentencing.   Apocada entered a plea of guilty to two felony counts of violating the Pyramid    Promotional Schemes Act in February 2002, which exposed him to a possible 3    years in prison.  Two victims of scheme spoke at the sentencing explaining their    losses in the scheme as well as Apodaca's insistence that the scheme was legal    and no one would be prosecuted.     ""Pyramid activity has been victimizing New Mexicans for too long.  I hope    that anyone who might still believe that these schemes are victimless activities    will rethink their position.  Pyramid activity is illegal under New Mexico law    - it is just that simple.  Unless the legislature is convinced to the contrary,    pyramid activity will continue to be illegal and those that take money from    others in these schemes may find themselves arrested for a felony,"" Attorney    General Madrid said.  ""When people lose money in these schemes, they turn    to law enforcement authorities or civil court for help.  The best advice I can    give to New Mexicans is simply to recognize that offers to make quick, easy    money are really opportunities for you to lose money.""   Two others indicted with Apodaca, Debbie Cattin and Paul Chavez, have entered    pre-prosecution diversion.  Making restitution to those from whom money was    taken is one of the conditions of the program.  Charges were dropped against    the fourth individual indicted with Apodaca.     Pre-prosecution diversion may be offered to individuals about whom complaints    alleging their participation in illegal pyramid activity have been filed with    the Office of the Attorney General.  Individuals who have not taken advantage    of the offer face potential indictment on criminal charges.   Pyramid activity was initially reported in New Mexico is April 2000.  At that    time, the Taos    District Attorney issued a warning about schemes called ""The Dinner Party,""    ""The Gifting Circle,"" and ""The Circle of Friends.""  The    first formal complaints about the schemes were not reported to the Office of    the Attorney General until December 2000.  The first arrests for pyramid activity    called ""Women Helping Women"" occurred in March 2001.    Approximately four hundred individuals have reported money losses in pyramid    schemes in New Mexico.  At the Attorney General's office, restitution to those    who have lost money has exceeded $50,000, with more expected over the next six    months.  Some people who have lost money have sued for restitution in magistrate    courts, this information is not available from the Office of the Attorney General.     ####"
GX253-82-13503167	OLR Bill Analysis    sHB 5059    AN ACT CONCERNING HUNTING SAFETY.    SUMMARY :    This bill creates the crimes of negligent hunting and hunting while under the influence or impaired.  It imposes enhanced penalties for persistent offenders. It generally requires the person arrested for these crimes to surrender his weapon.    By law, a hunter whose license has been suspended for violation of hunting laws must complete a remedial hunter education course designed by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) before his license can be reinstated.  The bill additionally requires the hunter to demonstrate that he has passed a conservation education/firearms safety course or its equivalent, as specified by DEP.    EFFECTIVE DATE:  October 1, 2000    NEGLIGENT HUNTING    The bill establishes four degrees of negligent hunting.  Hunting is:    1. pursuing, shooting, killing, and capturing a bird, four-legged animal, or reptile, or trying to do these things, whether or not this results in taking the animal or    2. any act of assistance in taking or attempting to take such an animal.    The bill establishes, as  prima facie  evidence that someone was hunting, his possession of a loaded hunting weapon while at, entering, or leaving an area where a reasonable person would believe the objective was to take wildlife.      But, the bill allows a person to possess a loaded long gun one hour before sunrise during deer and turkey firearms season if it does not have a live round in it.    A loaded hunting weapon is:    1. a long gun with a live round in the chamber or in a magazine attached to the gun,    2. a muzzle-loaded gun with a percussion cap in place,    3. a flintlock firearm with powder in the pan,    4. a bow with an arrow notched on it,    5. a drawn crossbow with a bolt in place, or    6. a high velocity air gun charged with a projectile in the chamber or in an attached magazine.    First Degree    A person is guilty of negligent hunting in the first degree when, with criminal negligence, he shoots a loaded hunting weapon and kills someone while hunting. Criminal negligence means failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result or circumstance described in a statute will occur.      Negligent hunting is a class D felony subject to imprisonment of one to five years, of which one year may not be suspended or reduced, a fine of up to $5,000, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    Second Degree    A person is guilty of this crime when, with criminal negligence, he (1) violates the law against jacklighting for deer or (2) shoots a loaded hunting weapon and causes serious physical injury to another person.  A serious physical injury is one that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes serious (1) disfigurement, (2) impairment of health, or (3) loss or impairment of a bodily organ's function.  The offense is a class A misdemeanor. The offender must be fined between $400 and $2,000 and can be imprisoned for up to one year.  In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to 10 years.    Third Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:      1. fires a loaded hunting weapon at a time of day when hunting is prohibited,       2. hunts on Sundays, or outside of hunting season;      3. shoots a firearm from a vehicle;      4. hunts with a suspended license; or      5. shoots an occupied dwelling.    This crime is a class B misdemeanor.  The hunter must be fined $200 to $1,000 and can be imprisoned up to six months. In addition, DEP can suspend his license for up to five years.    Fourth Degree    A person is guilty of this crime if he, while hunting:    1. hunts without buying the license, permit, or stamp required by law;    2. possesses a loaded hunting weapon during a time of day when hunting is prohibited;    3. hunts from or fires a hunting weapon across a public highway.    A person is also guilty of this crime if he hunts with or fires a firearm within (1) 250 feet of building occupied by people or domestic animals or used to store flammable or combustible material or (2) 125 feet of any of these buildings while hunting in tidal water.  This provision does not apply if the hunter is carrying the written authorization of the building's owner.     The crime is a class C misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for up to three months, a fine of up to $500, or both.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license for up to three years.    Allocation of Fines    Under the bill, fines for first-and second-degree negligent hunting go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  Fines for third-and fourth-degree negligent hunting go to the Conservation Fund, for land management or acquisition of hunting easements.    HUNTING WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OR IMPAIRED    Elements of the Crime    The bill prohibits hunting while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs.  A person is considered impaired if his blood alcohol content at the time of the offense was .07%to .10%.  A person is considered under the influence if his BAC is above .10%.  If he has been previously convicted of hunting under the influence the threshold is .07%. A person can also be found to be under the influence independent of his BAC.     The bill allows DEP enforcement officers to arrest people for this crime.    Alcohol Testing Procedures    The bill extends the laws regarding alcohol tests that currently apply to drunk boating to hunting while under the influence or while impaired.  The law specifies that the arresting officer determine whether to give a blood, breath, or urine test; if the person is unwilling or unable to submit to a blood test, the officer must designate a breath or urine test.  If the person refuses to submit to the test, none is administered.  The refusal to submit to a test is admissible in court if the person was (1) placed under arrest, (2) informed of his constitutional rights, (3) given an opportunity to call a lawyer, and (4) informed that refusal is admissible and can be used against him.      Admissibility of Test Results    As under the boating laws, the test results are admissible if:    1. the hunter was given a chance to call a lawyer and submitted to the test;    2. a true copy of the test result was mailed or delivered to the defendant within 24 hours or the end of the next business day after the result is known, whichever is later;    3. the test was performed by or at the direction of a law enforcement officer, using methods and equipment approved by the Department of Public Health (DPH);    4. the test was performed by a person certified for this purpose by DPH or recertified by a DPH-certified instructor;    5. any blood sample was taken by a medical professional with specified credentials;    6. the testing device was checked for accuracy by a DPH-certified person at the beginning and by the end of the workday; and    7. evidence is presented that demonstrates that the BAC at the time of the test accurately reflected the BAC at the time of the alleged offense.    In addition, a second test of the same type must be administered at least 30 minutes after the first test and the testing device was checked for accuracy by DPH-certified person.  But, the results of the first test can be admitted if reasonable efforts were made to conduct the second test, even if the second test was not performed, was not performed within a reasonable time, or fails to meet the other criteria.    Penalties    Violation of the bill's drunk hunting provisions is a class A misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to one year, a fine of up to $2,000, or both.  The fines go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund.  In addition, DEP can suspend the hunter's license indefinitely.    PERSISTENT OFFENDERS    Under the bill, a person convicted of (1) negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or (2) hunting while impaired or under the influence within five years of a conviction of negligent hunting is considered a persistent negligent hunter.  A persistent negligent hunter must be fined at least twice the minimum provided for the second violation, that is, $400 for a conviction of negligent hunting in third degree and $800 for a conviction of negligent hunting in the second degree.  The hunter also is subject to the penalties for the next more serious degree of negligent hunting or hunting while impaired or under the influence.  The provision has no effect with regard to the drunk hunting crimes, since they have only one degree and no minimum fine.  It appears that any fine imposed on a persistent offender would go to the General Fund.    SURRENDER OF WEAPON    The bill requires anyone arrested for negligent hunting in the first, second, or third degree or hunting under the influence or impaired to surrender any weapon in his possession.  The police or conservation officer must confiscate the weapon at the time of the arrest.  If the hunter is acquitted or the charge is dismissed or nolled, the weapon must be returned in the same condition as when it was confiscated.    If the hunter is convicted, the weapon must turned over to DEP.  DEP can (1) retain the weapon for agency use; (2) convey to the Department of Administrative Services for sale at auction, with the proceeds going to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Fund; or (3) destroy the weapon.    These provisions to not apply to weapons used to jacklight deer, which are already subject to separate disposition procedures.

Kelly, 619-557-6216      For Immediate Release    NEWS RELEASE SUMMARY       United States Attorney Carol C. Lam today announced the entry of two guilty pleas and the indictments of four individuals in the investigation of PinnFund, U.S.A., Inc. (""PinnFund"").     PinnFund was a Carlsbad-based mortgage lender closed down by court order on March 23, 2001,  upon application of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"").  Investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development - Office of the Inspector General,  in conjunction with the SEC, revealed that PinnFund had operated as a massive Ponzi scheme, resulting in losses of over $200 million by hundreds of investors.       KEITH G. GRUBBA, the former President and 40% owner of PinnFund from July 1996 to February 2001,  and MICHAEL A. TRAP, the former Syndication Manager of a related company, PinnLease USA,  entered guilty pleas in federal court before the Honorable Marilyn L. Huff to PinnFund-related criminal charges.       During his guilty plea, GRUBBA admitted  that he conspired with Michael Fanghella and John Garitta to deceive investors and thereby perpetuate the Ponzi scheme by various means, including the preparation and dissemination of false financial statements. GRUBBA admitted in court that he filed federal income tax returns for the tax years 1997 through 2000, in which he failed to declare his full income, including illegal income derived from his Ponzi scheme activity.  Grubba evaded reporting over $6.7 million in gross income for the tax years 1997 through 2000, with a tax due and owing of approximately $2.5 million.  Grubba is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday, April 21, 2003, at 9:00 a.m. ,  and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     TRAP pled guilty to charges that he lied to a federal grand jury investigating PinnFund and its subsidiary, PinnLease USA, Inc.  TRAP is scheduled to be sentenced on April 21, 2003, at 9:00 a.m., and faces up to five years' imprisonment.     In a related development,  a federal grand jury today returned a  29-count indictment against  JAMES L. HILLMAN and PIOTR KODZIS,  charging them with intentionally having defrauded investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by misrepresenting PinnFund's operations and compliance with investor agreements.  The indictment also charges that HILLMAN and KODZIS misrepresented the extent of their oversight and review of PinnFund's operations, and concealed various material facts, including their knowledge of multiple sets of contradictory PinnFund financial statements.  HILLMAN and KODZIS are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud.     A second 23-count indictment was also returned alleging  that TOMMY A. LARSEN and his son, KIM A. LARSEN, schemed  to obtain funds for PinnFund through fraudulent equipment leases and laundering their kickbacks of those funds to PinnFund through sham transactions and false invoices.  TOMMY A. LARSEN is further charged with (a) knowingly conspiring to provide funds to PinnFund through fraudulent equipment leases; (b) conspiring to skim and conceal a portion of the fraudulent lease proceeds by various means, including transportation of those  proceeds to a bank in Gibraltar; (c) committing  perjury before the United States District Court of the Southern District of California, suborning the perjury of a witness before a federal grand jury, and conspiring to obstruct justice by presenting false testimony from yet another witness before the District Court; and (d) evading his 1999 and 2000 federal income taxes by charging personal expenditures to PinnFund, structuring his compensation to avoid payroll taxes, and hiding the proceeds of illicit activity overseas.       Following his indictment, TOMMY A. LARSEN was arrested by the FBI with the assistance of the Escondido Police Department and is scheduled to be arraigned  before a federal magistrate judge on Friday, January 31, 2003, at 1:30 p.m.  KIM A. LARSEN, JAMES L. HILLMAN, and PIOTR KODZIS will be arraigned  before a federal magistrate judge on Tuesday, February 4, 2003, at 10:30 a.m.     United States Attorney Carol C. Lam said,  ""We are holding accountable those who committed one of the largest frauds to have occurred in San Diego history.   The United States Attorney's Office is committed to pursuing these complex cases and ensuring that those who commit financial crimes are brought to justice.""      The criminal investigation into PinnFund has previously yielded four other criminal convictions:     1. On March 22, 2002,   Michael J. Fanghella, former Chief Executive Officer of PinnFund, pled guilty to criminal charges that he operated PinnFund as a $300+ million Ponzi scheme that consistently lost money but was able to continue operations by attracting new investment capital and credit through, among other means, the creation of false financial statements and loan volume reports.  Fanghella is scheduled to be sentenced on February 3, 2003, and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     2. On August 23, 2002,   John D. Garitta, former Chief Financial Officer of PinnFund, pled guilty to criminal charges that he conspired with Fanghella to perpetuate the fraud by deceiving investors through the preparation and dissemination of false company financial statements.  Garitta is scheduled to be sentenced on April 14, 2003, and faces up to thirty years' imprisonment.     3. On August 23, 2002,  John C. Bykowski, a former administrative assistant at PinnFund, pled guilty to charges that he conspired with Fanghella, Garitta, and others to make cash withdrawals from PinnFund for the personal benefit of PinnFund executives, with the intent to conceal that cash income from the Internal Revenue Service.  Bykowski is also scheduled to be sentenced on April 14, 2003, and faces up to five years' imprisonment.     4. On December 3, 2002,  Kimberly A. Hulihee pled guilty to charges that she lied to a federal grand jury investigating PinnFund and its subsidiary, PinnLease USA, Inc.  Hulihee is scheduled to be sentenced on March 3, 2003, and faces up to five years' imprisonment.      Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kevin J. Kelly and Sanjay Bhandari and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Nick Morgan are assigned to the prosecution.  The cases are the result of a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigation, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General.      Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge William Gore stated, ""Today's developments in the PinnFund Investigation are the result of an extensive and intensive multi-agency investigation that should send a message to all those who would engage in such complex and fraudulent schemes.  Do not expect to go undetected or unpunished.  The renewed focus of the FBI and other agencies on such crime throughout the nation, especially at the corporate level, will continue to receive the same priority attention given this successful, yet continuing, investigation.""   Denise L. Rubin, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge for San Diego, stated, ""The personal greed of those responsible for the massive PinnFund fraud is directly linked  to the collapse of the corporation, the evasion of taxes, and investors losses of  millions of dollars.  The financial ruin caused by these types of crimes is devastating, and IRS Criminal Investigation will continue to aggressively investigate corporate officers who are involved in financial crimes.""     Kenneth M. Donohue, Inspector General, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in Washington, D.C. stated that ""The Ponzi scheme that was discovered at PinnFund represented one of the largest investment fraud cases in Southern California.  The Office of Inspector General for HUD is committed to investigating fraudulent activities and will aggressively pursue any person or entity responsible for the use of false financial statements to perpetrate fraud involving HUD programs.""

GX249-20-2677164	"April 07, 2002          Human Tragedy Brings Tough Decisions for Judges         By  GARY JAHRIG  of the Missoulian     April 7, 2002         When someone takes the life of another person through negligence, what should happen? It's a question even seasoned judges and lawyers have a tough time answering           Since taking his place on the bench as a Missoula District Court judge more than a dozen years ago, Ed McLean has passed sentence on an array of murderers, rapists, thieves, habitual drunken drivers and other felons.         But McLean readily admits that he's hard-pressed to remember a judgment he's had to make that was as gut-wrenching as the negligent homicide sentence he handed down in February to William Andrew Johnson, who killed James Neumayer, 22, his 1-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn, and 18-year-old Amber Knutsen in June 2000 when his car crossed the centerline on U.S. Highway 93 South near Lolo and smashed head-on into two other vehicles.         ""That was as tough as they get,"" McLean said. ""You had good families and totally innocent people whose lives were taken. But at the same time, you had a person with an illness"" who caused the accident.         Johnson had blacked out moments before the wreck after suffering a diabetic reaction caused by his failure to take appropriate medication to control his blood-sugar level. After months of negotiations, Johnson avoided going to trial on the negligent homicide charge by reaching a plea agreement with the Missoula County Attorney's Office.         McLean sentenced Johnson to nine years on probation. He barred him from ever driving again and warned him that if he violates conditions of his probation by driving, he could spend up to 60 years in prison.         The sentence meant the 48-year-old Johnson, who was not jailed prior to his sentencing, would spend no time behind bars for killing three people.         Johnson's case is a prime illustration of the inconsistent nature of negligent homicide sentences, where defendants can be incarcerated for 20 years, or not at all, for killing one or more people.         Almost to a person, those in the legal profession who deal regularly with people who commit the most serious criminal offenses - judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys and probation officers - agree that punishing felons convicted of negligent homicide is an extremely difficult task.         ""You don't read the presentence report on a negligent homicide just once. You have to read it and weigh the circumstances at least two or three times,"" McLean said. ""Negligent homicide is probably the toughest sentence to impose.""         The Johnson case is one of three highly publicized negligent homicide cases involving vehicle-related deaths that have been adjudicated in Missoula over the past two months. The cases were all similar in that they involved drivers of vehicles being responsible for the deaths of innocent parties.         But the similarities end there. The circumstances surrounding the deaths and the punishments handed down to the three convicted killers by three different judges vary greatly.         While Johnson escaped incarceration, Michelle Herd, a 28-year-old Washington woman who killed four members of the Good family of Seeley Lake - Stacy, 53, Kilty, 22, Arundel, 18, and Tully, 13 - in a fiery crash near Potomac in December 2000, received six months in a prerelease center and a lifetime ban on driving.         Angela Shultz, a 21-year-old Missoula woman who killed 12-year-old Larry Pyette last May while driving drunk, got what amounted to a five-year sentence in which she will likely spend time in prison, a state boot camp and a prerelease center.         Shultz was the only one of the three who was intoxicated at the time of the fatal incident. Herd was driving down the wrong side of a two-lane highway in a fatigued state as she rushed to her critically ill mother's hospital bedside. Johnson simply failed to take care of himself.         The only other common denominator in the cases was that the negligence of Johnson, Herd and Shultz all resulted in tragedy and had devastating affects on the family and friends of the victims.         Larson said the reason that negligent homicide sentences are harder to predict is simply the people charged with the offenses. That the three most recently resolved cases in Missoula had different outcomes comes as no surprise to the nine-year District Court judge.         ""You look at any three negligent homicide cases and you will find a wide range of sentences,"" Larson said. ""No two defendants are at all alike. Their ages, experiences in the criminal justice system and circumstances of the actual accidents vary greatly. And the much larger role of the victim's family in sentencing could also account for the difference. ... And with negligent homicide, the sentences generally have an individual component that the judge puts in that is not in the presentence report.""         Under Montana law, the offense of negligent homicide occurs when a ""person negligently causes the death of another human being."" It carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.         Referred to as negligent homicide in Montana, the same or similar offense in other states is often called manslaughter. Other states also have vehicular homicide statutes on the books, which covers deaths caused only through driving negligence.         While many of the defendants charged with negligent homicide in Montana have killed someone through their driving, the Montana charge can be applied to an array of accidental deaths ranging from hunting accidents to parents leaving children unattended in vehicles.         ""In general, there are two kinds of negligence that lead to negligent homicide charges,"" said Karen Townsend, the chief deputy Missoula County attorney and a 25-year prosecutor. ""There are acts of commission like drunk driving where you end up causing a traffic fatality. Or the other is acts of omission, like where you fail to provide medical care to an injured baby.         ""When you are talking negligence, you must show not just ordinary negligence. ... You must prove reckless disregard or what the law calls gross negligence. It's a pretty high standard.""         According to statistics calculated by the Missoulian from a state Department of Corrections database, in the past 12 years, 171 people have died as a result of negligent homicide in Montana in 37 counties. Perhaps reflecting population centers, the most deaths occurred in Yellowstone (17), Flathead and Lake counties (16 each), Cascade (15), Missoula (13) and Lewis and Clark (11).         Of the 158 people convicted in that time, 33 of them went to prison for stays ranging from three to 20 years. Three-quarters of those got 10-year sentences.         Another 49 received prison terms with some time suspended. Thirty-four of them got 10-year sentences, and 25 of them served at least half their sentence incarcerated.         One in five of those convicted were between 15 and 20 years old, and just over half were under 30. The number of negligent homicide incidents declines by age until the mid-30s, when the graph shows a spike among 36-45-year-olds.         Younger felons are much less likely to spend time in prison than their middle-aged counterparts. Those between 15 and 20 went to jail one out of every three incidents, while those between 36 and 40 were sentenced to prison 68 percent of the time. Of those between 46 and 50, just one out of five avoided prison in their sentence.         Townsend and others in the criminal justice system say the disparity between age and serving prison time is primarily due to the fact that older people are more likely to have criminal records prior to their negligent homicide convictions.         ""If a person has a criminal record in their past, there's more of a chance you will ask for some sort of incarceration,"" Townsend said.         Another variable in negligent homicide cases, Townsend said, is the fact that Montana does not have sentencing guidelines, which permits judges to ""take into account individual nuances about each case.""         ""With negligent homicide, you have a wide variety of different people committing the same offense. The facts of the case differ in all cases,"" she said. ""But you must ask 'do the acts committed rise to the level of the charge.' You do that for every case, but you don't ask the question unless there has been a death.""         Margaret Borg, Missoula County's chief public defender, has represented numerous people charged with negligent homicide in her more than 25 years as a defense attorney. She agrees wholeheartedly with her colleagues that negligent homicide is among the most unpredictable sentences.         ""I think the hardest thing for me to control ... is the wild card of what the victim's family demands,"" Borg said.         In all negligent homicide cases, the victim's survivors are consulted extensively before sentencing and are given the right to speak at sentencing hearings. As a defense attorney, the wishes of the victim's family often play a role in how Borg defends her clients.         Often with negligent homicide sentences, the end result can simply be another message against drinking and driving, Borg said. But she's not sure if such a message is very effective.         ""The people who wouldn't do that sort of thing anyway are the ones who hear the message the loudest,"" Borg said. ""The ones most likely involved in that type of behavior don't hear the message. I'm not sure the audience it's directed at actually gets the message. It sends the right message, but whether it affects the right audience is questionable.""         After spending 30 years working as a probation and parole officer, Sam Lemaich is not easily surprised when it comes to felony sentences.         Except when it comes to negligent homicide.         ""Negligent homicide is definitely one of the most unpredictable,"" said Lemaich, the Missoula-based regional administrator of probation and parole. ""You just never know because there are so many variables not there in so many other offenses.""         The Johnson case, for example, charted completely new ground for Lemaich and his staff - the people responsible for preparing presentence reports for District Court judges.         ""I've been doing this 30 years, but the diabetic case was a real twist for me,"" he said. ""This was not someone who did something like drink or take drugs. This happened because he didn't do something. In 30 years I never saw one like that.""         So Lemaich wasn't all that surprised when Judge McLean did not follow the presentence report prepared by his office for the Johnson case.         ""We recommended something completely different than what the judge did,"" Lemaich said. ""We recommended commitment to the Department of Corrections with the idea of him being placed in a prerelease center. He ended up getting a deferred sentence. But in negligent homicide there are so many facts and emotions to consider, you can never be sure.""         What Lemaich and his staffers try to do is give a judge as much background information on a defendant as possible before sentencing takes place. They also make a recommendation on every felony sentence that goes before a judge.         After a defendant either pleads guilty or is convicted of a felony offense, a probation officer is assigned the task of preparing an extensive presentence report.         ""All felony cases have presentence investigations,"" Lemaich said. ""The investigation is a pretty important document for everybody involved. It's supposed to be the independent, objective voice in the situation. The county attorney and the defendant have vested interests. And judges are not bound by plea bargains. We gather a lot of information and present it to the judge with a recommendation.""         Presentence reports are generally extensive investigative documents that can take up to 30 hours to prepare when it comes to negligent homicide cases. The probation officer preparing the report first summarizes police reports, county attorney files and past interviews with the defendant. They then have the defendant fill out an extensive questionnaire and conduct further interviews with the subject to be sentenced.         Lemaich said the reports also contain the defendant's complete criminal history and a social history that includes places of residence, past employment and family background. The officer also tries to speak to spouses and other family members about the defendant.         Once the personal background is complete, the probation officer turns to the victim's family and friends.         ""In the case of negligent homicide or rape, we put a lot of emphasis on victim impact,"" he said. ""We contact the survivors of victims and talk to them personally and offer them an opportunity to send letters to express their feelings. ... A lot of times they are very angry.""         When the presentence report is complete, it is placed in a sealed envelope and presented to the judge before the defendant's sentencing hearing.         ""Part of the reason negligent homicide sentences are all over the board is that no two are the same and no two judges are the same,"" Lemaich said. ""You have all this extraneous information put in the pot and the judge has to process it. Ultimately the judge makes the decision. In 90 percent of other felonies, the judge follows the presentence recommendations. But in negligent homicide, I don't know. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.""         Lemaich said that after spending some 30 hours preparing a recommendation, it's only human nature for probation officers to become personally attached to the case.         ""I would be lying to say that the probation officer is not vested in these. They put a lot of time into it,"" Lemaich said. ""It can be emotionally draining. But we're just one part of the judicial system. Judges are judges. ... It's their job to make the ultimate decision.""         With prisons bursting at the seams and courtroom calendars packed on a daily basis, it's not uncommon for the average felon to get three strikes before prison enters the equation.         ""As a general rule, a person can commit three felonies before they end up in prison,"" Judge McLean said.         A first conviction usually earns the defendant a deferred sentence, where the charge can be stricken from their record if they follow the terms of their sentence and commit no further crimes during that time period. The second felony generally is worth a suspended sentence, McLean said, where the conviction remains on the defendant's record, but no prison time is required if they stay out of trouble. A third trip before the judge on a felony offense typically opens the prison doors.         ""The two places we make exceptions are deliberate homicide and sexual assault,"" McLean said. ""If a person inflicts that type of injury intentionally ... then we're talking of an infliction that causes both emotional and physical injuries. That normally means prison.""         Then there's negligent homicide, where even judges admit sentencing is a highly unpredictable business.         ""Negligent homicide is definitely the exception to the rule,"" McLean said. ""You could go to prison for negligent homicide or you could not. There's just so many variables to consider.""         McLean said when negligent homicide occurs, it usually falls into one of two categories.         ""More often than not, the accident involves taking the life of a loved one or family member. Then you have the victim's family telling you the driver has been punished enough,"" McLean said. ""Or there are ones where you have someone under the influence of alcohol taking the life of a stranger. That completely changes things and you have people asking for incarceration.         ""The problem you have in a lot of negligent homicides is that you have someone coming before the court that does not have a criminal history. You have a law-abiding citizen who made a one-time mistake that turned out tragic. It's a whole different ball game with someone who has a prior conviction for drunken driving.""         McLean said judges must carefully weigh the value of taking a human life with the assurance that the defendant will not have the opportunity to commit such an act again.         ""The bottom line when you get through it all is what is the likelihood of this happening again. There's no question there has to be some cost of taking the life of an innocent person. But when it's done accidentally, what do you do? What's very difficult is that you know the poor victim's family has suffered such a loss and when you take the loss into account, you want to make certain it never happens again.""         Judge Larson said the presentence report is a vital tool when deciding a negligent homicide sentence.         ""(Probation officers) are well trained and take it very serious. They are very independent and are not tied to one side or the other,"" Larson said. ""Generally presentence reports take 30 minutes to read. With negligent homicide you spend more time. And you generally give negligent homicide cases a separate hearing that doesn't run in the regular law and motion format. I think it's helpful for the defendant and the victim's family to have a separate time with nothing else going on.""         While he relies heavily on presentence reports, Larson is quick to point out that judges are not bound by it, just as they are not required to follow the terms of plea agreements struck between prosecutors and defense attorneys.         ""The report gives you a start. But negligent homicide sentences generally have an individual component that the judge puts in that is not in the report,"" he said.         For example in the Herd case, Larson added a stipulation not in the presentence report that bars Herd from holding a driver's license for at least 40 years - a part of the sentence that was applauded by surviving members of the Good family.              Finally, the wishes of the victim's family must also be considered before imposing sentence, Larson said, particularly when multiple deaths occur, such as the Herd case where four members of the same family perished as a result of the defendant's negligence.         ""When you get into multiple deaths, it's even more important to look at the victim's family and find out where they are at. In a multiple death scenario, the function of the sentence is often therapeutic and helps close the case for the victim's family,"" Larson said.         ""The much larger role of the victim's family in negligent homicide cases could account for the differences in sentences. ... You want an example to be underlined so future conduct will be set for the community.""         Both Larson and McLean also said they realize that family members of victims are not always thinking clearly when it comes time to hand out punishment.         ""You see some anger and frustration, but I think a lot of it is they are acting out of grief,"" Larson said. ""I don't think you see a lot of vindictiveness in negligent homicide cases.

GX029-39-10842036	"Sept. 29, 2000       Greene County man sentenced to eight years in connection with $6 million investment Ponzi scheme    Springfield, Mo. -- A Greene County man was sentenced to eight years in prison today after pleading guilty to criminal charges that he operated a $6 million environmental investment scheme that paid early investors with money paid by later investors. Schemes that pay early investors with later investors' money are known as Ponzi schemes.    Dale Wayne McCurry (DOB - 1/2/59), of Fair Grove, was indicted on 13 counts last February by a Greene County grand jury at the request of Attorney General Jay Nixon, whose office then prosecuted the case. Nixon said that from 1994 through 1998, McCurry solicited investments totaling more than $6 million from more than 200 investors, some of whom invested as much as $447,000.    McCurry told investors he was operating a successful environmental business that purchased ""waste-eating micro-bacterial bugs."" McCurry used the proceeds from later sales to pay off early investors to create the facade that the business operations of McCurry Environmental Solutions were financially successful.     Greene County Circuit Judge Don E. Burrell Jr. sentenced McCurry to eight years in prison after McCurry pleaded guilty to four counts of securities fraud, three counts of selling unregistered securities, two counts of selling securities as an unregistered agent, three counts of stealing by deceit and one count of passing a bad check.     McCurry's Missouri sentence will run concurrent to the five years remaining on federal convictions for mail fraud and money laundering related to the scheme. He was returned to federal prison after being sentenced today.                                 Missouri Revised Statutes        Sept. 29, 2000"

The four count indictment, returned yesterday and unsealed today, charges Michelle Leigh Dunn, 21, Jerry Lynn Jones, 25, and Robert Marion Treece, 24, with conspiring to set fire to the Universal Church of God on May 25, 1995.  Treece also faces charges of intimidating a witness in connection with a subsequent investigation of the incident.    ""Today's case underscores our ongoing commitment to find and prosecute those who attack our nation's houses of worship,"" said James E. Johnson, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Enforcement and Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Co-Chairs of the National Church Arson Task Force.      The first three counts of the indictment charges the three defendants with conspiring to set fire to a mobile home trailer used by the church as a Christian school in order to intimidate African-American members of the church.  Count four charges Treece with threatening a witness in order to prevent the communication of information about the fire to federal law enforcement officers.    The maximum possible prison term for all of the charges returned against Dunn, Jones, and Treece is forty years in prison.  In addition to prison terms, each defendant could also be sentenced to fines of $250,000 for each count of the indictment.    The indictment was the result of a joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  The investigation began in August 1997, after the fire at the Universal Church of God.  The Task Force also opened an investigation into an earlier fire at the church that had been set in May, 1995.  The second fire remains under investigation.         More than 600 hundred arsons of houses of worship have been reported to the Church Arson Task Force since January 1995.  Already, 273 suspects have been arrested in connection with 204 arsons.    An indictment is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt.  A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.   # # #     98-183"
