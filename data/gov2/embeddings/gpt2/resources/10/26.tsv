US-AR       Web site   www.arkansas.gov       Arkansas  (are-can-saw) is a state located in the  southern region  of the  United States of America . Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the  Mississippi River . Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the  Ozarks  and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the interior highlands, to the eastern lowlands along the  Mississippi River . The capital and most populous city is Little Rock, located in the central portion of the state.   Little Rock became the center of international attention in 1957 when then Gov. Orval Faubus sent the Arkansas National Guard to prevent nine  African-American  students from enrolling at Central High School. In response, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1,000 paratroops to escort the African-American students. This incident eventually led to the closing of Little Rock high schools for the rest of the school year, but the schools were completely integrated by the fall of 1959.   Early  Spanish  or  French  explorers gave the state its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the Illinois tribal word for the Quapaw people, who lived downriver from them. The pronunciation ""arkansaw"" was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881.

[2]  Arkansas shares its southern border with  Louisiana , its northern border with  Missouri , its eastern border with  Tennessee  and  Mississippi , and its western border with  Texas  and  Oklahoma .   Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick  forests  and fertile plains. Northwest Arkansas is part of the Ozark Plateau including the Boston Mountains, to the south are the Ouachita Mountains, and these regions are divided by the  Arkansas River . The mountain ranges are part of the interior highlands of the  United States , the only major mountainous region between the  Rocky Mountains  and the  Appalachian Mountains . [3] [4]  The highest point in the state is Magazine Mountain in the Ouachita Mountains; it rises to 2,753 feet above sea level.   The southern and eastern parts of the state are called the Lowlands but are better known by the names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The Arkansas Delta is a flat landscape of rich alluvial  soils  formed by repeated flooding of the adjacent Mississippi. Farther away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.   The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as Crowley's Ridge. A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.          Buffalo National River, one of many attractions that give the state its nickname of  The Natural State .       Arkansas is home to many  caves , such as Blanchard Springs Caverns. It is also the first U.S. state in which diamonds were found, near the city of Murfreesboro. [5]   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the  National Park System , including Hot Springs National Park. The  Trail of Tears  National Historic Trail also runs through the state.     Climate   Arkansas generally has a humid, subtropical climate. While not bordering the  Gulf of Mexico , Arkansas is still close enough to this large, warm body of  water  for it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 to 1,500 mm), though it is somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. [6]  While  snowfall  is not uncommon, the amounts are low in most years; the average snowfall is around 5 inches (13 cm). [7]   Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme weather. Located between the Great Plains and the Gulf states, Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms per year. As a part of  Tornado Alley,  tornadoes are a common occurrence, and a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of tropical systems that dump tremendous amounts of  rain  in a short time and often spawn smaller tornadoes.     History     Mississippian culture   The Mississippian culture was a mound-building  Native American  culture that flourished in an area that included what is now Arkansas from approximately 800  C.E.  to 1500  C.E. , varying regionally. A number of cultural traits are recognized as being characteristic of the Mississippians, including     The construction of truncated pyramid mounds, or platform mounds. Structures (domestic houses, temples, burial buildings, or other) were usually constructed atop such mounds.   Maize -based  agriculture . In most places, the development of Mississippian culture coincided with adoption of comparatively large-scale, intensive maize agriculture.   Widespread trade networks extending as far west as the  Rockies , north to the  Great Lakes , south to the  Gulf of Mexico , and east to the  Atlantic Ocean .   The development of the chiefdom or complex chiefdom level of social complexity that could be comparable at different points to post-Roman, pre-consolidation tribal England.   A centralization of control of combined political and religious power in the hands of few or one.   The beginnings of a settlement hierarchy, in which one major center (with mounds) has clear influence or control over a number of lesser communities, which may or may not possess a smaller number of mounds.     The Native American nations that lived in Arkansas prior to the westward movement of American settlers were the Quapaw, Caddo, and  Osage  nations, all of whom were descended from the Mississippian culture. While moving westward, the Five Civilized Tribes inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.     European contact   The first European to reach Arkansas was the  Spanish  explorer Hernando de Soto, who arrived in the mid-sixteenth century. Some encounters were violent, others relatively peaceable. After the destruction and flight of the de Soto expedition, the Mississippian peoples continued their way of life with little direct European influence. Indirectly, however, European introductions would change the face of the Eastern United States.  Diseases  undermined the social order of many chiefdoms, while some groups adopted European  horses  and reverted to  nomadism . Political structures collapsed in many places. By the time more documentary evidence was available, the Mississippian way of life had changed irrevocably. Some groups maintained an oral tradition link to their mound-building past, while other groups, having migrated many hundreds of miles and losing their elders to diseases, did not remember that their own ancestors had built the mounds dotting the landscape.   The early Spanish or  French  explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the Illinois tribal word for the Quapaw people, who lived downriver from them [8] .     Territory and statehood   Arkansas is one of several U.S. states formed from the territory purchased from  Napoleon Bonaparte  in the  Louisiana Purchase . The region was organized as the Territory of Arkansaw on July 4, 1819, and the territory was admitted to the Union on June 15, 1836, becoming the 25th state and the 13th slave state.   Arkansas played a key role in aiding  Texas  in its war for independence with  Mexico , sending troops and materials. The proximity of the town of Washington to the Texas border involved the town in the Texas Revolution of 1835-1836. Some evidence suggests that  Sam Houston  and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834.  [9]  When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the eastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battlefields.   When the  Mexican-American War  began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Ten companies of men assembled there and were formed into the first regiment of Arkansas cavalry.   Arkansas refused to join the  Confederate States of America  until after United States President  Abraham Lincoln  called for troops to respond to the attack on Fort Sumter,  South Carolina , by Confederate forces. The State of Arkansas seceded from the  Union  on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in history, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the  American Civil War .   Under the  Military Reconstruction Act , Congress readmitted Arkansas in June 1868.   In 1905-1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of German,  Slovak , and  Irish  immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state, and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast. The Germans and Slovaks were all Roman Catholic families. The Irish were usually  Protestants  from Ulster.     Role in Desegregation   After the desegregation case  Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka  was decided in 1954, the Little Rock Nine incident brought Arkansas to national attention when the federal government was forced to interfere in the Arkansan capital. Gov. Orval Faubus sent the Arkansas National Guard to aid segregationists in preventing nine  African-American  students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1,000 paratroops to escort the  African-American  students on September 25, 1957. This incident eventually led to the closing of Little Rock high schools for the rest of the school year, but the schools were completely integrated by the fall of 1959. [10]   Bill Clinton , the 42nd president of the United States, was born in Hope, Arkansas. Before his presidency, Clinton served nearly 12 years as governor of Arkansas.     Demographics          Arkansas Population Density Map       In 2006, Arkansas had an estimated population of 2,810,872,  [11]  which is an increase of 1.1 percent from the prior year and an increase of 4.0 percent since the year 2000. Immigration from outside the  United States  resulted in a net increase of 21,947 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 35,664 people. It is estimated that about 48.8 percent is male, and 51.2 percent is female. From 2000 through 2006 Arkansas had a population growth of 5.1 percent.   The five largest ancestry groups in the state are: White  American  - those disregarding ethnicity of ancestry and simply claiming ""American"" (15.9 percent),  African-American  (15.7 percent),  Irish  (9.5 percent), German (9.3 percent), English (7.9 percent).   People of European ancestry have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. African-Americans live mainly in the fertile southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English, and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border.   As of 2000, 95.07 percent of residents age 5 and older speak English at home and 3.31 percent speak Spanish. German is the third most spoken language at 0.299 percent, followed by French at 0.291 percent and Vietnamese at 0.13 percent. [12] .     Religion   Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the Bible Belt and is overwhelmingly  Protestant . The religious affiliations of the people are as follows: [13]          Little Rock is Arkansas' capital and most populous city         Christian  86 percent    Protestant   78 percent    Baptist   39 percent   Methodist   9 percent   Pentecostal  6 percent   Church of Christ  6 percent   Assemblies of God  3 percent   Other Protestant  15 percent       Roman Catholic  7 percent   Orthodox Christian  <1 percent   Other Christian  <1 percent       Other Religions  <1 percent   Non-Religious  14 percent       Economy          The quarter for Arkansas from the 50 State Quarters program. Released October 20 2003.       The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2006 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau [14] . The state's  agriculture  outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum,  cattle ,  cotton , rice,  hogs , and milk. Its industrial outputs are  food processing , electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery,  paper  products, bromine, and  vanadium .   In recent years,  automobile  parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. The city of Conway is the site of a school bus factory.   Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname ""The Natural State"" (as in ""Arkansas Is a Natural"") was originally created for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and it is still regularly used. Some 600,000 acres of  lakes  provide opportunities for  fishing , swimming, sailing, power-boating,  scuba diving  and more. The Ozark-St. Francis and Ouachita National Forests offer campgrounds, hiking trails, horseback or ATV trails, scenic drives, picnic areas, shooting ranges, and opportunities to watch wildlife,  fish , hunt, or  canoe .   According to Forbes.com, Arkansas ranks 21st among the Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8 percent.     Government and politics          The Arkansas State Capitol building in Little Rock.       Little Rock is the  capital  and the most populous city of Arkansas, and the county seat of Pulaski County. It is located near the geographic center of the state. According to the 2007 US census, its population was estimated at 187,452. Little Rock, North Little Rock and Conway are co-principal cities of the six-county Little RockNorth Little RockConway Metropolitan Statistical Area, an area with a population of 666,401 people, according to 2007 census estimates. That region is in turn included in the larger Little RockNorth Little RockPine Bluff Combined Statistical Area, which had a population of 841,325 in the 2007 census estimates.   Early travelers used a stone outcropping on the bank of the  Arkansas River  as a landmark. ""La Petite Roche"" (French for ""the Little Rock""), so named in 1722 by French explorer Jean-Baptiste Bnard de la Harpe, marked the transition from the flat Mississippi Delta region to the Ouachita Mountain foothills. Travelers would refer to the area as ""the Little Rock"" and the name endured.   In 1821, Little Rock became the capital of the Arkansas Territory, it was incorporated as a city in 1831, and became the official capital city when Arkansas became the 25th state in 1836.   The Democratic Party holds super-majority status in the Arkansas General Assembly. A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern  South , where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionnative son  Bill Clinton while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. In 2004, George W. Bush won the state of Arkansas by 9 points, leading some to speculate that the state was shifting toward the Republicans. In 2006, however, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices in a sweep that included regaining the governorship.   Most Republican strength lies in northwest Arkansas, in the areas around Fort Smith and Bentonville, and especially in north-central Arkansas around the Mountain Home area, where voters have often voted 90 percent Republican. The rest of the state is strongly Democratic, especially Little Rock and the areas along the  Mississippi River . Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the U.S. Senate since  Reconstruction .   The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic legislature in the country, after  Massachusetts ,  Hawaii , and  Connecticut . Arkansas is also the only state among the states of the former  Confederacy  that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate, and the overwhelming majority of registered voters in the state are Democrats. The state is socially conservative  its voters passed a ban on gay marriage with 74 percent voting yes, the Arkansas Constitution protects the right to work, and the state is one of a handful that has legislation on its books banning  abortion  in the event  Roe vs. Wade  is ever overturned.   In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.   Each officer's term is four years. Office holders are term-limited to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term.   Some of Arkansas's counties have two county seats, as opposed to the usual one. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer as difficult as it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two-seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.   Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law, a response to residents of  Kansas  who used to pronounce the state's name as ar-KANSAS, as they continue to pronounce the  Arkansas River  (""ar-KANSAS River"").   The state constitution specifies that  atheists  are disqualified from holding office or testifying as witnesses.

Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the  Mississippi River . Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the  Ozarks  and the  Ouachita Mountains , which make up the  U.S. Interior Highlands , to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is  Little Rock , located in the central portion of the state.

The Kansas tribe of American Indians are closely associated with the  Sioux  tribes. The word is a  French  pronunciation of a  Quapaw  (a related ""Kaw"" tribe) word meaning ""land of downriver people"" or ""people of the south wind"". The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881 after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name  /rknzs/   ar- KAN -zs  and the other wanted  /rkns/   AR -kn-saw . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Geography     See also:  List of Arkansas counties ,  List of cities in Arkansas ,  List of Arkansas townships , and  List of Arkansas native plants     The  Mississippi River  forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in  Clay  and  Greene  counties where the  St. Francis River  forms the western boundary of the  Missouri Bootheel , and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified. [ 5 ]  Arkansas shares its southern border with  Louisiana , its northern border with  Missouri , its eastern border with  Tennessee  and  Mississippi , and its western border with  Texas  and  Oklahoma .   Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. The so-called Lowlands are better known by names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The  Arkansas Delta  is a flat landscape of  rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding  of the adjacent Mississippi. Further away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.   The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as  Crowley's Ridge . A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet (150 m) above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.   Northwest Arkansas is part of the  Ozark Plateau  including the  Boston Mountains , to the south are the  Ouachita Mountains  and these regions are divided by the  Arkansas River ; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. All of these mountains ranges are part of the  U.S. Interior Highlands  region, the only major mountainous region between the  Rocky Mountains  and the  Appalachian Mountains . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The highest point in the state is  Mount Magazine  in the  Ozark Mountains ; it rises to 2,753 feet (839 m) above sea level.           Buffalo National River , one of many attractions that give the state's nickname  The Natural State .       Arkansas is home to many  caves , such as  Blanchard Springs Caverns . It is currently the only U.S. state in which  diamonds  are mined [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  (near  Murfreesboro ). Arkansas has the only operating diamond mine in the United States.   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the  National Park System . These include: [ 10 ]     Arkansas Post National Memorial  at  Gillett   Buffalo National River   Fort Smith National Historic Site   Hot Springs National Park   Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site   Pea Ridge National Military Park     The  Trail of Tears  National Historic Trail also runs through Arkansas. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Climate   Arkansas generally has a  humid subtropical climate , which borders on  humid continental  in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the  Gulf of Mexico , Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. In Little Rock, the daily high temperatures average around 90 F (32 C) in the summer and close to 50 F (10 C) in winter. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 to 1,500 mm); somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. [ 11 ]  Snowfall is not uncommon, but not excessive in most years, as the average snowfall is approximately five inches (13 cm). [ 12 ]   Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme weather. Between both the  Great Plains  and the  Gulf States , Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. As a part of  Tornado Alley , tornadoes are not an uncommon occurrence in Arkansas, and a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a  tropical system  which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.   High water pouring down the  White River  caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern Arkansas.

Arkansas is one of several  U.S. states  formed from the territory purchased from  Napoleon Bonaparte  in the  Louisiana Purchase . The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the  Illinois  word for the  Quapaw  people, who lived downriver from them [ 14 ] . Other  Native American  nations that lived in Arkansas prior to westward movement were the Quapaw,  Caddo , and  Osage  nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S.  Indian removal  policies), the  Five Civilized Tribes  inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.   The  Territory of Arkansaw [ 4 ]  was organized on July 4, 1819, and on June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the  Union  as the 25th  state  and the 13th  slave state . Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton, and this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.   Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of  Washington  to the Texas border involved the town in the  Texas Revolution  of 1835-36. Some evidence suggests  Sam Houston  and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834. [ 15 ]  When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.   When the  Mexican-American War  began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.   The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population. [ 16 ]   Arkansas refused to join the  Confederate States of America  until after  United States President   Abraham Lincoln  called for troops to respond to the attack on  Fort Sumter ,  South Carolina , by Confederate forces. The State of Arkansas seceded from the  Union  on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the  American Civil War . Arkansans of note during the Civil War included Confederate Major General  Patrick Cleburne . Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as ""The Stonewall of the West."" Also of note was Major General  Thomas C. Hindman . A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the  Battle of Cane Hill  and  Battle of Prairie Grove .   Under the  Military Reconstruction Act , Congress readmitted Arkansas in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage, a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. Years later, as conservative Democrats began to regain political power, the legislature passed a new constitution in 1874.   In 1874, the  Brooks-Baxter War , a political struggle between factions of the  Republican Party  shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President  Ulysses S. Grant  ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters. [ 17 ]   In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation, to combat a controversy then raging around the proper pronunciation of the state's name. (See Law and Government below).   After Reconstruction the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Some were originally recruited to work as farm labor in the developing Delta region. Some immigration continued into the early decades of the 20th century. The state witnessed numbers of  Chinese ,  Italian ,  Syrian  and immigrants from eastern Europe who made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In addition, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. The Chinese and Italians moved quickly out of positions as farm labor. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college. [ 18 ]   Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance,  Eureka Springs  in  Carroll County  grew to 10,000 people, having become a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its springs. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as  Hot Springs .   In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 the state constitution was amended to include a  poll tax  and related residency requirements, which adversely affected poor people and forced them from electoral rolls. By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the  white primary  in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process, as only in the primary was there any competition. The state was one-party for decades. [ 19 ]   Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of  German ,  Slovak , and  Irish  immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the  Prairie , and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly  Protestant  from  Ulster ,  Northern Ireland ,  United Kingdom   After the case of  Brown v. Topeka Board of Education  in 1954, the  Little Rock Nine  brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor  Orval Faubus  ordered the  Arkansas National Guard  to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated. [ 20 ]   Bill Clinton , the 42nd  President of the United States , was born in  Hope, Arkansas . Before his presidency, Clinton served nearly twelve years as the 40th and 42nd  Governor  of Arkansas.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 52,214 people (that is 198,800 births minus 146,586 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 57,611 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 21,947 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 35,664 people. It is estimated that about 48.8% is male, and 51.2% is female. From 2000 through 2006 Arkansas has had a population growth of 5.1% or 137,472. [ 22 ]  The population density of the state is 51.3 people per square mile.   The  center of population  of Arkansas is located in the far northeast corner of  Perry County .

[3]   People of European ancestry have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the fertile southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly  Scotch-Irish , Protestants from  Northern Ireland  and the  Scottish  lowlands, part of the largest group of immigrants from  Great Britain  and  Ireland  before the American Revolution. Scots-Irish settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. [ 24 ]   As of 2000, 95.07% of Arkansas residents age 5 and older speak  English  at home and 3.31% speak  Spanish .  German  is the third most spoken language at 0.299%, followed by  French  at 0.291% and  Vietnamese  at 0.13%. [ 25 ]   In 2006, Arkansas has a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 24% of adults smoking. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the  Bible Belt  and is predominantly Protestant. The religious affiliations of the people are as follows: [ 27 ]          Arkansas Population Density Map         Christian : 86%    Protestant : 78%    Baptist : 39%   Methodist : 9%   Pentecostal : 6%   Church of Christ [ disambiguation needed ] : 6%   Assemblies of God : 3%   Other Protestant: 15%       Roman Catholic : 7%   Orthodox Christian : <1%   Mormon/LDS : <.5%   Other Christian: <1%       Other religions: <1%   Non-religious: 14%     The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the  Southern Baptist Convention  with 665,307; the  United Methodist Church  with 179,383; the  Roman Catholic Church  with 115,967; and the  American Baptist Association  with 115,916. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Economy          The quarter for Arkansas, released  October 20  2003.       The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2004 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ 29 ]  The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.   Several global companies are headquartered in the northwest corner of Arkansas, including  Wal-Mart  (the world's largest public corporation by revenue in 2007), [ 30 ]   J.B. Hunt  and  Tyson Foods . This area of the state has experienced an economic boom since the 1970s as a result.   In recent years,  automobile  parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Additionally, the city of  Conway  is the site of a school bus factory.   Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname ""The Natural State"" was originally created (as ""Arkansas Is A Natural"") for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still regularly used to this day.   According to Forbes.com [ 31 ]  Arkansas currently ranks 21st for The Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8% or ranked 22nd.     [ edit ]   Taxation          A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn       Arkansas imposes a  state income tax  with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on  Social Security , or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions (in addition to recovery of  cost basis ). Residents of  Texarkana, Arkansas  are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of  Texarkana, Texas  are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ( sales ) tax and compensating ( use ) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.   In addition to the state sales tax, there are more than 300  local taxes  in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales  tax exemption  for  electricity  usage.   Sales of  alcoholic beverages  account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding  beer ) at  restaurants . A 4% tax is due on the sale of all  mixed drinks  (except beer and  wine ) sold for ""on-premises"" consumption. And a 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.   Property taxes  are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.

A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern  South , where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionnative son  Bill Clinton while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for  John McCain  in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady  Hillary Clinton's  failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the Arkansas Democratic Party regaining the governorship, and in 2008, Mark Pryor was re-elected without opposition.   Most Republican strength lies mainly in the areas around  Fort Smith  and  Bentonville , as well as North Central Arkansas around the  Mountain Home  area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the U.S. Senate since  Reconstruction ,  Tim Hutchinson , who was defeated after one term by  Mark Pryor . The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after  Massachusetts ,  Hawaii , and  Connecticut . Starting in 2009, Arkansas will be one of only two states among the states of the former  Confederacy  that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the other being  Virginia ).   Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, the  Democratic Party of Arkansas  is more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives are members of the  Blue Dog Coalition , which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the  Arkansas Constitution  Arkansas is a  right to work State , its voters passed a ban on  gay marriage  with 74% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful that has legislation on its books banning  abortion  in the event  Roe vs. Wade  is ever overturned.   In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.   Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are  term-limited  to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term. Arkansas gubernatorial terms became four years with the 1986 general election; before this, the terms were two years long.   Some of Arkansas's  counties  have two  county seats , as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.   Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw). [ 4 ]   Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the  Arkansas Constitution  is entitled ""Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,"" and states that ""No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court,"" despite unanimous decision by the  United States Supreme Court  in  Torcaso v. Watkins  (1961) that a similar requirement in  Maryland  violated protections under  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments to the Constitution.

(1997)  English Pronouncing Dictionary , 15th ed. Cambridge University Press.  ISBN 0-521-45272-4   ^  a   b   c  The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the  Territory of Arkansaw  on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the  Union  as the  State of Arkansas  on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced  /rkns/, /rknzs/ , and several other variants. In 1881, the  Arkansas General Assembly  passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):    Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.       And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.       Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final ""s"" silent, the ""a"" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of ""a"" in ""man"" and the sounding of the terminal ""s"" is an innovation to be discouraged.    Citizens of the  State of Kansas  often pronounce the  Arkansas River  as  IPA :  /rknzs rvr/  in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.   ^   Arkansas State Boundaries  from the  Encyclopedia of Arkansas   ^   ""Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth"" .

Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the  Mississippi River . Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the  Ozarks  and the  Ouachita Mountains , which make up the  U.S. Interior Highlands , to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is  Little Rock , located in the central portion of the state.

The Kansas tribe of American Indians are closely associated with the  Sioux  tribes. The word is a  French  pronunciation of a  Quapaw  (a related ""Kaw"" tribe) word meaning ""land of downriver people"" or ""people of the south wind"". The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881 after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name  /rknzs/   ar- KAN -zs  and the other wanted  /rkns/   AR -kn-saw . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Geography     See also:  List of Arkansas counties ,  List of cities in Arkansas ,  List of Arkansas townships , and  List of Arkansas native plants     The  Mississippi River  forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in  Clay  and  Greene  counties where the  St. Francis River  forms the western boundary of the  Missouri Bootheel , and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified. [ 5 ]  Arkansas shares its southern border with  Louisiana , its northern border with  Missouri , its eastern border with  Tennessee  and  Mississippi , and its western border with  Texas  and  Oklahoma .   Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. The so-called Lowlands are better known by names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The  Arkansas Delta  is a flat landscape of  rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding  of the adjacent Mississippi. Further away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.   The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as  Crowley's Ridge . A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet (150 m) above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.   Northwest Arkansas is part of the  Ozark Plateau  including the  Boston Mountains , to the south are the  Ouachita Mountains  and these regions are divided by the  Arkansas River ; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. All of these mountains ranges are part of the  U.S. Interior Highlands  region, the only major mountainous region between the  Rocky Mountains  and the  Appalachian Mountains . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The highest point in the state is  Mount Magazine  in the  Ozark Mountains ; it rises to 2,753 feet (839 m) above sea level.           Buffalo National River , one of many attractions that give the state's nickname  The Natural State .       Arkansas is home to many  caves , such as  Blanchard Springs Caverns . It is currently the only U.S. state in which  diamonds  are mined [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  (near  Murfreesboro ). Arkansas has the only operating diamond mine in the United States.   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the  National Park System . These include: [ 10 ]     Arkansas Post National Memorial  at  Gillett   Buffalo National River   Fort Smith National Historic Site   Hot Springs National Park   Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site   Pea Ridge National Military Park     The  Trail of Tears  National Historic Trail also runs through Arkansas. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Climate   Arkansas generally has a  humid subtropical climate , which borders on  humid continental  in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the  Gulf of Mexico , Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. In Little Rock, the daily high temperatures average around 90 F (32 C) in the summer and close to 50 F (10 C) in winter. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 to 1,500 mm); somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. [ 11 ]  Snowfall is not uncommon, but not excessive in most years, as the average snowfall is approximately five inches (13 cm). [ 12 ]   Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme weather. Between both the  Great Plains  and the  Gulf States , Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. As a part of  Tornado Alley , tornadoes are not an uncommon occurrence in Arkansas, and a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a  tropical system  which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.   High water pouring down the  White River  caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern Arkansas.

Arkansas is one of several  U.S. states  formed from the territory purchased from  Napoleon Bonaparte  in the  Louisiana Purchase . The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the  Illinois  word for the  Quapaw  people, who lived downriver from them [ 14 ] . Other  Native American  nations that lived in Arkansas prior to westward movement were the Quapaw,  Caddo , and  Osage  nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S.  Indian removal  policies), the  Five Civilized Tribes  inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.   The  Territory of Arkansaw [ 4 ]  was organized on July 4, 1819, and on June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the  Union  as the 25th  state  and the 13th  slave state . Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton, and this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.   Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of  Washington  to the Texas border involved the town in the  Texas Revolution  of 1835-36. Some evidence suggests  Sam Houston  and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834. [ 15 ]  When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.   When the  Mexican-American War  began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.   The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population. [ 16 ]   Arkansas refused to join the  Confederate States of America  until after  United States President   Abraham Lincoln  called for troops to respond to the attack on  Fort Sumter ,  South Carolina , by Confederate forces. The State of Arkansas seceded from the  Union  on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the  American Civil War . Arkansans of note during the Civil War included Confederate Major General  Patrick Cleburne . Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as ""The Stonewall of the West."" Also of note was Major General  Thomas C. Hindman . A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the  Battle of Cane Hill  and  Battle of Prairie Grove .   Under the  Military Reconstruction Act , Congress readmitted Arkansas in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage, a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. Years later, as conservative Democrats began to regain political power, the legislature passed a new constitution in 1874.   In 1874, the  Brooks-Baxter War , a political struggle between factions of the  Republican Party  shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President  Ulysses S. Grant  ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters. [ 17 ]   In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation, to combat a controversy then raging around the proper pronunciation of the state's name. (See Law and Government below).   After Reconstruction the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Some were originally recruited to work as farm labor in the developing Delta region. Some immigration continued into the early decades of the 20th century. The state witnessed numbers of  Chinese ,  Italian ,  Syrian  and immigrants from eastern Europe who made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In addition, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. The Chinese and Italians moved quickly out of positions as farm labor. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college. [ 18 ]   Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance,  Eureka Springs  in  Carroll County  grew to 10,000 people, having become a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its springs. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as  Hot Springs .   In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 the state constitution was amended to include a  poll tax  and related residency requirements, which adversely affected poor people and forced them from electoral rolls. By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the  white primary  in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process, as only in the primary was there any competition. The state was one-party for decades. [ 19 ]   Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of  German ,  Slovak , and  Irish  immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the  Prairie , and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly  Protestant  from  Ulster ,  Northern Ireland ,  United Kingdom   After the case of  Brown v. Topeka Board of Education  in 1954, the  Little Rock Nine  brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor  Orval Faubus  ordered the  Arkansas National Guard  to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated. [ 20 ]   Bill Clinton , the 42nd  President of the United States , was born in  Hope, Arkansas . Before his presidency, Clinton served nearly twelve years as the 40th and 42nd  Governor  of Arkansas.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 52,214 people (that is 198,800 births minus 146,586 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 57,611 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 21,947 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 35,664 people. It is estimated that about 48.8% is male, and 51.2% is female. From 2000 through 2006 Arkansas has had a population growth of 5.1% or 137,472. [ 22 ]  The population density of the state is 51.3 people per square mile.   The  center of population  of Arkansas is located in the far northeast corner of  Perry County .

[3]   People of European ancestry have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the fertile southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly  Scotch-Irish , Protestants from  Northern Ireland  and the  Scottish  lowlands, part of the largest group of immigrants from  Great Britain  and  Ireland  before the American Revolution. Scots-Irish settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. [ 24 ]   As of 2000, 95.07% of Arkansas residents age 5 and older speak  English  at home and 3.31% speak  Spanish .  German  is the third most spoken language at 0.299%, followed by  French  at 0.291% and  Vietnamese  at 0.13%. [ 25 ]   In 2006, Arkansas has a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 24% of adults smoking. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the  Bible Belt  and is predominantly Protestant. The religious affiliations of the people are as follows: [ 27 ]          Arkansas Population Density Map         Christian : 86%    Protestant : 78%    Baptist : 39%   Methodist : 9%   Pentecostal : 6%   Church of Christ [ disambiguation needed ] : 6%   Assemblies of God : 3%   Other Protestant: 15%       Roman Catholic : 7%   Orthodox Christian : <1%   Mormon/LDS : <.5%   Other Christian: <1%       Other religions: <1%   Non-religious: 14%     The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the  Southern Baptist Convention  with 665,307; the  United Methodist Church  with 179,383; the  Roman Catholic Church  with 115,967; and the  American Baptist Association  with 115,916. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Economy          The quarter for Arkansas, released  October 20  2003.       The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2004 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ 29 ]  The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.   Several global companies are headquartered in the northwest corner of Arkansas, including  Wal-Mart  (the world's largest public corporation by revenue in 2007), [ 30 ]   J.B. Hunt  and  Tyson Foods . This area of the state has experienced an economic boom since the 1970s as a result.   In recent years,  automobile  parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Additionally, the city of  Conway  is the site of a school bus factory.   Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname ""The Natural State"" was originally created (as ""Arkansas Is A Natural"") for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still regularly used to this day.   According to Forbes.com [ 31 ]  Arkansas currently ranks 21st for The Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8% or ranked 22nd.     [ edit ]   Taxation          A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn       Arkansas imposes a  state income tax  with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on  Social Security , or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions (in addition to recovery of  cost basis ). Residents of  Texarkana, Arkansas  are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of  Texarkana, Texas  are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ( sales ) tax and compensating ( use ) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.   In addition to the state sales tax, there are more than 300  local taxes  in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales  tax exemption  for  electricity  usage.   Sales of  alcoholic beverages  account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding  beer ) at  restaurants . A 4% tax is due on the sale of all  mixed drinks  (except beer and  wine ) sold for ""on-premises"" consumption. And a 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.   Property taxes  are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.

A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern  South , where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionnative son  Bill Clinton while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for  John McCain  in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady  Hillary Clinton's  failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the Arkansas Democratic Party regaining the governorship, and in 2008, Mark Pryor was re-elected without opposition.   Most Republican strength lies mainly in the areas around  Fort Smith  and  Bentonville , as well as North Central Arkansas around the  Mountain Home  area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the U.S. Senate since  Reconstruction ,  Tim Hutchinson , who was defeated after one term by  Mark Pryor . The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after  Massachusetts ,  Hawaii , and  Connecticut . Starting in 2009, Arkansas will be one of only two states among the states of the former  Confederacy  that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the other being  Virginia ).   Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, the  Democratic Party of Arkansas  is more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives are members of the  Blue Dog Coalition , which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the  Arkansas Constitution  Arkansas is a  right to work State , its voters passed a ban on  gay marriage  with 74% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful that has legislation on its books banning  abortion  in the event  Roe vs. Wade  is ever overturned.   In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.   Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are  term-limited  to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term. Arkansas gubernatorial terms became four years with the 1986 general election; before this, the terms were two years long.   Some of Arkansas's  counties  have two  county seats , as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.   Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw). [ 4 ]   Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the  Arkansas Constitution  is entitled ""Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,"" and states that ""No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court,"" despite unanimous decision by the  United States Supreme Court  in  Torcaso v. Watkins  (1961) that a similar requirement in  Maryland  violated protections under  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments to the Constitution.

(1997)  English Pronouncing Dictionary , 15th ed. Cambridge University Press.  ISBN 0-521-45272-4   ^  a   b   c  The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the  Territory of Arkansaw  on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the  Union  as the  State of Arkansas  on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced  /rkns/, /rknzs/ , and several other variants. In 1881, the  Arkansas General Assembly  passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):    Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.       And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.       Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final ""s"" silent, the ""a"" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of ""a"" in ""man"" and the sounding of the terminal ""s"" is an innovation to be discouraged.    Citizens of the  State of Kansas  often pronounce the  Arkansas River  as  IPA :  /rknzs rvr/  in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.   ^   Arkansas State Boundaries  from the  Encyclopedia of Arkansas   ^   ""Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth"" .

Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the  Mississippi River . Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the  Ozarks  and the  Ouachita Mountains , which make up the  U.S. Interior Highlands , to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is  Little Rock , located in the central portion of the state.

The Kansas tribe of American Indians are closely associated with the  Sioux  tribes. The word is a  French  pronunciation of a  Quapaw  (a related ""Kaw"" tribe) word meaning ""land of downriver people"" or ""people of the south wind"". The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881 after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name  /rknzs/   ar- KAN -zs  and the other wanted  /rkns/   AR -kn-saw . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Geography     See also:  List of Arkansas counties ,  List of cities in Arkansas ,  List of Arkansas townships , and  List of Arkansas native plants     The  Mississippi River  forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in  Clay  and  Greene  counties where the  St. Francis River  forms the western boundary of the  Missouri Bootheel , and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified. [ 5 ]  Arkansas shares its southern border with  Louisiana , its northern border with  Missouri , its eastern border with  Tennessee  and  Mississippi , and its western border with  Texas  and  Oklahoma .   Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. The so-called Lowlands are better known by names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The  Arkansas Delta  is a flat landscape of  rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding  of the adjacent Mississippi. Further away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.   The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as  Crowley's Ridge . A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet (150 m) above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.   Northwest Arkansas is part of the  Ozark Plateau  including the  Boston Mountains , to the south are the  Ouachita Mountains  and these regions are divided by the  Arkansas River ; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. All of these mountains ranges are part of the  U.S. Interior Highlands  region, the only major mountainous region between the  Rocky Mountains  and the  Appalachian Mountains . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The highest point in the state is  Mount Magazine  in the  Ozark Mountains ; it rises to 2,753 feet (839 m) above sea level.           Buffalo National River , one of many attractions that give the state's nickname  The Natural State .       Arkansas is home to many  caves , such as  Blanchard Springs Caverns . It is currently the only U.S. state in which  diamonds  are mined [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  (near  Murfreesboro ). Arkansas has the only operating diamond mine in the United States.   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the  National Park System . These include: [ 10 ]     Arkansas Post National Memorial  at  Gillett   Buffalo National River   Fort Smith National Historic Site   Hot Springs National Park   Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site   Pea Ridge National Military Park     The  Trail of Tears  National Historic Trail also runs through Arkansas. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Climate   Arkansas generally has a  humid subtropical climate , which borders on  humid continental  in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the  Gulf of Mexico , Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. In Little Rock, the daily high temperatures average around 90 F (32 C) in the summer and close to 50 F (10 C) in winter. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 to 1,500 mm); somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. [ 11 ]  Snowfall is not uncommon, but not excessive in most years, as the average snowfall is approximately five inches (13 cm). [ 12 ]   Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme weather. Between both the  Great Plains  and the  Gulf States , Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. As a part of  Tornado Alley , tornadoes are not an uncommon occurrence in Arkansas, and a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a  tropical system  which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.   High water pouring down the  White River  caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern Arkansas.

Arkansas is one of several  U.S. states  formed from the territory purchased from  Napoleon Bonaparte  in the  Louisiana Purchase . The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the  Illinois  word for the  Quapaw  people, who lived downriver from them [ 14 ] . Other  Native American  nations that lived in Arkansas prior to westward movement were the Quapaw,  Caddo , and  Osage  nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S.  Indian removal  policies), the  Five Civilized Tribes  inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.   The  Territory of Arkansaw [ 4 ]  was organized on July 4, 1819, and on June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the  Union  as the 25th  state  and the 13th  slave state . Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton, and this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.   Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of  Washington  to the Texas border involved the town in the  Texas Revolution  of 1835-36. Some evidence suggests  Sam Houston  and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834. [ 15 ]  When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.   When the  Mexican-American War  began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.   The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population. [ 16 ]   Arkansas refused to join the  Confederate States of America  until after  United States President   Abraham Lincoln  called for troops to respond to the attack on  Fort Sumter ,  South Carolina , by Confederate forces. The State of Arkansas seceded from the  Union  on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the  American Civil War . Arkansans of note during the Civil War included Confederate Major General  Patrick Cleburne . Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as ""The Stonewall of the West."" Also of note was Major General  Thomas C. Hindman . A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the  Battle of Cane Hill  and  Battle of Prairie Grove .   Under the  Military Reconstruction Act , Congress readmitted Arkansas in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage, a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. Years later, as conservative Democrats began to regain political power, the legislature passed a new constitution in 1874.   In 1874, the  Brooks-Baxter War , a political struggle between factions of the  Republican Party  shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President  Ulysses S. Grant  ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters. [ 17 ]   In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation, to combat a controversy then raging around the proper pronunciation of the state's name. (See Law and Government below).   After Reconstruction the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Some were originally recruited to work as farm labor in the developing Delta region. Some immigration continued into the early decades of the 20th century. The state witnessed numbers of  Chinese ,  Italian ,  Syrian  and immigrants from eastern Europe who made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In addition, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. The Chinese and Italians moved quickly out of positions as farm labor. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college. [ 18 ]   Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance,  Eureka Springs  in  Carroll County  grew to 10,000 people, having become a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its springs. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as  Hot Springs .   In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 the state constitution was amended to include a  poll tax  and related residency requirements, which adversely affected poor people and forced them from electoral rolls. By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the  white primary  in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process, as only in the primary was there any competition. The state was one-party for decades. [ 19 ]   Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of  German ,  Slovak , and  Irish  immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the  Prairie , and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly  Protestant  from  Ulster ,  Northern Ireland ,  United Kingdom   After the case of  Brown v. Topeka Board of Education  in 1954, the  Little Rock Nine  brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor  Orval Faubus  ordered the  Arkansas National Guard  to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated. [ 20 ]   Bill Clinton , the 42nd  President of the United States , was born in  Hope, Arkansas . Before his presidency, Clinton served nearly twelve years as the 40th and 42nd  Governor  of Arkansas.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 52,214 people (that is 198,800 births minus 146,586 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 57,611 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 21,947 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 35,664 people. It is estimated that about 48.8% is male, and 51.2% is female. From 2000 through 2006 Arkansas has had a population growth of 5.1% or 137,472. [ 22 ]  The population density of the state is 51.3 people per square mile.   The  center of population  of Arkansas is located in the far northeast corner of  Perry County .

[3]   People of European ancestry have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the fertile southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly  Scotch-Irish , Protestants from  Northern Ireland  and the  Scottish  lowlands, part of the largest group of immigrants from  Great Britain  and  Ireland  before the American Revolution. Scots-Irish settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. [ 24 ]   As of 2000, 95.07% of Arkansas residents age 5 and older speak  English  at home and 3.31% speak  Spanish .  German  is the third most spoken language at 0.299%, followed by  French  at 0.291% and  Vietnamese  at 0.13%. [ 25 ]   In 2006, Arkansas has a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 24% of adults smoking. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the  Bible Belt  and is predominantly Protestant. The religious affiliations of the people are as follows: [ 27 ]          Arkansas Population Density Map         Christian : 86%    Protestant : 78%    Baptist : 39%   Methodist : 9%   Pentecostal : 6%   Church of Christ [ disambiguation needed ] : 6%   Assemblies of God : 3%   Other Protestant: 15%       Roman Catholic : 7%   Orthodox Christian : <1%   Mormon/LDS : <.5%   Other Christian: <1%       Other religions: <1%   Non-religious: 14%     The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the  Southern Baptist Convention  with 665,307; the  United Methodist Church  with 179,383; the  Roman Catholic Church  with 115,967; and the  American Baptist Association  with 115,916. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Economy          The quarter for Arkansas, released  October 20  2003.       The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2004 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ 29 ]  The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.   Several global companies are headquartered in the northwest corner of Arkansas, including  Wal-Mart  (the world's largest public corporation by revenue in 2007), [ 30 ]   J.B. Hunt  and  Tyson Foods . This area of the state has experienced an economic boom since the 1970s as a result.   In recent years,  automobile  parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Additionally, the city of  Conway  is the site of a school bus factory.   Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname ""The Natural State"" was originally created (as ""Arkansas Is A Natural"") for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still regularly used to this day.   According to Forbes.com [ 31 ]  Arkansas currently ranks 21st for The Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8% or ranked 22nd.     [ edit ]   Taxation          A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn       Arkansas imposes a  state income tax  with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on  Social Security , or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions (in addition to recovery of  cost basis ). Residents of  Texarkana, Arkansas  are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of  Texarkana, Texas  are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ( sales ) tax and compensating ( use ) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.   In addition to the state sales tax, there are more than 300  local taxes  in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales  tax exemption  for  electricity  usage.   Sales of  alcoholic beverages  account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding  beer ) at  restaurants .

A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern  South , where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionnative son  Bill Clinton while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for  John McCain  in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady  Hillary Clinton's  failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the Arkansas Democratic Party regaining the governorship, and in 2008, Mark Pryor was re-elected without opposition.   Most Republican strength lies mainly in the areas around  Fort Smith  and  Bentonville , as well as North Central Arkansas around the  Mountain Home  area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the U.S. Senate since  Reconstruction ,  Tim Hutchinson , who was defeated after one term by  Mark Pryor . The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after  Massachusetts ,  Hawaii , and  Connecticut . Starting in 2009, Arkansas will be one of only two states among the states of the former  Confederacy  that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the other being  Virginia ).   Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, the  Democratic Party of Arkansas  is more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives are members of the  Blue Dog Coalition , which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the  Arkansas Constitution  Arkansas is a  right to work State , its voters passed a ban on  gay marriage  with 74% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful that has legislation on its books banning  abortion  in the event  Roe vs. Wade  is ever overturned.   In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.   Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are  term-limited  to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term. Arkansas gubernatorial terms became four years with the 1986 general election; before this, the terms were two years long.   Some of Arkansas's  counties  have two  county seats , as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.   Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw). [ 4 ]   Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the  Arkansas Constitution  is entitled ""Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,"" and states that ""No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court,"" despite unanimous decision by the  United States Supreme Court  in  Torcaso v. Watkins  (1961) that a similar requirement in  Maryland  violated protections under  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments to the Constitution.

(1997)  English Pronouncing Dictionary , 15th ed. Cambridge University Press.  ISBN 0-521-45272-4   ^  a   b   c  The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the  Territory of Arkansaw  on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the  Union  as the  State of Arkansas  on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced  /rkns/, /rknzs/ , and several other variants. In 1881, the  Arkansas General Assembly  passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):    Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.       And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.       Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final ""s"" silent, the ""a"" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of ""a"" in ""man"" and the sounding of the terminal ""s"" is an innovation to be discouraged.    Citizens of the  State of Kansas  often pronounce the  Arkansas River  as  IPA :  /rknzs rvr/  in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.   ^   Arkansas State Boundaries  from the  Encyclopedia of Arkansas   ^   ""Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth"" .

Arkansas shares a border with six states, with its eastern border largely defined by the  Mississippi River . Its diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the  Ozarks  and the  Ouachita Mountains , which make up the  U.S. Interior Highlands , to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River. The capital and most populous city is  Little Rock , located in the central portion of the state.

The Kansas tribe of American Indians are closely associated with the  Sioux  tribes. The word is a  French  pronunciation of a  Quapaw  (a related ""Kaw"" tribe) word meaning ""land of downriver people"" or ""people of the south wind"". The pronunciation of Arkansas was made official by an act of the state legislature in 1881 after a dispute between the two U.S. Senators from Arkansas. One wanted to pronounce the name  /rknzs/   ar- KAN -zs  and the other wanted  /rkns/   AR -kn-saw . [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Geography     See also:  List of Arkansas counties ,  List of cities in Arkansas ,  List of Arkansas townships , and  List of Arkansas native plants     The  Mississippi River  forms most of Arkansas's eastern border, except in  Clay  and  Greene  counties where the  St. Francis River  forms the western boundary of the  Missouri Bootheel , and in dozens of places where the current channel of the Mississippi has meandered from where it had last been legally specified. [ 5 ]  Arkansas shares its southern border with  Louisiana , its northern border with  Missouri , its eastern border with  Tennessee  and  Mississippi , and its western border with  Texas  and  Oklahoma .   Arkansas is a land of mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. The so-called Lowlands are better known by names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The  Arkansas Delta  is a flat landscape of  rich alluvial soils formed by repeated flooding  of the adjacent Mississippi. Further away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more undulating landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.   The Delta region is bisected by an unusual geological formation known as  Crowley's Ridge . A narrow band of rolling hills, Crowley's Ridge rises from 250 to 500 feet (150 m) above the surrounding alluvial plain and underlies many of the major towns of eastern Arkansas.   Northwest Arkansas is part of the  Ozark Plateau  including the  Boston Mountains , to the south are the  Ouachita Mountains  and these regions are divided by the  Arkansas River ; the southern and eastern parts of Arkansas are called the Lowlands. All of these mountains ranges are part of the  U.S. Interior Highlands  region, the only major mountainous region between the  Rocky Mountains  and the  Appalachian Mountains . [ 6 ] [ 7 ]  The highest point in the state is  Mount Magazine  in the  Ozark Mountains ; it rises to 2,753 feet (839 m) above sea level.           Buffalo National River , one of many attractions that give the state's nickname  The Natural State .       Arkansas is home to many  caves , such as  Blanchard Springs Caverns . It is currently the only U.S. state in which  diamonds  are mined [ 8 ] [ 9 ]  (near  Murfreesboro ). Arkansas has the only operating diamond mine in the United States.   Arkansas is home to many areas protected by the  National Park System . These include: [ 10 ]     Arkansas Post National Memorial  at  Gillett   Buffalo National River   Fort Smith National Historic Site   Hot Springs National Park   Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site   Pea Ridge National Military Park     The  Trail of Tears  National Historic Trail also runs through Arkansas. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Climate   Arkansas generally has a  humid subtropical climate , which borders on  humid continental  in some northern highland areas. While not bordering the  Gulf of Mexico , Arkansas is still close enough to this warm, large body of water for it to be the main weather influence in the state. Generally, Arkansas has very hot, humid summers and mild, slightly drier winters. In Little Rock, the daily high temperatures average around 90 F (32 C) in the summer and close to 50 F (10 C) in winter. Annual precipitation throughout the state averages between about 40 and 60 inches (1,000 to 1,500 mm); somewhat wetter in the south and drier in the northern part of the state. [ 11 ]  Snowfall is not uncommon, but not excessive in most years, as the average snowfall is approximately five inches (13 cm). [ 12 ]   Despite its subtropical climate, Arkansas is known for occasional extreme weather. Between both the  Great Plains  and the  Gulf States , Arkansas receives around 60 days of thunderstorms. As a part of  Tornado Alley , tornadoes are not an uncommon occurrence in Arkansas, and a few of the most destructive tornadoes in U.S. history have struck the state. While being sufficiently away from the coast to be safe from a direct hit from a hurricane, Arkansas can often get the remnants of a  tropical system  which dumps tremendous amounts of rain in a short time and often spawns smaller tornadoes.   High water pouring down the  White River  caused historic flooding in cities along its path in eastern Arkansas.

Arkansas is one of several  U.S. states  formed from the territory purchased from  Napoleon Bonaparte  in the  Louisiana Purchase . The early Spanish or French explorers of the state gave it its name, which is probably a phonetic spelling for the  Illinois  word for the  Quapaw  people, who lived downriver from them [ 14 ] . Other  Native American  nations that lived in Arkansas prior to westward movement were the Quapaw,  Caddo , and  Osage  nations. In their forced move westward (under U.S.  Indian removal  policies), the  Five Civilized Tribes  inhabited Arkansas during its territorial period.   The  Territory of Arkansaw [ 4 ]  was organized on July 4, 1819, and on June 15, 1836, the State of Arkansas was admitted to the  Union  as the 25th  state  and the 13th  slave state . Planters settled in the Delta to cultivate cotton, and this was the area of the state where most enslaved African Americans were held. Other areas had more subsistence farmers and mixed farming.   Arkansas played a key role in aiding Texas in its war for independence with Mexico, sending troops and materials to Texas to help fight the war. The proximity of the city of  Washington  to the Texas border involved the town in the  Texas Revolution  of 1835-36. Some evidence suggests  Sam Houston  and his compatriots planned the revolt in a tavern at Washington in 1834. [ 15 ]  When the fighting began, a stream of volunteers from Arkansas and the southeastern states flowed through the town toward the Texas battle fields.   When the  Mexican-American War  began in 1846, Washington became a rendezvous for volunteer troops. Governor Thomas S. Drew issued a proclamation calling on the state to furnish one regiment of cavalry and one battalion of infantry to join the United States Army. Ten companies of men assembled here where they were formed into the first Regiment of Arkansas Cavalry.   The state developed a cotton culture in the east in lands of the Mississippi Delta. This was where enslaved labor was used most extensively, as planters brought with them or imported slaves from the Upper South. On the eve of the Civil War in 1860, enslaved African Americans numbered 111,115 people, just over 25% of the state's population. [ 16 ]   Arkansas refused to join the  Confederate States of America  until after  United States President   Abraham Lincoln  called for troops to respond to the attack on  Fort Sumter ,  South Carolina , by Confederate forces. The State of Arkansas seceded from the  Union  on May 6, 1861. While not often cited in historical accounts, the state was the scene of numerous small-scale battles during the  American Civil War . Arkansans of note during the Civil War included Confederate Major General  Patrick Cleburne . Considered by many to be one of the most brilliant Confederate division commanders of the war, Cleburne was often referred to as ""The Stonewall of the West."" Also of note was Major General  Thomas C. Hindman . A former United States Representative, Hindman commanded Confederate forces at the  Battle of Cane Hill  and  Battle of Prairie Grove .   Under the  Military Reconstruction Act , Congress readmitted Arkansas in June 1868. The Reconstruction legislature established universal male suffrage, a public education system, and other general issues to improve the state and help more of the population. Years later, as conservative Democrats began to regain political power, the legislature passed a new constitution in 1874.   In 1874, the  Brooks-Baxter War , a political struggle between factions of the  Republican Party  shook Little Rock and the state governorship. It was settled only when President  Ulysses S. Grant  ordered Joseph Brooks to disperse his militant supporters. [ 17 ]   In 1881, the Arkansas state legislature enacted a bill that adopted an official pronunciation, to combat a controversy then raging around the proper pronunciation of the state's name. (See Law and Government below).   After Reconstruction the state began to receive more immigrants and migrants. Some were originally recruited to work as farm labor in the developing Delta region. Some immigration continued into the early decades of the 20th century. The state witnessed numbers of  Chinese ,  Italian ,  Syrian  and immigrants from eastern Europe who made the Delta more diverse than the rest of the state. In addition, some black migrants moved into the area because of opportunities to develop the bottomlands and own their own property. The Chinese and Italians moved quickly out of positions as farm labor. Many Chinese became such successful merchants in small towns that they were able to educate their children at college. [ 18 ]   Construction of railroads enabled more farmers to get their products to market. It also brought new development into different parts of the state, including the Ozarks. In a few years at the end of the 19th century, for instance,  Eureka Springs  in  Carroll County  grew to 10,000 people, having become a tourist destination and the fourth largest city of the state. It featured newly constructed, elegant resort hotels and spas planned around its springs. The town's attractions included horse racing and other entertainment. It appealed to a wide variety of classes, becoming almost as popular as  Hot Springs .   In the late 1880s, the worsening agricultural depression catalyzed Populist and third party movements, leading to interracial coalitions. Struggling to stay in power, in the 1890s the Democrats in Arkansas followed other Southern states in passing legislation and constitutional amendments that disfranchised blacks and poor whites. Democrats wanted to prevent their alliance. In 1891 state legislators passed a requirement for a literacy test, knowing that many blacks and whites would be excluded, at a time when more than 25% of the population could neither read nor write. In 1892 the state constitution was amended to include a  poll tax  and related residency requirements, which adversely affected poor people and forced them from electoral rolls. By 1900 the Democratic Party expanded use of the  white primary  in county and state elections, further denying blacks a part in the political process, as only in the primary was there any competition. The state was one-party for decades. [ 19 ]   Between 1905 and 1911, Arkansas began to receive a small migration of  German ,  Slovak , and  Irish  immigrants. The German and Slovak peoples settled in the eastern part of the state known as the  Prairie , and the Irish founded small communities in the southeast part of the state. The Germans were mostly Catholic and the Slovaks were Lutheran. The Irish were mostly  Protestant  from  Ulster ,  Northern Ireland ,  United Kingdom   After the case of  Brown v. Topeka Board of Education  in 1954, the  Little Rock Nine  brought Arkansas to national attention when the Federal government intervened to protect African-American students trying to integrate a high school in the Arkansas capital. Governor  Orval Faubus  ordered the  Arkansas National Guard  to aid segregationists in preventing nine African-American students from enrolling at Little Rock's Central High School. After attempting three times to contact Faubus, President  Dwight D. Eisenhower  sent 1000 troops from the active-duty 101st Airborne Division to escort and protect the African-American students as they entered school on September 25, 1957. In defiance of federal court orders to integrate, the governor and city of Little Rock decided to close the high schools for the remainder of the school year. By the fall of 1959, the Little Rock high schools were completely integrated. [ 20 ]   Bill Clinton , the 42nd  President of the United States , was born in  Hope, Arkansas . Before his presidency, Clinton served nearly twelve years as the 40th and 42nd  Governor  of Arkansas.

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 52,214 people (that is 198,800 births minus 146,586 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 57,611 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 21,947 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 35,664 people. It is estimated that about 48.8% is male, and 51.2% is female. From 2000 through 2006 Arkansas has had a population growth of 5.1% or 137,472. [ 22 ]  The population density of the state is 51.3 people per square mile.   The  center of population  of Arkansas is located in the far northeast corner of  Perry County .

[3]   People of European ancestry have a strong presence in the northwestern Ozarks and the central part of the state. African Americans live mainly in the fertile southern and eastern parts of the state. Arkansans of Irish, English and German ancestry are mostly found in the far northwestern Ozarks near the Missouri border. Ancestors of Irish in the Ozarks were chiefly  Scotch-Irish , Protestants from  Northern Ireland  and the  Scottish  lowlands, part of the largest group of immigrants from  Great Britain  and  Ireland  before the American Revolution. Scots-Irish settled throughout the backcountry of the South and in the more mountainous areas. [ 24 ]   As of 2000, 95.07% of Arkansas residents age 5 and older speak  English  at home and 3.31% speak  Spanish .  German  is the third most spoken language at 0.299%, followed by  French  at 0.291% and  Vietnamese  at 0.13%. [ 25 ]   In 2006, Arkansas has a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 24% of adults smoking. [ 26 ]     [ edit ]   Religion   Arkansas, like most other Southern states, is part of the  Bible Belt  and is predominantly Protestant. The religious affiliations of the people are as follows: [ 27 ]          Arkansas Population Density Map         Christian : 86%    Protestant : 78%    Baptist : 39%   Methodist : 9%   Pentecostal : 6%   Church of Christ [ disambiguation needed ] : 6%   Assemblies of God : 3%   Other Protestant: 15%       Roman Catholic : 7%   Orthodox Christian : <1%   Other Christian: <1%       Other religions: <1%   Non-religious: 14%     The largest denominations by number of adherents in 2000 were the  Southern Baptist Convention  with 665,307; the  United Methodist Church  with 179,383; the  Roman Catholic Church  with 115,967; and the  American Baptist Association  with 115,916. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Economy          The quarter for Arkansas, released  October 20  2003.       The state's gross domestic product for 2005 was $87 billion. Its per capita household median income (in current dollars) for 2004 was $35,295, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. [ 29 ]  The state's agriculture outputs are poultry and eggs, soybeans, sorghum, cattle, cotton, rice, hogs, and milk. Its industrial outputs are food processing, electric equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, paper products, bromine, and vanadium.   Several global companies are headquartered in the northwest corner of Arkansas, including  Wal-Mart  (the world's largest public corporation by revenue in 2007), [ 30 ]   J.B. Hunt  and  Tyson Foods . This area of the state has experienced an economic boom since the 1970s as a result.   In recent years,  automobile  parts manufacturers have opened factories in eastern Arkansas to support auto plants in other states. Additionally, the city of  Conway  is the site of a school bus factory.   Tourism is also very important to the Arkansas economy; the official state nickname ""The Natural State"" was originally created (as ""Arkansas Is A Natural"") for state tourism advertising in the 1970s, and is still regularly used to this day.   According to Forbes.com [ 31 ]  Arkansas currently ranks 21st for The Best States for Business, 9th for Business Cost, 40th for Labor, 22nd for Regulatory Environment, 17th for Economic Climate, 9th for Growth Prospects, 34th in Gross Domestic Product, and positive economic change of 3.8% or ranked 22nd.     [ edit ]   Taxation          A map of Arkansas with county boundaries drawn       Arkansas imposes a  state income tax  with six brackets, ranging from 1.0% to 7.0%. The first $9,000 of military pay of enlisted personnel is exempt from Arkansas tax; officers do not have to pay state income tax on the first $6,000 of their military pay. Retirees pay no tax on  Social Security , or on the first $6,000 in gain on their pensions (in addition to recovery of  cost basis ). Residents of  Texarkana, Arkansas  are exempt from Arkansas income tax; wages and business income earned there by residents of  Texarkana, Texas  are also exempt. Arkansas's gross receipts ( sales ) tax and compensating ( use ) tax rate is currently 6%. The state has also mandated that various services be subject to sales tax collection. They include wrecker and towing services; dry cleaning and laundry; body piercing, tattooing and electrolysis; pest control; security and alarm monitoring; self-storage facilities; boat storage and docking; and pet grooming and kennel services.   In addition to the state sales tax, there are more than 300  local taxes  in Arkansas. Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales  tax exemption  for  electricity  usage.   Sales of  alcoholic beverages  account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding  beer ) at  restaurants . A 4% tax is due on the sale of all  mixed drinks  (except beer and  wine ) sold for ""on-premises"" consumption. And a 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.   Property taxes  are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.

A majority of local and statewide offices are also held by Democrats. This is rare in the modern  South , where a majority of statewide offices are held by Republicans. Arkansas had the distinction in 1992 of being the only state in the country to give the majority of its vote to a single candidate in the presidential electionnative son  Bill Clinton while every other state's electoral votes were won by pluralities of the vote among the three candidates. Arkansas has become more reliably Republican in presidential elections in recent years. The state voted for  John McCain  in 2008 by a margin of 20 percentage points, making it one of the few states in the country to vote more Republican than it had in 2004. Obama's relatively poor showing in Arkansas was likely due to a lack of enthusiasm from state Democrats following former Arkansas First Lady  Hillary Clinton's  failure to win the nomination, and his relatively poor performance among rural white voters. However, the Democratic presence remains strong on the state level; in 2006, Democrats were elected to all statewide offices by the voters in a Democratic sweep that included the Arkansas Democratic Party regaining the governorship, and in 2008, Mark Pryor was re-elected without opposition.   Most Republican strength lies mainly in the areas around  Fort Smith  and  Bentonville , as well as North Central Arkansas around the  Mountain Home  area. In the latter area, Republicans have been known to get 90 percent or more of the vote. The rest of the state is more Democratic. Arkansas has only elected one Republican to the U.S. Senate since  Reconstruction ,  Tim Hutchinson , who was defeated after one term by  Mark Pryor . The General Assembly has not been controlled by the Republican Party since Reconstruction and is the fourth most heavily Democratic Legislature in the country, after  Massachusetts ,  Hawaii , and  Connecticut . Starting in 2009, Arkansas will be one of only two states among the states of the former  Confederacy  that sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate (the other being  Virginia ).   Although Democrats have an overwhelming majority of registered voters, the  Democratic Party of Arkansas  is more conservative than the national entity. Two of Arkansas' three Democratic Representatives are members of the  Blue Dog Coalition , which tends to be more pro-business, pro-military, and socially conservative than the center-left Democratic mainstream. Reflecting the state's large evangelical population, the state has a strong social conservative bent. Under the  Arkansas Constitution  Arkansas is a  right to work State , its voters passed a ban on  gay marriage  with 74% voting yes, and the state is one of a handful that has legislation on its books banning  abortion  in the event  Roe vs. Wade  is ever overturned.   In Arkansas, the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor and thus can be from a different political party.   Each officer's term is four years long. Office holders are  term-limited  to two full terms plus any partial terms prior to the first full term. Arkansas gubernatorial terms became four years with the 1986 general election; before this, the terms were two years long.   Some of Arkansas's  counties  have two  county seats , as opposed to the usual one seat. The arrangement dates back to when travel was extremely difficult in the state. The seats are usually on opposite sides of the county. Though travel is no longer the difficulty it once was, there are few efforts to eliminate the two seat arrangement where it exists, since the county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) to the city involved.   Arkansas is the only state to specify the pronunciation of its name by law (AR-kan-saw). [ 4 ]   Article 19 (Miscellaneous Provisions), Item 1 in the  Arkansas Constitution  is entitled ""Atheists disqualified from holding office or testifying as witness,"" and states that ""No person who denies the being of a God shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State, nor be competent to testify as a witness in any Court,"" despite unanimous decision by the  United States Supreme Court  in  Torcaso v. Watkins  (1961) that a similar requirement in  Maryland  violated protections under  First  and  Fourteenth  Amendments to the Constitution.

(1997)  English Pronouncing Dictionary , 15th ed. Cambridge University Press.  ISBN 0-521-45272-4   ^  a   b   c  The name Arkansas has been pronounced and spelled in a variety of fashions. The region was organized as the  Territory of Arkansaw  on July 4, 1819, but the territory was admitted to the  Union  as the  State of Arkansas  on June 15, 1836. The name was historically pronounced  /rkns/, /rknzs/ , and several other variants. In 1881, the  Arkansas General Assembly  passed the following concurrent resolution (Arkansas Statutes, Title 1, Chapter 4, Section 105):    Whereas, confusion of practice has arisen in the pronunciation of the name of our state and it is deemed important that the true pronunciation should be determined for use in oral official proceedings.       And, whereas, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by the State Historical Society and the Eclectic Society of Little Rock, which have agreed upon the correct pronunciation as derived from history, and the early usage of the American immigrants.       Be it therefore resolved by both houses of the General Assembly, that the only true pronunciation of the name of the state, in the opinion of this body, is that received by the French from the native Indians and committed to writing in the French word representing the sound. It should be pronounced in three (3) syllables, with the final ""s"" silent, the ""a"" in each syllable with the Italian sound, and the accent on the first and last syllables. The pronunciation with the accent on the second syllable with the sound of ""a"" in ""man"" and the sounding of the terminal ""s"" is an innovation to be discouraged.    Citizens of the  State of Kansas  often pronounce the  Arkansas River  as  IPA :  /rknzs rvr/  in a manner similar to the common pronunciation of the name of their state.   ^   Arkansas State Boundaries  from the  Encyclopedia of Arkansas   ^   ""Managing Upland Forests of the Midsouth"" .
